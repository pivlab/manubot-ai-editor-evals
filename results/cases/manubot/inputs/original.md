Since its creation to facilitate the Deep Review, Manubot has been used to write a variety of scholarly documents. The [Sci-Hub Coverage Study](https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript) --- performed openly on GitHub from its inception --- investigated Sci-Hub's repository of pirated articles [@doi:10.7554/eLife.32822]. Sci-Hub [reviewed](https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/issues/17) the initial preprint from this study in a series of tweets, pointing out a major error in one of the analyses. Within hours, the authors used Markdown's strikethrough formatting in Manubot to cross-out the errant sentences ([commit](https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/commit/8fcd0cd665f6fb5f39bed7e26b940aa27d4770ba), [versioned manuscript](https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/v/8fcd0cd665f6fb5f39bed7e26b940aa27d4770ba/)), thereby alerting readers to the mistake and preventing further propagation of misinformation. One month later, a larger [set of revisions](https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/pull/19) explained the error in more detail and was included in a second version of the preprint. As such, continuous publication via Manubot helped the authors address the error without delay, while retaining a public version history of the process. This Sci-Hub Coverage Study preprint was the [most viewed](http://web.archive.org/web/20171221221858/http://www.prepubmed.org/top_preprints/) 2017 _PeerJ Preprint_, while the Deep Review was the most viewed 2017 _bioRxiv_ preprint [@doi:10.1038/d41586-017-08493-x]. Hence, in Manubot's first year, two of the most popular preprints were written using its collaborative, open, and review-driven authoring process.
