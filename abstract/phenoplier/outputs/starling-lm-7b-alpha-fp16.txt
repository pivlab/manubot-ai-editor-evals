          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
          perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
          base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.
      response:
        output: ' Genes work in concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, it is essential to understand the regulation of expression across various conditions. This knowledge has proven critical for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, current models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origin and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

           We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that synthesizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts; understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have begun to elucidate the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease genesis and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for decoding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In this revised abstract, we have focused on emphasizing the novelty
          and significance of PhenoPLIER as a computational approach that not
          only provides a shared latent space for integrated analysis but also
          offers new perspectives on genetic associations through gene modules.
          The abstract now highlights the importance of understanding gene-gene
          interactions in disease progression, which was previously mentioned
          but not emphasized. Additionally, we have introduced the concept of
          CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, adding a new dimension
          to the study's methodology and findings.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits. This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

           The study of genetic associations has long been a focus in the field of functional genomics, with the aim of understanding complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. However, current methodologies often fail to account for the fact that genes act in concert with each other to influence these traits. This study seeks to address this gap by investigating the role of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. 

          In this research, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER,
          which uses gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to identify
          significant associations between diseases and gene expression
          patterns. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately
          predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their mechanisms of
          action. 


          Furthermore, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          finding that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests
          that our method can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. 


          In conclusion, the integration of co-expressed gene groups allows
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and provide a more
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          This novel framework offers significant advancements in the
          interpretation of genetic associations and holds great potential for
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in functional genomics
          research.

           Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across varying conditions, which is crucial for therapy development. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating disease etiology and drug mechanism elucidation in genetic studies, functional genomics, and therapeutic target identification.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the revised abstract, I have emphasized the importance of
          understanding gene collaborations and their role in disease
          mechanisms. Additionally, I have introduced PhenoPLIER as a

          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. The revised abstract also highlights the
          significance of disease associations with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and the accuracy of predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and mechanisms of action using PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes, a gap remains in linking these findings to pharmacological perturbations and developing new therapies. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Through our analysis, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our approach offers a promising framework for enhancing therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing in the context of gene co-expression and complex traits.'

            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

               Genes work in concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, it is essential to understand the regulation of expression across various conditions. This knowledge has proven critical for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, current models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origin and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that synthesizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts; understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have begun to elucidate the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease genesis and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for decoding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In this revised abstract, we have focused on emphasizing the
              novelty and significance of PhenoPLIER as a computational approach
              that not only provides a shared latent space for integrated
              analysis but also offers new perspectives on genetic associations
              through gene modules. The abstract now highlights the importance
              of understanding gene-gene interactions in disease progression,
              which was previously mentioned but not emphasized. Additionally,
              we have introduced the concept of CRISPR screening to analyze
              lipid regulation, adding a new dimension to the study's
              methodology and findings.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits. This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               The study of genetic associations has long been a focus in the field of functional genomics, with the aim of understanding complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. However, current methodologies often fail to account for the fact that genes act in concert with each other to influence these traits. This study seeks to address this gap by investigating the role of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. 

              In this research, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER,
              which uses gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to
              identify significant associations between diseases and gene
              expression patterns. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their
              mechanisms of action. 


              Furthermore, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, finding that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This suggests that our method can reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. 


              In conclusion, the integration of co-expressed gene groups allows
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and provide a
              more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This novel framework offers significant advancements
              in the interpretation of genetic associations and holds great
              potential for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in
              functional genomics research.

               Understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions is critical for uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the revised abstract, I have emphasized the importance of
              understanding gene collaborations and their role in disease
              mechanisms. Additionally, I have introduced PhenoPLIER as a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. The revised abstract also
              highlights the significance of disease associations with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types and the accuracy of
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action using
              PhenoPLIER.

               Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for deciphering the influence of these genes on complex traits. Insights into this regulation are vital for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern architectural models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               In the context of functional genomics and gene co-expression, understanding the interplay of genes in regulating complex traits is vital for unraveling disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease onset and progression remains unclear. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
