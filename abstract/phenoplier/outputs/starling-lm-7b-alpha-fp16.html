Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across various conditions, a realization crucial for therapy development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated individual gene roles in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to disease onset and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally essential genes lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[PASS] (1.00)  Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions.

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across different conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapies.

 This study aims to address the gap in current understanding of genetic associations and their role in disease etiology by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. The context lies in the recognition that genes often act in concert with each other to perform their functions, and understanding their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. Traditionally, transcriptome-wide association studies have focused on individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, revealing that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The content demonstrates PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as prioritizing functionally important players in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

 Genes work in coordinated fashion within specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions for deciphering how they influence complex traits. This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

 Genes collaborate in specific contexts to fulfill their functions, necessitating a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This understanding is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In the revised abstract, we emphasize the importance of understanding gene expression regulation and its relevance to therapy development. We introduce PhenoPLIER as a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The paragraph highlights the significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

 Genes collaborate in specific contexts to fulfill their functions, necessitating a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This understanding is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In the revised abstract, we emphasize the importance of understanding gene expression regulation and its relevance to therapy development. We introduce PhenoPLIER as a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The paragraph highlights the significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Lastly, we discuss the CRISPR screen analysis, which demonstrates the prioritization of functionally important players within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>
