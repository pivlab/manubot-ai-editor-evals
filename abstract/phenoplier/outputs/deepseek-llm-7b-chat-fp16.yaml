          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in concert, and
          determining how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression.


          PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach designed to map
          gene-trait associations into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. This method leverages
          modules of genes expressing similar patterns across the same
          conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and
          these cell type-specific gene modules. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action.


          Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis framework
          can provide a new perspective on genetic associations and potentially
          uncover novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through gene modules, providing valuable insights into
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms for the benefit of developing
          effective treatments and therapies.

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Gene function is influenced by the interplay of genes working together
          in specific contexts. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across diverse conditions is crucial for identifying
          complex traits' underlying genetic associations. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have uncovered individual genes' role in disease
          mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a significant part in diseases' origin and progression.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This model is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. We found that disease traits are significantly
          associated with gene expression modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          while inferring their mechanisms of action.


          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          identified functionally important players lacking associations but
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes enables
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. By employing this framework,
          PhenoPLIER provides a new perspective for interpreting genetic
          relationships through the lens of gene modules.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the study of complex genetic traits, genes work together to perform
          their functions in specific contexts. A mechanistic understanding of
          gene expression regulation is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
          progression.


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach introduced to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This method uses modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          revealing how diseases are significantly associated with these modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by interpreting
          genetic associations through gene modules.


          Furthermore, a CRISPR screen was conducted to analyze lipid
          regulation, highlighting functional players that lack associations but
          are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER.
          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the
          analysis can help contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, offering promising
          prospects for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery in
          complex diseases.

          PhenoPLIER: A computational framework for projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns


          In complex traits, genes act in concert to perform their functions.
          Understanding these interactions requires a mechanistic understanding
          of expression regulation across different conditions. PhenoPLIER is a
          novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis, bridging the gap between genetic studies and
          functional genomics.


          We demonstrate how this method can highlight disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms by analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS).
          We show significant associations of diseases with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, revealing novel therapeutic targets
          and drug repurposing opportunities missed by single-gene strategies.
          Additionally, we validate PhenoPLIER's accuracy using CRISPR screens
          to analyze lipid regulation, finding functional players prioritized in
          trait-associated modules despite lacking direct associations.


          In conclusion, our work highlights the potential of gene co-expression
          patterns for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a
          valuable resource for advancing personalized medicine and improving
          patient outcomes. PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene module analysis, offering insights
          into complex traits that were previously inaccessible.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER, a computational method for mapping genetic associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation, enables joint analysis of complex traits. We propose
          that genes act together to perform their functions, highlighting the
          need for a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions in order to develop new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shown that individual gene
          roles are crucial in disease mechanisms; however, modern models
          predict a significant role for gene-gene interactions in complex
          traits' origin and progression.


          PhenoPLIER employs modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions to associate diseases with specific cell
          types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          their mechanism of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen
          focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
          players are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER
          but lack associations themselves.


          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework
          for interpreting complex traits through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In recent years, functional genomics has emerged as a critical tool to
          elucidate the complex interplay between genes and their roles in
          various contexts. Understanding gene expression regulation across
          different conditions is essential for identifying mechanisms that
          influence intricate traits like diseases. The concept of integrating
          genetic studies with functional genomics offers potential avenues for
          drug repurposing by pinpointing relevant therapeutic targets, thus
          enhancing disease management.


          Our study aims to project the association between genes and complex
          traits through their co-expression patterns in various cell types. Our
          approach, PhenoPLIER, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation, we highlight functionally important players that
          lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules.


          In conclusion, the incorporation of gene co-expression patterns
          through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting complex traits by
          elucidating the interplay between genes and diseases. By unveiling
          molecular mechanisms behind disease etiology and therapeutic targets,
          our study contributes to the development of innovative drug
          repurposing approaches for diverse health conditions.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          This study aims to bridge the gap in genetic studies by investigating
          gene co-expression patterns and their implications for disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. The context is set by highlighting the
          importance of understanding functional genomics, particularly in
          predicting complex traits like diseases that are associated with
          multiple genes acting together. Our novel approach, PhenoPLIER,
          utilizes clustering techniques to identify relevant gene modules and
          contextualize genetic associations, ultimately providing a framework
          for interpreting genetic data through the lens of co-expressed genes.
          By focusing on disease-associated gene modules in various cell types,
          our study not only predicts known drug-disease pairs but also
          discovers novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies
          using CRISPR screening. The findings highlight the potential of
          PhenoPLIER to guide drug repurposing efforts and contribute towards
          advancing functional genomics research for complex trait analysis.

          Genes interact and collaborate to perform their functions, forming
          gene modules that influence complex traits. A mechanistic
          understanding of these interactions is crucial for developing novel
          therapies. In this study, we show that diseases are significantly
          associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types
          using functional genomics approaches. Our results accurately predict
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we
          identify functionally important players lacking associations but
          prioritized in trait-associated modules via our PhenoPLIER framework.
          In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes through the
          PhenoPLIER approach contextualizes genetic associations, revealing
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework enables a deeper understanding of genetic etiology and
          uncovers novel therapeutic opportunities.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          highlighting the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
          disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in complex trait origins and
          progression. 


          To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          suitable for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules
          of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions,
          enabling us to identify disease associations with these gene modules.
          Our findings demonstrate accurate prediction of known drug-disease
          pairs and the elucidation of mechanisms of action in complex diseases.


          Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          analysis, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          identified by PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the potential of
          functional genomics to uncover new therapeutic targets and repurpose
          existing drugs for treating various complex diseases.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics aims to uncover
          how genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions.
          A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          diverse conditions is crucial for developing new therapies that target
          complex traits. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
          identified individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital for elucidating the
          origin and progression of diseases.


          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational
          approach to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for
          joint analysis. By representing genes based on their similar
          expression patterns across various conditions, we identify disease
          modules associated with distinct cell types and accurately predict
          known drug-disease pairs along with mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation,
          our findings reveal that functionally significant players are
          underrepresented in trait-associated modules but prioritize by
          PhenoPLIER's module prioritization. Consequently, this study
          significantly contributes to the field by providing a mechanism for
          drug repurposing and identifying new therapeutic targets.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in concert with one

          PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and

          Moreover, we have utilized a CRISPR screen for analyzing lipid

          demonstrate the power and utility of PhenoPLIER as a tool to project
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby
          unraveling disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          gene expression patterns is crucial in determining how genes influence
          complex traits. However, traditional methods fail to capture gene-gene
          interactions essential for disease etiology and progression. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across relevant cell types, enabling the
          identification of disease-associated gene modules and predicting drug
          repurposing. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we
          demonstrate that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking associations
          themselves. These findings contribute to advancing drug discovery and
          understanding complex diseases, highlighting the potential for further
          research in this area.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in concert, and

              leverages modules of genes expressing similar patterns across the

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of

              Gene function is influenced by the interplay of genes working
              together in specific contexts. A mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across diverse conditions is crucial for
              identifying complex traits' underlying genetic associations.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual
              genes' role in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in diseases'
              origin and progression.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map
              gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This model
              is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We found that disease traits
              are significantly associated with gene expression modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms
              of action.


              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              identified functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes enables
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By employing
              this framework, PhenoPLIER provides a new perspective for
              interpreting genetic relationships through the lens of gene
              modules.

              In the study of complex genetic traits, genes work together to

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              to map genetic associations with complex traits into a common

              PhenoPLIER: A computational framework for projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns


              In complex traits, genes act in concert to perform their
              functions. Understanding these interactions requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis, bridging the
              gap between genetic studies and functional genomics.


              We demonstrate how this method can highlight disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms by analyzing transcriptome-wide association
              studies (TWAS). We show significant associations of diseases with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, revealing novel
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities missed by
              single-gene strategies. Additionally, we validate PhenoPLIER's
              accuracy using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, finding
              functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules despite
              lacking direct associations.


              In conclusion, our work highlights the potential of gene
              co-expression patterns for disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
              providing a valuable resource for advancing personalized medicine
              and improving patient outcomes. PhenoPLIER offers a new framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through gene module
              analysis, offering insights into complex traits that were

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              PhenoPLIER, a computational method for mapping genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation, enables joint analysis of complex traits.
              We propose that genes act together to perform their functions,
              highlighting the need for a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions in order to
              develop new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shown that individual gene roles are crucial in disease
              mechanisms; however, modern models predict a significant role for
              gene-gene interactions in complex traits' origin and progression.


              PhenoPLIER employs modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions to associate diseases with
              specific cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring their mechanism of action. Moreover, utilizing
              a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
              gene modules by PhenoPLIER but lack associations themselves.


              In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
              novel framework for interpreting complex traits through the lens
              of gene modules.

              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By determining how genes act in concert with each other
              across different conditions, we gain mechanistic insight into

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shown that individual

              predict gene-gene interactions as crucial for understanding

              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We

              In recent years, functional genomics has emerged as a critical
              tool to elucidate the complex interplay between genes and their
              roles in various contexts. Understanding gene expression
              regulation across different conditions is essential for
              identifying mechanisms that influence intricate traits like
              diseases. The concept of integrating genetic studies with
              functional genomics offers potential avenues for drug repurposing
              by pinpointing relevant therapeutic targets, thus enhancing
              disease management.


              Our study aims to project the association between genes and
              complex traits through their co-expression patterns in various
              cell types. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we highlight
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, the incorporation of gene co-expression patterns
              through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              novel framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting complex
              traits by elucidating the interplay between genes and diseases. By
              unveiling molecular mechanisms behind disease etiology and
              therapeutic targets, our study contributes to the development of
              innovative drug repurposing approaches for diverse health
              conditions.

              This study aims to bridge the gap in genetic studies by
              investigating gene co-expression patterns and their implications
              for disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The context is set by
              highlighting the importance of understanding functional genomics,
              particularly in predicting complex traits like diseases that are
              associated with multiple genes acting together. Our novel
              approach, PhenoPLIER, utilizes clustering techniques to identify
              relevant gene modules and contextualize genetic associations,
              ultimately providing a framework for interpreting genetic data
              through the lens of co-expressed genes. By focusing on
              disease-associated gene modules in various cell types, our study
              not only predicts known drug-disease pairs but also discovers
              novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies using
              CRISPR screening. The findings highlight the potential of
              PhenoPLIER to guide drug repurposing efforts and contribute
              towards advancing functional genomics research for complex trait
              analysis.

              Genes interact and collaborate to perform their functions, forming
              gene modules that influence complex traits. A mechanistic
              understanding of these interactions is crucial for developing
              novel therapies. In this study, we show that diseases are
              significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types using functional genomics approaches. Our
              results accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation
              using a CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules
              via our PhenoPLIER framework. In conclusion, integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes through the PhenoPLIER approach contextualizes
              genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. This novel framework enables a deeper
              understanding of genetic etiology and uncovers novel therapeutic
              opportunities.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              highlighting the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in
              complex trait origins and progression. 


              To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation suitable for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              relevant conditions, enabling us to identify disease associations
              with these gene modules. Our findings demonstrate accurate
              prediction of known drug-disease pairs and the elucidation of
              mechanisms of action in complex diseases.


              Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              analysis, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              identified by PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the potential of
              functional genomics to uncover new therapeutic targets and
              repurpose existing drugs for treating various complex diseases.

              In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics aims to
              uncover how genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute
              their functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across diverse conditions is crucial for developing new
              therapies that target complex traits. Although transcriptome-wide
              association studies have identified individual gene roles in
              disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are vital for elucidating the origin and progression
              of diseases.


              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational
              approach to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for
              joint analysis. By representing genes based on their similar
              expression patterns across various conditions, we identify disease
              modules associated with distinct cell types and accurately predict
              known drug-disease pairs along with mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
              regulation, our findings reveal that functionally significant
              players are underrepresented in trait-associated modules but
              prioritize by PhenoPLIER's module prioritization. Consequently,
              this study significantly contributes to the field by providing a
              mechanism for drug repurposing and identifying new therapeutic
              targets.

              to project genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
              thereby unraveling disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding gene expression patterns is crucial in determining

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
