          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to

          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association

          Gene co-expression plays a crucial role in determining complex traits,
          as individual genes function together to perform their functions. A
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions is essential for developing new therapies, as it
          aids in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms
          via transcriptome-wide association studies. However, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are key drivers of complex traits
          and disease progression.


          To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This model is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to
          identify significant relationships between diseases and specific cell
          types as well as accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action.


          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we find
          that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER even if they lack associations
          themselves. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes
          through the use of PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
          providing a novel framework for interpreting complex traits via gene
          modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The study of complex traits and diseases necessitates a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association
          studies, the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin
          and progression remains unaddressed. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By identifying modules of co-expressed genes with
          similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms
          of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen reveals functional players
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting
          missed potential targets by single-gene strategies. Consequently,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through gene modules, contextualizing complex traits and
          diseases with improved precision and efficiency in drug repurposing
          efforts.

          Genes function in concert to perform their functions and determine
          complex traits require a mechanistic understanding of expression

          studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease

          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations into a common latent representation for joint analysis,
          using modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          modules expressed in relevant cell types and found our method to
          accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of

          Using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we identified functionally

          Complex traits result from the coordinated actions of multiple genes,
          emphasizing the importance of understanding gene expression regulation
          for disease etiology and therapy development. However, current methods
          fail to account for genetic interactions in complex trait analysis
          (Zhang et al., 2018). This study fills this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach mapping gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed
          genes. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
          enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
          modules offers promising opportunities for drug repurposing and
          disease treatment development.

          Genes collaborate in concert with each other to perform their
          functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic approach that considers expression regulation
          across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.


          PhenoPLIER is a computational method for mapping gene-trait
          associations into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
          It does so by integrating modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, demonstrating that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules provides valuable insights into
          understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

          In the context of genetic studies and functional genomics, identifying
          gene co-expression patterns is crucial for understanding complex
          traits and disease etiology. However, current methods struggle to
          capture the full complexity of gene interactions involved in these
          processes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation

          identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types while accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by uncovering
          functional players missing from lipid regulation that are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen. In conclusion,
          integrating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER enables
          contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides
          valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex
          traits and can be leveraged for drug repurposing efforts, ultimately
          advancing our understanding of human diseases and their treatment
          options.

          The study fills an important gap in our understanding of complex
          diseases by projecting genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns. Functional genomics and co-expression analysis have the
          potential to elucidate disease etiology, identify therapeutic targets,
          and facilitate drug repurposing for various conditions. However,
          traditional methods do not effectively capture gene interactions,
          leading to limited insights into the mechanisms governing these
          traits. PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps gene
          expression patterns in relevant cell types onto a common latent
          representation based on modules of genes with similar patterns across
          different conditions. The study demonstrates its effectiveness by
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action, as well as prioritizing CRISPR screens for further
          investigation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework to
          contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          enabling new insights into therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          strategies missed by single-gene approaches.

          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation. By leveraging gene co-expression
          patterns across different conditions, we can elucidate how genes work
          together in concert to perform their functions. This understanding is
          crucial for developing new therapies that target complex traits'
          underlying mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify individual gene roles in disease-relevant pathways;
          however, modern models predict that genetic interactions play a
          significant role in the origin and progression of diseases.


          PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across similar
          conditions associated with specific complex traits, such as diseases.
          We demonstrate that these module-based associations are significantly
          related to known drug-disease pairs and can accurately infer
          mechanisms of action for existing therapies. Moreover, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules lack associations but
          remain prioritized by PhenoPLIER.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through the
          lens of gene co-expression patterns and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies for drug repurposing. Our approach
          offers a novel framework to interpret complex genetic traits and
          disease etiology by identifying functional modules with shared
          expression characteristics in diverse cellular contexts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational method
          for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis.
          To effectively identify the complex disease etiology by understanding
          the functions of genes acting in concert with each other under
          specific conditions, our approach requires a mechanistic understanding
          of expression regulation across different contexts. PhenoPLIER's key
          feature is its module-based gene representation based on similar
          expression patterns across relevant cell types and disease states. We
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these
          modules and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs by inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players in
          trait-associated genes were prioritized but lacked associations,
          indicating their potential as therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules and contextualizes complex traits by incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes. This research fills an essential gap in
          understanding how gene co-expression patterns highlight disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby advancing the field of
          functional genomics and therapeutic targets discovery.

          Our novel computational method, PhenoPLIER, explores the intricate
          connections between gene expression and complex traits by projecting
          genetic associations onto a common latent representation. The idea is
          to uncover how genes interact with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their functions, which can provide crucial insights into
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We employ transcriptome-wide
          association studies (TWAS) as well as pharmacological perturbation
          data to generate gene co-expression patterns across different
          conditions. 


          By analyzing these co-expression modules, we have found that diseases
          are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER is highly accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms of
          action. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations also highlights potential therapeutic targets missed by
          traditional single-gene strategies.


          To validate our approach, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and observed that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules as
          predicted by PhenoPLIER. In summary, through the utilization of gene
          co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative tool for
          disease etiology exploration and drug repurposing, providing a novel
          perspective on genetic associations.

          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This method helps to
          determine how genes influence complex traits by understanding
          expression regulation across different conditions, emphasizing the
          importance of mechanistic insights for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered roles of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. 


          Using this approach, we observed significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. In a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. 


          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes with
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through gene modules provides a
          valuable tool for drug repurposing and understanding complex diseases.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collectively
          function together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          making it essential to understand the expression regulation across
          various conditions when determining how these genes influence complex
          traits. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have assisted in unveiling the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however,
          current models predicting architecture for complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
          progression. 


          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes
          with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We
          observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed within relevant cell types, as well as accurate predictions
          for known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action using
          PhenoPLIER. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally essential players are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach but lack
          associations. 


          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through the
          use of PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework provided by PhenoPLIER interprets genetic associations
          through gene module analysis, offering a comprehensive understanding
          of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping
          genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation to explore disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms in complex traits. By considering gene co-expression
          patterns across different conditions, we provide a mechanistic
          understanding of how genes influence these traits. This approach is
          crucial for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shown that individual genes play a role in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions are key to complex trait origins and
          progression.


          PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions for each disease-trait
          pair. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases
          and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as
          accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs based on these
          modules. Additionally, we identified functionally important players
          lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules using
          a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by
          incorporating gene co-expression patterns and provides potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach offers novel
          insights into the mechanisms of complex traits and highlights
          therapeutic opportunities through repurposing drugs. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER presents a valuable framework for interpreting genetic
          studies in functional genomics and drug discovery research.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In this study, we fill a gap in the literature by introducing
          PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait

          interpreting complex traits. By incorporating these insights into drug
          repurposing and development, we move the broader field forward by
          expanding therapeutic possibilities and elucidating disease etiology.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. This method
          enables an understanding of the complex interplay between genes in
          specific contexts and their roles in influencing complex traits by
          determining how these genes regulate expression across different
          conditions. Integrating transcriptome-wide association studies with
          modern models of architecture has shown that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes sharing
          similar patterns across the same conditions, which we observe are
          significantly associated with diseases present in relevant cell types.
          Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR screening for
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
          into genetic associations with PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
          for interpreting complex traits and uncovers potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This study highlights the importance of
          understanding gene module functions to elucidate disease etiology and
          discover new therapeutic mechanisms, ultimately moving this field
          forward.

          Genes function in concert to perform their functions, requiring a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions for determining complex trait influence. Our
          study demonstrates that disease associations with specific gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types can be accurately predicted
          using known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through the analysis of lipid regulation by a CRISPR
          screen, we find that functionally important players are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER while lacking
          associations. In conclusion, incorporating gene co-expression patterns
          helps contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
          novel framework for interpreting these relationships through the lens
          of gene modules.

          Context: Complex traits are influenced by the cooperative action of
          genes in specific contexts, highlighting the importance of mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies.


          Content (Here we): To address this challenge, our study employs
          PhenoPLIER – a novel approach that identifies co-expressed gene
          modules and projects genetic associations through their patterns of
          expression. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action, as well as
          identifying functionally important players in trait-associated modules
          using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.


          Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules and offers valuable
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately
          advancing our understanding in the field of functional genomics and
          facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

          The study aims to address the gap in understanding how genes function
          together in specific contexts and their influence on complex traits.
          To achieve this, it requires a mechanistic insight into gene
          expression regulation across various conditions. The research
          highlights that such insights are essential for developing new
          therapies, as evidenced by our findings demonstrating significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types using a novel approach. Our method accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while the
          CRISPR screen identifies functionally important players prioritized in
          trait-associated modules but lacking associations. In conclusion,
          integrating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER allows for
          contextualizing genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a
          valuable tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate to execute their functions, with intricate interplay
          between co-expressed genes driving complex traits. To decipher the
          underlying mechanisms of gene expression regulation in diverse
          contexts, it is crucial to elucidate how these genes contribute to
          disease etiology and drug efficacy. Our research demonstrates that
          diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed
          within relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and providing mechanistic insights into therapeutic targets.
          Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
          reveal the functional importance of key players missing associations
          but prioritized in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER. This
          approach contextualizes genetic associations, identifying potential
          missed targets using groups of co-expressed genes. Our findings
          showcase a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          drug mechanisms, providing valuable insights into gene module analysis
          for future therapeutic strategies.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Context: Genetic studies have shed light on complex traits, but
          functional genomics requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across diverse conditions. The connection
          between these genes and developing new therapies has been established,
          highlighting the importance of elucidating their influence on complex
          traits (e.g., drug repurposing).


          Content: Our study proposes an innovative method called PhenoPLIER to
          address this gap in literature by projecting genetic associations
          through gene expression patterns. This approach highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring the functional roles of genes involved in complex traits. We
          validate our findings using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          showing that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules despite lacking associations.


          Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER as an
          invaluable tool to interpret genetic associations by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes. This novel framework enables
          contextualizing complex traits and uncovers potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, advancing our understanding
          of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in functional genomics
          research.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions, and understanding gene
          expression regulation is crucial for unraveling complex traits. Recent
          studies have demonstrated the importance of this insight in developing
          novel therapies. In this study, we uncover significant associations
          between diseases and distinct gene modules expressed across relevant
          cell types using a co-expression approach, accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidating their mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, our CRISPR screen on lipid regulation reveals
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the
          potential for missed targets identified through single-gene strategies
          using co-expressed groups. Overall, this novel approach contextualizes
          genetic associations and provides a framework for interpreting complex
          traits via gene module analysis, offering valuable insights into
          therapeutic development.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          This research aimed to address the gap in functional genomics by
          investigating gene co-expression patterns for disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. To achieve this, we utilized a novel approach called
          PhenoPLIER, which clusters complex traits based on gene expression
          across different cell types. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs
          and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening
          for lipid regulation analysis, we found that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the
          potential of incorporating gene co-expression patterns through
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal drug
          repurposing opportunities missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations provides a valuable
          tool for understanding complex traits and developing new therapies
          within the broader context of functional genomics.

          Genetic studies have revealed the importance of gene co-expression in
          complex traits, highlighting their potential role in drug mechanisms
          and therapeutic targets. However, a comprehensive understanding of
          these relationships remains elusive due to limited data on functional
          genomics. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By analyzing gene modules with similar expression
          patterns across relevant cell types, our study identifies significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules, accurately predicting
          known drug-disease pairs, and elucidating mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we discovered that functionally important players in
          lipid regulation lack associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen. These findings not
          only deepen our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          but also pave the way for novel therapeutic targets through gene
          expression pattern projections.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes function in concert with one another to perform their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic examination of expression regulation across
          diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel
          therapies, as transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the
          role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role
          in the origin and progression of diseases.


          To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This methodology is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions, revealing significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          In addition to this, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, identifying functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this

          In the context of functional genomics, complex traits like diseases
          and their associated mechanisms have long been a challenge to
          decipher. Traditional gene-based approaches are limited in their
          ability to elucidate gene interactions involved in these conditions,
          leaving critical insights on potential therapeutic targets unexplored
          (keyword: 'gene co-expression'). However, recent advances in
          transcriptome-wide association studies provide promising prospects for
          uncovering individual genes' role in disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in complex trait origins and progression (keyword: 'disease etiology',
          'drug mechanisms'). 


          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER—a novel computational method leveraging
          transcriptomic data to map gene associations with traits into shared
          latent representations. This approach utilizes modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          which allows for a more comprehensive understanding of
          disease-associated gene networks and pharmacological perturbations
          (keyword: 'drug repurposing'). By analyzing existing drug-disease
          pairs and identifying mechanisms of action, PhenoPLIER significantly
          improves our ability to predict new therapeutic targets.


          In further validation through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we
          find that key players in trait-associated modules are prioritized even
          though they lack associations themselves (keyword: 'functional
          genomics'). Thus, the integration of gene co-expression and drug
          perturbation data via PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on potential
          therapeutic targets but also elucidates the mechanisms underlying
          complex traits.

          Genes work together to perform their functions, and understanding how
          they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic examination of
          expression regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped identify the roles of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and progression.


          PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach introduced to map
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, providing insight into genetic
          interactions that underlie complex traits. Our study demonstrates
          significant disease association with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and accurate predictions of known drug-disease
          pairs as well as mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          identify functionally important players lacking associations but
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
          findings highlight the utility of this approach for identifying
          therapeutic targets in disease etiology and drug repurposing.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The genetic study of complex traits has long sought to elucidate the
          mechanistic underpinnings that govern gene expression and influence
          disease etiology. Despite substantial advances in transcriptome-wide
          association studies, there remains a critical gap in our understanding
          regarding how gene interactions contribute to disease origin and
          progression. Consequently, developing novel therapeutic strategies
          continues to be hampered by this knowledge deficit.


          Our work introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges
          the gap between genetic associations and drug repurposing. By mapping
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across relevant conditions, we reveal disease
          relationships in distinct modules of co-expressed genes. Our results
          indicate significant association of these gene modules with specific
          diseases, demonstrating our ability to accurately predict known
          drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, through the use of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          we demonstrate that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct
          associations. These findings not only shed light on new therapeutic
          targets but also underscore the power of our approach in advancing
          functional genomics and drug repurposing. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's
          ability to project gene expression patterns across complex traits
          highlights critical disease etiology and facilitates novel drug
          mechanisms, underscoring its potential impact on future research in
          this field.

          Genes function in concert with each other to perform their functions,

          across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          unveiled the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, yet

          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we
          discover that functionally crucial players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          gene expression patterns is crucial for determining complex trait
          etiology. This knowledge has significant implications in drug
          repurposing by identifying novel therapeutic targets (keywords:
          "genetic associations", "gene co-expression"). However, existing
          transcriptome-wide association studies predominantly focus on
          individual genes, ignoring the critical role of gene interactions in
          disease origin and progression. 


          To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (keywords:
          "PhenoPLIER", "modules"). Our method identifies gene modules with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing
          significant disease association in these modules. Moreover, our
          findings accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and uncover
          mechanisms of action (keywords: "accuracy", "CRISPR screen"). 


          In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to understanding
          complex traits by leveraging gene co-expression patterns, thereby
          enhancing the discovery of therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in concert, and
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions.
          This insight is essential for developing novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in
          disease origin and progression. 


          PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational method, maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which reveal significant associations between diseases and
          specific cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. 


          Furthermore, utilizing CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Recent advancements in genomics have revealed that genes act in
          concert with each other to perform their functions, which underscores
          the need for a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing
          new therapies and transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By analyzing the
          expression patterns of genes across relevant cell types, our study
          highlights significant associations between diseases and gene modules.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action, paving the way for drug repurposing.

              Gene co-expression plays a crucial role in determining complex
              traits, as individual genes function together to perform their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions is essential for developing
              new therapies, as it aids in uncovering the roles of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms via transcriptome-wide association
              studies. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are key drivers of complex traits and disease
              progression.


              To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This model is based on modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, enabling us to identify significant relationships
              between diseases and specific cell types as well as accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.


              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER even if they lack
              associations themselves. In conclusion, integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes through the use of PhenoPLIER can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for
              interpreting complex traits via gene modules.

              Genes interact with one another to perform their functions,
              working in concert for complex traits. A mechanistic understanding
              of gene expression regulation is crucial for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              identify the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in disease origin and progression.


              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach aimed at mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant
              conditions, PhenoPLIER highlights the association between diseases
              and these gene modules. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


              By utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              The study of complex traits and diseases necessitates a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Complex traits result from the coordinated actions of multiple
              genes, emphasizing the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation for disease etiology and therapy development. However,
              current methods fail to account for genetic interactions in
              complex trait analysis (Zhang et al., 2018). This study fills this
              gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach mapping

              cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate in concert with each other to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic approach that considers expression
              regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression.


              PhenoPLIER is a computational method for mapping gene-trait
              associations into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. It does so by integrating modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating that PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action.


              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated gene modules. In

              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for

              In the context of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              identifying gene co-expression patterns is crucial for
              understanding complex traits and disease etiology. However,
              current methods struggle to capture the full complexity of gene
              interactions involved in these processes. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER – a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By using
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, PhenoPLIER successfully identifies significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types while accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by
              uncovering functional players missing from lipid regulation that
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen.
              In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes with
              PhenoPLIER enables contextualizing genetic associations and
              revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              novel framework provides valuable insights into the molecular
              mechanisms underlying complex traits and can be leveraged for drug
              repurposing efforts, ultimately advancing our understanding of
              human diseases and their treatment options.

              The study fills an important gap in our understanding of complex
              diseases by projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns. Functional genomics and co-expression
              analysis have the potential to elucidate disease etiology,
              identify therapeutic targets, and facilitate drug repurposing for
              various conditions. However, traditional methods do not
              effectively capture gene interactions, leading to limited insights
              into the mechanisms governing these traits. PhenoPLIER is a novel
              computational approach that maps gene expression patterns in
              relevant cell types onto a common latent representation based on
              modules of genes with similar patterns across different
              conditions. The study demonstrates its effectiveness by predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as
              well as prioritizing CRISPR screens for further investigation.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework to
              contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, enabling new insights into therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing strategies missed by single-gene approaches.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation. By leveraging gene co-expression
              patterns across different conditions, we can elucidate how genes
              work together in concert to perform their functions. This
              understanding is crucial for developing new therapies that target
              complex traits' underlying mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in
              disease-relevant pathways; however, modern models predict that
              genetic interactions play a significant role in the origin and
              progression of diseases.


              PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across similar
              conditions associated with specific complex traits, such as
              diseases. We demonstrate that these module-based associations are
              significantly related to known drug-disease pairs and can
              accurately infer mechanisms of action for existing therapies.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules lack associations but remain prioritized by PhenoPLIER.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through
              the lens of gene co-expression patterns and reveals potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies for drug repurposing. Our
              approach offers a novel framework to interpret complex genetic
              traits and disease etiology by identifying functional modules with
              shared expression characteristics in diverse cellular contexts.

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational
              method for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for
              joint analysis. To effectively identify the complex disease
              etiology by understanding the functions of genes acting in concert
              with each other under specific conditions, our approach requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different contexts. PhenoPLIER's key feature is its module-based
              gene representation based on similar expression patterns across
              relevant cell types and disease states. We demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with these modules and
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs by inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
              players in trait-associated genes were prioritized but lacked

              Our novel computational method, PhenoPLIER, explores the intricate
              connections between gene expression and complex traits by
              projecting genetic associations onto a common latent
              representation. The idea is to uncover how genes interact with
              each other in specific contexts to perform their functions, which
              can provide crucial insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. We employ transcriptome-wide association studies
              (TWAS) as well as pharmacological perturbation data to generate
              gene co-expression patterns across different conditions. 


              By analyzing these co-expression modules, we have found that
              diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER is
              highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring their mechanisms of action. This innovative framework
              for interpreting genetic associations also highlights potential
              therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies.


              To validate our approach, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and observed that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules as
              predicted by PhenoPLIER. In summary, through the utilization of
              gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative tool
              for disease etiology exploration and drug repurposing, providing a
              novel perspective on genetic associations.

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This method helps to
              determine how genes influence complex traits by understanding
              expression regulation across different conditions, emphasizing the
              importance of mechanistic insights for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered roles of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. 


              Using this approach, we observed significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
              modules. 


              In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes with
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
              modules provides a valuable tool for drug repurposing and

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes
              collectively function together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, making it essential to understand the expression
              regulation across various conditions when determining how these
              genes influence complex traits. This insight is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have assisted in unveiling the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms; however, current models predicting
              architecture for complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
              progression. 


              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes with similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed within relevant cell types, as well as
              accurate predictions for known drug-disease pairs and inferred
              mechanisms of action using PhenoPLIER. Furthermore, employing a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally essential players are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by our approach but lack associations. 


              In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through
              the use of PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              unveil potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER interprets genetic
              associations through gene module analysis, offering a
              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
              common latent representation to explore disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms in complex traits. By considering gene co-expression
              patterns across different conditions, we provide a mechanistic
              understanding of how genes influence these traits. This approach
              is crucial for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shown that individual genes play a role
              in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions are key to complex trait origins and
              progression.


              PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions for each
              disease-trait pair. Our findings reveal significant associations
              between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease
              pairs based on these modules. Additionally, we identified
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by
              incorporating gene co-expression patterns and provides potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach offers
              novel insights into the mechanisms of complex traits and
              highlights therapeutic opportunities through repurposing drugs.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER presents a valuable framework for interpreting
              genetic studies in functional genomics and drug discovery
              research.

              In this study, we fill a gap in the literature by introducing
              PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. By determining how genes
              act together to perform their functions, our method requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. We highlight that this insight is essential
              for developing new therapies by utilizing transcriptome-wide
              association studies (TWAS). However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Our
              approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. 


              We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the
              accuracy of PhenoPLIER's prediction for known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. 


              In conclusion, our approach contextualizes genetic associations
              through co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential targets
              missed in single-gene strategies and providing a novel framework
              for interpreting complex traits. By incorporating these insights
              into drug repurposing and development, we move the broader field
              forward by expanding therapeutic possibilities and elucidating
              disease etiology.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for
              mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation. By identifying groups of
              co-expressed genes that work together in specific contexts to
              perform their functions, we can gain insights into how these genes
              influence complex traits and uncover potential therapeutic
              targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shown the
              role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease etiology and progression. 


              PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes with similar
              expression patterns across relevant conditions, which are
              significantly associated with diseases. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action
              by contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules. For
              instance, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              found that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. 


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations and identifying potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal mechanisms underlying complex traits.

              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes sharing
              similar patterns across the same conditions, which we observe are
              significantly associated with diseases present in relevant cell
              types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR
              screening for lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic
              associations with PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting complex traits and uncovers potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies. This study highlights the importance of
              understanding gene module functions to elucidate disease etiology
              and discover new therapeutic mechanisms, ultimately moving this
              field forward.

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

              Genes work together to perform their functions, and understanding

              Genes function in concert to perform their functions, requiring a

              Context: Complex traits are influenced by the cooperative action
              of genes in specific contexts, highlighting the importance of
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across

              Content (Here we): To address this challenge, our study employs
              PhenoPLIER – a novel approach that identifies co-expressed gene
              modules and projects genetic associations through their patterns
              of expression. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action, as well
              as identifying functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.


              Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER can contextualize
              genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This approach provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
              and offers valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, ultimately advancing our understanding in the field of
              functional genomics and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

              Genes collaborate in unison to perform their functions, requiring
              a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different contexts for determining complex trait influences. This
              insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. In this study,
              we demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs, as well as infer mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation
              revealed functionally important players to lack associations but
              are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes using
              PhenoPLIER offers a contextual approach for interpreting genetic
              associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets missed
              through single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides an
              innovative perspective on the interpretation of genetic
              associations via gene module analysis.

              The study aims to address the gap in understanding how genes
              function together in specific contexts and their influence on
              complex traits. To achieve this, it requires a mechanistic insight
              into gene expression regulation across various conditions. The
              research highlights that such insights are essential for
              developing new therapies, as evidenced by our findings
              demonstrating significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types using a novel approach.
              Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action, while the CRISPR screen identifies
              functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated
              modules but lacking associations. In conclusion, integrating

              Genes collaborate to execute their functions, with intricate
              interplay between co-expressed genes driving complex traits. To
              decipher the underlying mechanisms of gene expression regulation
              in diverse contexts, it is crucial to elucidate how these genes
              contribute to disease etiology and drug efficacy. Our research
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to specific
              gene modules expressed within relevant cell types, accurately
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and providing mechanistic
              insights into therapeutic targets. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR
              screen to study lipid regulation, we reveal the functional
              importance of key players missing associations but prioritized in
              trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER. This approach
              contextualizes genetic associations, identifying potential missed

              Context: Genetic studies have shed light on complex traits, but
              functional genomics requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across diverse conditions. The connection
              between these genes and developing new therapies has been
              established, highlighting the importance of elucidating their
              influence on complex traits (e.g., drug repurposing).


              Content: Our study proposes an innovative method called PhenoPLIER
              to address this gap in literature by projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns. This approach
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring the functional roles of genes
              involved in complex traits. We validate our findings using a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, showing that functionally
              important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              despite lacking associations.


              Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER as an
              invaluable tool to interpret genetic associations by incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes. This novel framework enables
              contextualizing complex traits and uncovers potential therapeutic
              targets missed by single-gene strategies, advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in
              functional genomics research.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions, and understanding
              gene expression regulation is crucial for unraveling complex
              traits. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of this
              insight in developing novel therapies. In this study, we uncover
              significant associations between diseases and distinct gene
              modules expressed across relevant cell types using a co-expression
              approach, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidating their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR
              screen on lipid regulation reveals functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated gene
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential for missed
              targets identified through single-gene strategies using
              co-expressed groups. Overall, this novel approach contextualizes
              genetic associations and provides a framework for interpreting
              complex traits via gene module analysis, offering valuable
              insights into therapeutic development.

              This research aimed to address the gap in functional genomics by
              investigating gene co-expression patterns for disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. To achieve this, we utilized a novel approach
              called PhenoPLIER, which clusters complex traits based on gene
              expression across different cell types. Our findings reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation analysis, we found
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of incorporating
              gene co-expression patterns through PhenoPLIER to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal drug repurposing opportunities
              missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations provides a valuable tool for
              understanding complex traits and developing new therapies within
              the broader context of functional genomics.

              Genes work together in groups to perform their functions. To
              understand how these genes influence complex traits, we need a
              better understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              identify the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms;
              however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in disease etiology and progression.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, highlighting their
              potential therapeutic relevance. We observed that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, demonstrating our approach's accuracy in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              Genes function in concert with one another to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic examination of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for
              developing novel therapies, as transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a critical role in the origin and
              progression of diseases.


              To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our
              method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action.


              In addition to this, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, identifying functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules

              In the context of functional genomics, complex traits like
              diseases and their associated mechanisms have long been a
              challenge to decipher. Traditional gene-based approaches are
              limited in their ability to elucidate gene interactions involved
              in these conditions, leaving critical insights on potential
              therapeutic targets unexplored (keyword: 'gene co-expression').
              However, recent advances in transcriptome-wide association studies
              provide promising prospects for uncovering individual genes' role
              in disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait
              origins and progression (keyword: 'disease etiology', 'drug
              mechanisms'). 


              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER—a novel computational method
              leveraging transcriptomic data to map gene associations with
              traits into shared latent representations. This approach utilizes
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions, which allows for a more comprehensive
              understanding of disease-associated gene networks and
              pharmacological perturbations (keyword: 'drug repurposing'). By
              analyzing existing drug-disease pairs and identifying mechanisms
              of action, PhenoPLIER significantly improves our ability to
              predict new therapeutic targets.


              In further validation through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation,
              we find that key players in trait-associated modules are
              prioritized even though they lack associations themselves
              (keyword: 'functional genomics'). Thus, the integration of gene
              co-expression and drug perturbation data via PhenoPLIER not only
              sheds light on potential therapeutic targets but also elucidates
              the mechanisms underlying complex traits.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes work together to perform their functions, and understanding

              The genetic study of complex traits has long sought to elucidate
              the mechanistic underpinnings that govern gene expression and
              influence disease etiology. Despite substantial advances in
              transcriptome-wide association studies, there remains a critical
              gap in our understanding regarding how gene interactions
              contribute to disease origin and progression. Consequently,
              developing novel therapeutic strategies continues to be hampered
              by this knowledge deficit.


              Our work introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              bridges the gap between genetic associations and drug repurposing.
              By mapping gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant
              conditions, we reveal disease relationships in distinct modules of
              co-expressed genes. Our results indicate significant association
              of these gene modules with specific diseases, demonstrating our
              ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
              mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, through the use of a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important players are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite
              lacking direct associations. These findings not only shed light on
              new therapeutic targets but also underscore the power of our
              approach in advancing functional genomics and drug repurposing. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to project gene expression
              patterns across complex traits highlights critical disease
              etiology and facilitates novel drug mechanisms, underscoring its

              Genes function in concert with each other to perform their
              functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have unveiled the roles of individual genes in
              disease mechanisms, yet modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play an essential part in complex trait etiology and
              progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to
              map gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on
              modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions, we identify disease associations with these
              modules and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs as well as
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen focusing on
              lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial players
              lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for determining
              complex trait etiology. This knowledge has significant
              implications in drug repurposing by identifying novel therapeutic
              targets (keywords: "genetic associations", "gene co-expression").
              However, existing transcriptome-wide association studies
              predominantly focus on individual genes, ignoring the critical
              role of gene interactions in disease origin and progression. 


              To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis (keywords: "PhenoPLIER", "modules"). Our method
              identifies gene modules with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, revealing significant disease association in
              these modules. Moreover, our findings accurately predict known
              drug-disease pairs and uncover mechanisms of action (keywords:
              "accuracy", "CRISPR screen"). 


              In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to understanding
              complex traits by leveraging gene co-expression patterns, thereby
              enhancing the discovery of therapeutic targets for drug
              repurposing.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
