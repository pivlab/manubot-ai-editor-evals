Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " Genes work in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enhances PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes operate in concert with each other within specific contexts to carry out their functions. To understand how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is crucial to gain insight into the regulation of expression across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new therapies. Previous studies using transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. Introducing PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach, we integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we observed that functionally important players may not have direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our approach allows for contextualizing genetic associations and reveals potential targets often missed in single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes work together to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires an investigation into expression regulation across different conditions. These insights are vital for developing new therapies, as gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits predict that such associations may be insufficient to explain all aspects of these diseases. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that connects gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our results show that diseases are closely linked to the expression patterns of relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players without direct genetic associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework aids in contextualizing genetic associations by examining co-expression patterns among groups of genes, potentially identifying overlooked therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches and uncovering connections between disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": " Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how they impact complex traits requires investigating the regulation of gene expression across diverse conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches. Current methods such as transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes associated with disease mechanisms; however, these do not fully capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions contributing to diseases. To address this limitation, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions, our method shows disease relevance to these gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, elucidate mechanisms of action, and prioritize functionally relevant players that lack traditional associations but are crucial within trait-associated modules. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules provides a novel perspective on contextualizing genetic connections in the broader landscape of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes function together in specific contexts to perform their tasks. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates understanding gene expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing new therapies, as it reveals mechanisms associated with diseases. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach leveraging gene expression patterns across conditions to map genetic associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and identify drug-disease relationships through a shared latent representation. By analyzing known and predicted drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action, PhenoPLIER is shown to be more accurate than single-gene strategies in revealing potential drug targets missed by traditional approaches. In conclusion, incorporating co-expression gene modules enhances PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations and shed light on previously overlooked drug mechanisms or targets. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating an understanding of the regulation of expression across various conditions to decipher how they influence complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression.

In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups into our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potentially overlooked targets uncovered by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, the impact of these gene interactions on complex traits can be elucidated. This knowledge is crucial for advancing therapeutic development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have highlighted the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the origin and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions; we observe that diseases are significantly associated with these relevant cell types' gene modules. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, uncovers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes essential players in trait-associated modules via a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. PhenoPLIER thus contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets that might be missed using single-gene approaches. In this way, our framework offers a novel perspective on interpreting genetic associations through gene expression modules' lenses."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Recognizing the collaborative nature of genes in performing their functions, we emphasize the importance of comprehending their regulatory mechanisms across distinct conditions to elucidate the influence on complex traits. This understanding is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions substantially contribute to the origins and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation utilizes modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions; we observe that these gene modules are significantly related to specific diseases expressed in relevant cell types. This approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations, elucidates the mechanisms of action for these drugs, and highlights the importance of functionally significant players often overlooked in single-gene studies but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets that might otherwise be missed through traditional single-gene approaches, thus providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene module representations."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression analysis, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits are all important aspects of this broader field.

Deciphering how these genes impact complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. Our findings in this study demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while unraveling their mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally crucial players lacked associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

We further explored lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, revealing that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and shed light on potential targets previously missed through single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in the wider perspective of gene expression patterns."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. Our study has demonstrated that diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screen for analyzing lipid regulation, it was found that functionally important players without associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

To elucidate the influence of such genes on these traits, it is crucial to have an insight into expression regulation across different contexts. Our research findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach shows high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease connections while also inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nBy conducting a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation, we observed the absence of direct associations for some key players but prioritized these genes in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER. This method demonstrates how contextualizing genetic associations using groups of co-expressed genes can help reveal missed potential targets usually overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for analyzing and interpreting genetic associations, with gene modules as the basis for deeper understanding."

Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A deeper understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for revealing mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into individual genes' roles in disease-related processes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are central to the emergence and progression of diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates genetic associations and pharmacological data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation utilizes modules containing genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to examine the association between diseases and gene expressions in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action, and can even prioritize functionally important players that lack direct associations but are associated with trait-related modules. This approach also highlights the importance of leveraging gene expression patterns for understanding disease etiology and drug development."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining insight into this regulation across different conditions is crucial for understanding disease etiology and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it has become evident that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of various diseases. In an effort to address this limitation, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules composed of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings showcase that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers their mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players may lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our approach. Overall, PhenoPLIER helps bridge the gap between genetic studies, functional genomics, and therapeutic targets while elucidating disease mechanisms and drug repurposing strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

In response, this study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach leveraging common latent representations to analyze gene modules and their associations with pharmacological perturbations for disease-related mechanisms.

          "output": " Genes work together to perform their functions, and understanding the intricacies of gene expression regulation across various contexts is crucial for unraveling complex traits. This knowledge is vital in developing effective treatments, as it reveals mechanisms related to diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly by revealing individual genes' roles in disease processes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in shaping the etiology of complex traits. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action. In addition, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, this method aims to provide valuable insight into the genetic underpinnings and potential therapies for complex traits, particularly in understanding how genes work together to influence disease development and progression."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of diseases. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and unravels their mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking direct associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

          "output": " Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding the complex interplay of these genes is vital for unraveling how they influence intricate traits. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies aimed at treating diseases. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of diseases. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Through PhenoPLIER, we discover that diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, showcasing its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for analyzing lipid regulation, our study reveals that functionally essential players, which may lack direct associations with traits, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enhances PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

These insights are vital for developing new therapies, as gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits predict that such associations may be insufficient to explain all aspects of these diseases. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that connects gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our results show that diseases are closely linked to the expression patterns of relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players without direct genetic associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework aids in contextualizing genetic associations by examining co-expression patterns among groups of genes, potentially identifying overlooked therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches and uncovering connections between disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches. Current methods such as transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes associated with disease mechanisms; however, these do not fully capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions contributing to diseases. To address this limitation, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions, our method shows disease relevance to these gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, elucidate mechanisms of action, and prioritize functionally relevant players that lack traditional associations but are crucial within trait-associated modules. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules provides a novel perspective on contextualizing genetic connections in the broader landscape of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding gene regulation across different conditions is vital for uncovering the mechanisms behind disease etiology and drug repurposing. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' roles, modern models predict that gene interactions contribute significantly to disease origins and progression. To address this issue, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and modules of co-expressed genes into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. We demonstrate that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts drug-disease connections and mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe functional players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups enhances the interpretation of genetic associations through a novel framework, improving single-gene strategies and drug target identification by better understanding disease etiology.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

To better understand how genes influence complex traits, we need insight into their regulation across different conditions and cell types. This knowledge is crucial for developing effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, gene-gene interactions are thought to play a significant role in the development of diseases. Existing models predict that these interactions contribute to disease origins and progressions. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. We find that our approach accurately predicts drug-disease associations, inferred mechanisms of action, and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes act in concert to influence complex traits, necessitating understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on single genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models highlight the significance of gene-gene interactions in complex trait architecture. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of co-expressed genes and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed important players without single-gene associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify overlooked targets not found through single-gene approaches. In conclusion, the proposed framework offers a valuable approach to interpreting genetic associations by considering gene modules' influence on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Recognizing the collaborative nature of genes in performing their functions, we emphasize the importance of comprehending their regulatory mechanisms across distinct conditions to elucidate the influence on complex traits. This understanding is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions substantially contribute to the origins and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation utilizes modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions; we observe that these gene modules are significantly related to specific diseases expressed in relevant cell types. This approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations, elucidates the mechanisms of action for these drugs, and highlights the importance of functionally significant players often overlooked in single-gene studies but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets that might otherwise be missed through traditional single-gene approaches, thus providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene module representations.",

Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression analysis, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits are all important aspects of this broader field.

To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for joint analysis. This new approach allows us to determine how genes affect complex traits through their regulatory roles in various conditions. The content section highlights our findings: PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, reveal mechanisms of action, and identify functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. Our study has demonstrated that diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screen for analyzing lipid regulation, it was found that functionally important players without associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of these processes is crucial for advancing drug development. In this study, we show that genetic associations are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and revealing the mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that players lacking direct associations but present in trait-associated groups were prioritized using PhenoPLIER. Our conclusion demonstrates how PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by integrating co-expressed genes and sheds light on potential targets missed with single-gene approaches, offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. In response, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and common latent representations for joint analysis based on gene expression patterns across conditions and cell types. We show the accuracy of predicting drug-disease pairs and mechanisms through this approach. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This insight is vital for developing new therapies targeting gene-gene interactions in disease development and progression. Previous methods focus on individual genes, while modern models predict that gene-trait associations are critical to uncover the full scope of complex traits. In response, this study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach leveraging common latent representations to analyze gene modules and their associations with pharmacological perturbations for disease-related mechanisms. Using CRISPR screens, we observe that functionally relevant genes are prioritized by the PhenoPLIER method due to its consideration of broader cellular contexts, providing a more comprehensive approach to therapeutic development and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is vital for developing new therapies targeting diseases. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern theories suggest that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, an approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into one common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. This approach utilizes gene expression modules based on similar patterns across shared conditions, revealing significant connections between diseases and gene expression in relevant cell types. Additionally, it accurately predicts drug-disease pairs and suggests mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential players without direct associations are still prioritized within trait-associated modules due to PhenoPLIER's focus on understanding gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding gene regulation across different conditions is crucial for uncovering disease mechanisms and developing new treatments. However, many models suggest that gene-gene interactions are important in the origin of diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that connects genetic associations to gene expression patterns and drug responses by analyzing modules with similar gene expression across conditions. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies key mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screen, we observed that functionally important players were not associated but prioritized in trait-associated gene modules. Thus, PhenoPLIER helps advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, bridging the gap between complex traits and gene interactions.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Unraveling this influence requires understanding gene expression regulation in different contexts for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies help understand individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent representation to analyze them together. This representation uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions and can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes important players not associated with traits but present in trait-associated modules, highlighting the importance of its approach in disease research.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."
