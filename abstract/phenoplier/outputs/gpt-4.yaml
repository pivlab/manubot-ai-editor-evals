          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on

          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that

          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This

          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal.
          However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these
          interactions and their implications for disease mechanisms and drug
          development. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. This method advances our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the
          broader field of genetic studies and drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these
          interactions and their regulation across different conditions. To
          address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
          important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement in
          genetic studies could significantly enhance our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and

          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
          functionally significant genes, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, provides
          a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations, offering
          insights into potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, necessitating a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying
          conditions to understand their influence on complex traits. This
          understanding is pivotal for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to
          disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked
          to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals
          that functionally significant genes, though lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, provides
          a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations, offering
          insights into potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

          regulation showed that functionally important players, although

          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in disease
          progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, and advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is vital for the development of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
          functionally significant genes, though lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, provides
          a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations, offering
          insights into potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
          functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

          regulation showed that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in disease
          progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial
          for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the
          context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses
          this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We introduce a
          novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results,
          including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
          functionally important players, often overlooked in single-gene
          strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          This approach has broader implications for the field, as it can reveal
          potential therapeutic targets and aid in drug repurposing.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This study addresses this gap by examining the significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
          collectively influence complex traits across different conditions is
          crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly
          in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study
          addresses this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We
          introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results,
          including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
          functionally important players, often overlooked by single-gene
          strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach
          has broader significance as it can potentially enhance drug
          repurposing efforts and improve the clustering of complex traits.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates
          that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates
          that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, contextualizing them, and uncovering potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
          collectively influence complex traits across different conditions is
          crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly
          in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study
          addresses this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We
          introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results,
          including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
          functionally important players, although lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
          suggests that PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore,
          PhenoPLIER not only provides a new framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through gene modules but also advances the broader field
          of functional genomics by highlighting potential avenues for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression, a facet not fully explored in existing literature. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
          comprehensive analysis. This representation is predicated on modules
          of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important
          players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the
          potential of PhenoPLIER in elucidating complex gene interactions,
          thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, and paving the way for potential therapeutic targets and
          drug repurposing.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are integral to the onset and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          critical in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          While genes operate synergistically in specific contexts to execute
          their functions, understanding their influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to
          disease onset and progression. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Further validation using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation demonstrated that
          functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not
          only enhances our understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology but also provides a novel approach for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide association
          studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
          origin and progression, a facet not fully explored. This gap in
          knowledge hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          demonstrated that functionally important genes, although lacking
          direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene
          interactions in disease progression but also highlight the potential
          of PhenoPLIER in advancing our understanding of disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms, thereby paving the way for therapeutic target
          identification and drug repurposing.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are vital in the onset and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The complex interplay of genes and their role in disease etiology and
          progression is a critical area of study, yet our understanding of
          gene-gene interactions and their influence on complex traits remains
          incomplete. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of new
          therapies, despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies
          that have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes, though
          lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This research not only fills a critical gap in
          understanding gene-gene interactions in disease progression but also
          provides a robust tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets
          and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the field of
          functional genomics.

            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered

              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the perspective of gene modules.

              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in
              the context of disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to
              effectively map these interactions and their implications for
              disease mechanisms and drug development. To address this, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally important players, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to
              interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              method advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of genetic
              studies and drug repurposing.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease onset and progression. However, a gap exists in our

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              vital in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant genes, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations,
              offering insights into potential targets overlooked by single-gene

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their regulation across different
              conditions. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
              reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation showed that
              functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in
              disease progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for
              drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. Genes function synergistically within
              specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are critical in disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
              regulation, we discover that functionally significant players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
              clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic
              associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
              modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant genes, though lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations,
              offering insights into potential targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies.

              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their regulation across different
              conditions. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, thereby contextualizing genetic associations and
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This approach advances our understanding of the
              complex interplay of genes in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies and
              drug repurposing.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases have significant associations with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge
              is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic
              associations. It contextualizes these associations and uncovers
              potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              collectively influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in
              our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation,
              particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER,
              which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally important
              players, often overlooked by single-gene strategies, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
              highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This
              approach has broader significance as it can potentially enhance
              drug repurposing efforts and improve the clustering of complex
              traits.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge
              is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations,
              contextualizing them, and uncovering potential targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              collectively influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in
              our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation,
              particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER,
              which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally important
              players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore,
              PhenoPLIER not only provides a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through gene modules but also advances the
              broader field of functional genomics by highlighting potential
              avenues for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge
              is pivotal for the development of new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that interactions between genes are integral
              to the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease onset and progression, a facet not fully explored in
              existing literature. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent

              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This study not only enhances our understanding of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology but also provides a
              novel approach for identifying potential therapeutic targets and
              drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the field of
              genetic studies.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide
              association studies on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet not fully
              explored. This gap in knowledge hinders our ability to fully
              comprehend disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To address this,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes

              conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes,
              although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only
              answer the question of gene-gene interactions in disease
              progression but also highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in
              advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, thereby paving the way for therapeutic target
              identification and drug repurposing.

              The complex interplay of genes and their role in disease etiology
              and progression is a critical area of study, yet our understanding
              of gene-gene interactions and their influence on complex traits
              remains incomplete. This gap in knowledge hinders the development
              of new therapies, despite advances in transcriptome-wide
              association studies that have elucidated the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms. To address this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our
              findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              demonstrated that functionally important genes, though lacking
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. This research not only fills a critical gap in
              understanding gene-gene interactions in disease progression but
              also provides a robust tool for identifying potential therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the
              field of functional genomics.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
