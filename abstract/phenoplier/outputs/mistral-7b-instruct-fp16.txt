          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work in concert with each other to carry out their functions
          within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence
          complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for
          the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped reveal the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play an essential
          role in disease onset and progression. To address this challenge, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach

          regulation and find that functionally important players lack

          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
          into the analysis provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize
          these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have revolutionized the field
          of disease etiology, but they face a major challenge in understanding
          how genes interact with each other to contribute to complex traits.
          Gene co-expression has been shown to play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression, and recent advances in transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these
          approaches often neglect gene-gene interactions, which can obscure
          potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions and can contextualize genetic associations
          by considering groups of co-expressed genes. We demonstrate the
          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs,
          inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizing functionally
          important players that lack associations but are enriched in
          trait-associated modules. Our study provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which can aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          The coordinated action of genes is essential for their functional
          performance in specific contexts. Understanding the regulation of gene
          expression patterns across various conditions is critical in
          developing new therapies, especially for complex traits. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates

          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly

          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to

          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules and contextualizing them, thereby revealing potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The current understanding of complex traits, such as disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms, is limited by the assumption that individual
          genes play a significant role. However, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial in
          disease development and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. The method is based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the
          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action by using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation. Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER can provide a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, which highlights the importance of studying gene
          co-expression in complex trait etiology and drug discovery.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We
          argue that genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires an investigation of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Our previous research has demonstrated the importance of
          this insight for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. We propose PhenoPLIER's
          representation, which is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis reveals
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          demonstrate that functionally important players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER through a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER
          provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations by
          contextualizing gene expression patterns and revealing potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap
          between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          by mapping them into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. By understanding how genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions, we can gain insights
          into expression regulation across different conditions, which is
          critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. We show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          and find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, providing potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Our study highlights the importance of analyzing gene expression
          patterns to understand complex traits and disease mechanisms. By
          leveraging functional genomics and gene co-expression, we found that
          diseases are significantly associated with specific groups of genes
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is highly accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis revealed that
          functionally important players may not be associated with disease but
          can still be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          These results demonstrate the value of incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our
          study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The field of genetics has long known that genes act in concert with
          each other to perform their functions. However, determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. The accuracy and
          relevance of this understanding is critical for developing new
          therapies. In this study, we present a novel approach for projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns that highlights
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our approach
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our findings have broad significance for drug repurposing
          and the development of new therapeutic approaches.

          Our study aims to address the gap in understanding complex diseases
          and drug mechanisms by projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns. In recent years, functional genomics has enabled
          researchers to identify genes that play a role in disease development
          and progression. However, this approach lacks the ability to
          contextualize these findings and provide insights into how these genes
          interact with each other and with environmental factors. To address
          this challenge, we have developed a novel method called PhenoPLIER,
          which clusters genes based on their expression patterns across
          different conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action.


          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of gene expression
          patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By providing a
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, PhenoPLIER can facilitate the discovery of novel
          therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts. Our approach
          has broader significance by enabling researchers to better understand
          the complex interplay between genes and environmental factors in
          disease development and progression.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and
          understanding how they influence complex traits requires insight into
          expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is
          critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions are essential in disease onset and progression. We
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that maps gene-trait

          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of

          regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our work highlights the importance of gene
          co-expression and functional genomics in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the field of
          functional genomics, with the aim of understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits. However, despite advances in
          transcriptome-wide association studies, it remains challenging to
          identify the specific genetic mechanisms underlying disease
          development. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel
          computational approach, PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          allowing us to capture the complex relationships between genes and
          traits in a more comprehensive manner.


          We have applied PhenoPLIER to a large dataset of gene expression
          profiles and disease phenotypes, and found that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. We also observed that our approach is highly accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, we have used PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid
          regulation using a CRISPR screen, and found that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules based on their expression patterns.


          Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene modules in
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By leveraging
          functional genomics data and computational tools, we have uncovered
          novel insights into the complex relationships between genes and
          traits, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches and precision
          medicine strategies.

          In recent years, advances in functional genomics have shed light on
          the intricate interactions between genes in complex traits. However, a

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The study of complex traits, such as diseases, involves understanding
          the interactions between genes and their regulation across different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for
          disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. The method is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which
          accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. We also demonstrate that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our study shows how
          PhenoPLIER can be used to identify therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities, highlighting the broader significance of
          this approach for understanding disease etiology and developing new
          therapies.

              Genes work in concert with each other to carry out their functions
              within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is
              crucial for the development of new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play an essential role in disease onset and
              progression. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on

              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have revolutionized the
              field of disease etiology, but they face a major challenge in
              understanding how genes interact with each other to contribute to
              complex traits. Gene co-expression has been shown to play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression, and recent
              advances in transcriptome-wide association studies have provided
              valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these approaches often
              neglect gene-gene interactions, which can obscure potential
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. To address
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions and can contextualize genetic

              demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and
              prioritizing functionally important players that lack associations
              but are enriched in trait-associated modules. Our study provides a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the

              The coordinated action of genes is essential for their functional
              performance in specific contexts. Understanding the regulation of
              gene expression patterns across various conditions is critical in
              developing new therapies, especially for complex traits. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly

              The current understanding of complex traits, such as disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, is limited by the assumption that
              individual genes play a significant role. However, modern models
              of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions
              are crucial in disease development and progression. In this study,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data to identify disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. We argue that genes work together in specific
              contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these
              genes influence complex traits requires an investigation of
              expression regulation across different conditions. Our previous
              research has demonstrated the importance of this insight for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture
              of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. We propose
              PhenoPLIER's representation, which is based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, we demonstrate that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a new

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the
              gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By understanding how genes act
              in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, we can gain insights into expression regulation across
              different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin
              and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We show that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework
              contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, providing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              The field of genetics has revolutionized our understanding of
              disease mechanisms and drug targets. However, a major challenge in
              this area is the identification of gene-gene interactions that

              groups and reveal potential drug targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Through transcriptome-wide association studies, we

              Our study highlights the importance of analyzing gene expression
              patterns to understand complex traits and disease mechanisms. By
              leveraging functional genomics and gene co-expression, we found
              that diseases are significantly associated with specific groups of
              genes expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is highly
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis
              revealed that functionally important players may not be associated
              with disease but can still be prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These results demonstrate the value of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential drug targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Overall, our study provides a novel

              The field of genetics has long known that genes act in concert
              with each other to perform their functions. However, determining
              how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. The accuracy and relevance of this understanding is
              critical for developing new therapies. In this study, we present a
              novel approach for projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns that highlights disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, our approach provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings
              have broad significance for drug repurposing and the development
              of new therapeutic approaches.

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              The interplay between genes in specific contexts is critical for
              their function. However, determining the influence of these genes
              on complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

              Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              Our study aims to address the gap in understanding complex
              diseases and drug mechanisms by projecting genetic associations
              through gene expression patterns. In recent years, functional
              genomics has enabled researchers to identify genes that play a
              role in disease development and progression. However, this
              approach lacks the ability to contextualize these findings and
              provide insights into how these genes interact with each other and
              with environmental factors. To address this challenge, we have
              developed a novel method called PhenoPLIER, which clusters genes
              based on their expression patterns across different conditions.
              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action.


              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              suggests that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of gene
              expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By
              providing a framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER can facilitate the
              discovery of novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing
              efforts. Our approach has broader significance by enabling
              researchers to better understand the complex interplay between
              genes and environmental factors in disease development and
              progression.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              and understanding how they influence complex traits requires
              insight into expression regulation across different conditions.
              This knowledge is critical for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions are essential in disease onset
              and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach
              reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Overall, our work highlights the importance of gene co-expression
              and functional genomics in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the field of
              functional genomics, with the aim of understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits. However, despite advances
              in transcriptome-wide association studies, it remains challenging
              to identify the specific genetic mechanisms underlying disease
              development. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel
              computational approach, PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, allowing us to capture the complex relationships
              between genes and traits in a more comprehensive manner.


              We have applied PhenoPLIER to a large dataset of gene expression
              profiles and disease phenotypes, and found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. We also observed that our approach is highly accurate
              in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, we have used PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid
              regulation using a CRISPR screen, and found that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules based on their expression patterns.


              Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene modules in
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By leveraging
              functional genomics data and computational tools, we have
              uncovered novel insights into the complex relationships between
              genes and traits, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches
              and precision medicine strategies.

              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
