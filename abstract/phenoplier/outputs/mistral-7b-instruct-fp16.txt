          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          The study aims to develop a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER,
          that can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. The method maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation, based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across different conditions. The study shows that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, the authors find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation.
          Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
          improve our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Gene expression patterns are critical for understanding the functions
          of genes in specific contexts. However, determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. Traditional
          approaches that focus on single-gene analyses have limitations in
          capturing gene-gene interactions and their role in disease development
          and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for more
          accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inference of

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players lacking

          Genes are part of intricate networks that work together to perform
          specific functions in a given context. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires an understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. While individual gene studies
          have provided valuable insights into disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease development and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene expression patterns, trait associations,
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, our approach reveals
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,

          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules and can contextualize these
          associations to reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          In the field of genetic studies, determining how genes influence
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in knowledge,
          we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. We further demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          finding that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the importance of
          grouping genes with similar expression patterns and providing insights
          into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes function together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene
          expression across different conditions is crucial for developing new
          therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been

          In recent years, the field of functional genomics has been rapidly
          advancing our understanding of complex traits, such as diseases and
          disorders. However, genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This is critical
          for developing new therapies that target specific pathways involved in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


          To fill this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This approach has the potential to
          revolutionize our understanding of complex traits and accelerate the
          development of new therapies that target specific pathways involved in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and determining the influence of these genes on complex traits
          requires an understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which can contextualize these associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has
          implications for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          The field of functional genomics has shed light on the importance of
          gene expression patterns in complex traits, but there is still a gap
          in our understanding of how individual genes interact to influence
          these traits. This gap matters because it limits our ability to
          develop effective therapies for diseases that involve multiple genes.
          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns across different conditions and
          drug perturbations to map gene-trait associations into a common latent
          representation. Using this representation, we demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs
          and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen,
          we identify functionally important players that lack individual gene
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, opening up
          new avenues for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation. Our analysis shows that genes
          work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires an
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. We
          have demonstrated the importance of this insight in developing new
          therapies, as it has been shown to be critical for identifying drug
          repurposing opportunities and predicting therapeutic targets. To
          address this challenge, we used transcriptome-wide association studies
          (TWAS) to uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms.
          However, recent models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression.
          Our approach, PhenoPLIER, is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we show that

          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
          Our findings highlight the importance of functional genomics in
          identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for
          complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that

          data to produce a joint analysis. Gene expression patterns are

          one another in specific contexts. We have demonstrated the importance
          of this insight in developing new therapies, and transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover individual genes' roles in

          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which is critical for
          contextualizing complex traits and identifying potential drug targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach combines functional
          genomics with therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing,
          ultimately leading to clustering of complex traits and providing
          insights into disease etiology and mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genetic studies have long been at the forefront of disease etiology
          and drug mechanism discovery, but recent advances in functional
          genomics have revealed that genes act in concert with each other to
          perform their functions. The identification of these gene modules has
          been instrumental in understanding the underlying mechanisms of
          complex traits and developing new therapies. However, traditional
          approaches for analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies have
          limitations in identifying gene-gene interactions, which are critical
          for understanding disease origin and progression. To overcome these
          challenges, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns

          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which will have broader significance in disease etiology
          and drug mechanism discovery.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that

          The field of functional genomics is rapidly evolving, and researchers
          are constantly seeking novel methods to understand the complex
          interactions between genes and disease mechanisms. One significant
          challenge in this field is to identify therapeutic targets that can be
          repurposed to treat complex diseases. This challenge arises from the
          fact that modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease etiology. However, traditional single-gene
          approaches cannot capture these interactions and may miss potential
          targets. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our method uses modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions to identify disease-relevant gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. We show that our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action, and we also find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          Overall, our work provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules and highlights the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Our study presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate that
          genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to execute
          their functions, and this collaboration is critical in the development
          of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
          the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial for disease genesis and progression. In this
          study, we use modules of genes with similar expression patterns under
          the same conditions as our representation. We observe that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we identify functional
          players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that by contextualizing
          genetic associations with groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          provide novel insights into potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Overall, our study presents a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in
          understanding the complex interactions between genes and diseases.
          However, modern models of disease etiology suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression.
          To address this gap in our current understanding of disease
          mechanisms, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a

          modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          PhenoPLIER is able to identify disease-associated genes in relevant
          cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          revealing functionally important players that lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our findings provide
          evidence for the potential role of gene modules in disease etiology
          and suggest that PhenoPLIER can be used as a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations.

          The manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes
          work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and
          determining how they influence complex traits requires an
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified
          individual genes associated with disease mechanisms, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease
          etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with diseases
          relevant to specific cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          identify functionally important players that lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. The manuscript
          concludes that PhenoPLIER's integration of groups of co-expressed
          genes can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
          modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The current state of the art in genetic studies has primarily focused
          on identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant
          mechanisms, but it is widely recognized that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
          gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which enables us to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          Using PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we found that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER to facilitate disease etiology studies and
          drug mechanism discovery by providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
          Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a promising tool for identifying
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, which could lead
          to more effective treatments for complex diseases.

          The study of genes and their interactions in specific contexts is
          crucial for understanding how they contribute to complex traits. In
          this manuscript, we present a novel approach using gene expression
          patterns to identify genetic associations that are associated with
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate that our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen, we find that functionally important players lack associations
          but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
          results highlight the importance of contextualizing genetic
          associations through the use of gene modules to reveal potential
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. Overall, our
          study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the complexity of gene
          expression patterns in different contexts poses a challenge for
          identifying functional genomic insights that can lead to new

          Genetic studies have provided significant insights into the
          pathophysiology of complex traits, but understanding how genes
          influence disease requires a comprehensive approach that considers
          expression regulation across different contexts. In this study, we
          demonstrate that disease etiology and drug mechanisms can be
          accurately predicted by analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our results show that functional genomics approaches can
          identify key players in disease pathways that may have been missed by
          single-gene strategies. We also use CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
          regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that gene co-expression analysis
          can provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by traditional
          approaches. Overall, our results highlight the importance of
          integrating functional genomics data with clinical and genomic data to
          develop more effective treatments for complex diseases.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes act in
          concert with each other to perform their functions is critical for
          developing new therapies. However, determining the influence of these
          genes on complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. In this study, we
          aimed to fill this gap by identifying gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and their association with diseases. Our results
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules

          Genetic studies have long aimed to identify genes associated with
          complex traits and diseases, but the mechanisms underlying these
          associations are often unclear. Functional genomics provides a
          promising approach to understanding how genes work together in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. In this study, we used
          gene co-expression analysis to project genetic associations onto
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We also used a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players
          lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
          contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Overall, our findings have significant
          broader implications for drug discovery and personalized medicine.

          Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes affect complex traits requires
          a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Our study demonstrates the importance of this insight for
          developing new therapies. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have shown that genes act in concert with each other
          to perform their functions. However, determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is
          critical for developing new therapies, as it allows researchers to
          identify potential drug targets and predict their effectiveness. In
          this study, we used gene co-expression analysis to project genetic
          associations onto specific tissue types and disease states. Our
          results showed that diseases were significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach was
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings provide a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, allowing us to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Overall, our work highlights the importance
          of considering the broader context in which genes act when studying
          complex traits and drug mechanisms.

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms, but the complexity of gene expression patterns
          and their interactions make it challenging to identify therapeutic
          targets and predict drug repurposing. Our study proposes a novel
          approach that leverages functional genomics and clustering techniques
          to analyze gene co-expression patterns across different cell types and
          conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
          identifying disease-associated gene modules and accurately predicting
          known drug-disease pairs, as well as inferring mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we show that PhenoPLIER, our CRISPR screen-based
          analysis tool, can contextualize genetic associations by prioritizing
          functionally important players in trait-associated gene modules. Our
          findings suggest that by integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for interpreting genetic
          associations and uncovering potential drug targets missed by
          single-gene approaches. Overall, our study highlights the importance
          of using a holistic approach to understanding complex traits and their
          underlying genetic associations.

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
          understanding how genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions remains challenging. This study
          aimed to address this challenge by projecting genetic associations
          through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. We used gene co-expression analysis to identify
          modules of highly correlated genes expressed in relevant cell types.
          Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with these
          gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings
          demonstrate the value of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          In recent years, genes have been found to act in concert with each
          other in specific contexts, and determining how these genes influence
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in the
          literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions and observes that diseases are significantly

          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease

          therapeutic target discovery tool. Additionally, we use a CRISPR

          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, further validating our
          approach. Overall, our work bridges the gap between gene expression
          studies and functional genomics, providing a novel computational tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The current study highlights the importance of functional genomics and
          gene co-expression analysis in understanding complex traits, disease
          mechanisms, and therapeutic targets. We propose a novel computational
          approach called PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene expression data with
          pharmacological perturbation information to identify modules of genes
          associated with specific traits. Our analysis reveals that diseases
          are often associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs. Furthermore, we
          demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using a CRISPR screen
          to identify important players in lipid regulation that lack direct
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
          findings suggest that PhenoPLIER could be a valuable tool for drug
          repurposing and identifying new therapeutic targets for complex
          diseases.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. However, traditional genetic studies and functional
          genomics approaches have limitations in understanding the complex
          interactions between genes and traits. To address this gap, we
          developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different
          conditions and demonstrates the importance of these modules in disease
          development and drug response. We show that diseases are significantly

          The genetic architecture of complex traits involves the interaction of
          multiple genes in specific contexts. Understanding gene expression
          regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new

          disease-relevant processes, but modern models suggest that gene-gene

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in complex traits, and
          determining these patterns is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models
          of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions also play a significant role. To address this gap in our
          understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known

          use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel and valuable tool for projecting genetic associations through
          gene expression patterns and highlights the importance of studying
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Gene expression patterns are a critical aspect of disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. To better understand how genes interact in specific
          contexts, it is essential to have a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. Genetic studies and
          functional genomics have been instrumental in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
          challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of gene
          expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          demonstrate the utility of computational approaches in identifying
          therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. However, determining how genes interact with each
          other to perform their functions is challenging. This requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Traditional approaches to studying gene-gene interactions
          are limited by the lack of comprehensive data on gene expression
          patterns. To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. Our approach identifies modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which are
          significantly associated with diseases and drug mechanisms. We
          demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action using CRISPR
          screens. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding gene
          expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          provide a valuable resource for therapeutic target discovery and drug
          repurposing.

          The interplay between genes in specific contexts is critical for
          understanding complex traits and developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap,
          we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities.

            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              The study aims to develop a novel computational approach,
              PhenoPLIER, that can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. The method
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation, based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across different conditions. The
              study shows that diseases are significantly associated with gene

              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

              through the lens of gene modules, which can improve our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Gene expression patterns are critical for understanding the

              Genes are part of intricate networks that work together to perform
              specific functions in a given context. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires an understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. While individual gene
              studies have provided valuable insights into disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease

              across the same conditions, our approach reveals that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

              In the field of genetic studies, determining how genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address
              this gap in knowledge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach is accurate
              in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. We further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, finding that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the importance of
              grouping genes with similar expression patterns and providing
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genes function together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene
              expression across different conditions is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been successful in identifying individual genes associated
              with complex traits, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease origin and

              In recent years, the field of functional genomics has been rapidly
              advancing our understanding of complex traits, such as diseases
              and disorders. However, genes act in concert with each other in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how
              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This is critical for developing new therapies that
              target specific pathways involved in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.


              To fill this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has the
              potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex traits and
              accelerate the development of new therapies that target specific
              pathways involved in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and determining the influence of these genes on complex
              traits requires an understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. This is critical for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified
              individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
              modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
              contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has implications
              for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

              Gene expression patterns play a critical role in determining
              complex traits and disease mechanisms. However, modern models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              crucial for disease initiation and progression. In this
              manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By mapping genes with similar expression patterns across
              different conditions, our approach can identify modules of
              functionally important players that are associated with
              disease-relevant traits and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.
              Our findings suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed

              The field of functional genomics has shed light on the importance
              of gene expression patterns in complex traits, but there is still
              a gap in our understanding of how individual genes interact to
              influence these traits. This gap matters because it limits our
              ability to develop effective therapies for diseases that involve
              multiple genes. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns
              across different conditions and drug perturbations to map
              gene-trait associations into a common latent representation. Using
              this representation, we demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and
              infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen,
              we identify functionally important players that lack individual
              gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, opening up new avenues for drug repurposing and

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation. Our
              analysis shows that genes work together in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires an understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. We have demonstrated the importance
              of this insight in developing new therapies, as it has been shown
              to be critical for identifying drug repurposing opportunities and
              predicting therapeutic targets. To address this challenge, we used
              transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to uncover the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, recent models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Our approach,
              PhenoPLIER, is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              we show that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules. Our findings highlight the
              importance of functional genomics in identifying therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing opportunities for complex traits.

              In the field of genetic studies, identifying functional genomics
              and gene co-expression patterns is critical for understanding
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current models of
              complex traits often fail to account for gene-gene interactions
              that play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genetic studies have long been at the forefront of disease
              etiology and drug mechanism discovery, but recent advances in
              functional genomics have revealed that genes act in concert with
              each other to perform their functions. The identification of these
              gene modules has been instrumental in understanding the underlying
              mechanisms of complex traits and developing new therapies.
              However, traditional approaches for analyzing transcriptome-wide
              association studies have limitations in identifying gene-gene

              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that
              integrates gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation
              information to create a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. The approach recognizes the importance of gene networks
              in regulating complex traits and disease development. We
              demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing
              transcriptome-wide association studies, revealing that diseases
              are associated with specific groups of genes expressed in relevant
              cell types. Furthermore, our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and suggests new mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated gene modules. Overall,

              The field of functional genomics is rapidly evolving, and
              researchers are constantly seeking novel methods to understand the
              complex interactions between genes and disease mechanisms. One
              significant challenge in this field is to identify therapeutic
              targets that can be repurposed to treat complex diseases. This
              challenge arises from the fact that modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology.
              However, traditional single-gene approaches cannot capture these
              interactions and may miss potential targets. To address this gap,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method uses
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions to identify disease-relevant gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. We show that our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, and we
              also find that functionally important players lack associations
              but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              These findings suggest that by incorporating groups of

              Our study presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method that

              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint

              The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in
              understanding the complex interactions between genes and diseases.
              However, modern models of disease etiology suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap in our current understanding of
              disease mechanisms, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. By utilizing gene modules with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER is able to
              identify disease-associated genes in relevant cell types,
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER
              by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our findings provide
              evidence for the potential role of gene modules in disease
              etiology and suggest that PhenoPLIER can be used as a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations.

              The manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform
              their functions, and determining how they influence complex traits
              requires an understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have identified individual genes associated with disease
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a critical role in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, which we find to
              be significantly associated with diseases relevant to specific
              cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. The
              manuscript concludes that PhenoPLIER's integration of groups of
              co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,

              The current state of the art in genetic studies has primarily
              focused on identifying individual genes associated with
              disease-relevant mechanisms, but it is widely recognized that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which enables us to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Using PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to facilitate

              a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the lens of gene modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a promising
              tool for identifying therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, which could lead to more effective treatments for
              complex diseases.

              The study of genes and their interactions in specific contexts is
              crucial for understanding how they contribute to complex traits.
              In this manuscript, we present a novel approach using gene
              expression patterns to identify genetic associations that are
              associated with disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We
              demonstrate that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing
              lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the
              importance of contextualizing genetic associations through the use
              of gene modules to reveal potential therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing opportunities. Overall, our study provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the complexity of gene
              expression patterns in different contexts poses a challenge for
              identifying functional genomic insights that can lead to new
              therapeutic targets. In this study, we used gene co-expression
              analysis to identify disease associations through functional
              genomics approaches. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, was able to
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualized genetic associations and revealed
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We also used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we found that
              functionally important players lacked associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall,
              our findings provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which can lead to
              new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.

              Genetic studies have provided significant insights into the
              pathophysiology of complex traits, but understanding how genes
              influence disease requires a comprehensive approach that considers
              expression regulation across different contexts. In this study, we
              demonstrate that disease etiology and drug mechanisms can be
              accurately predicted by analyzing gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our results show that functional genomics
              approaches can identify key players in disease pathways that may
              have been missed by single-gene strategies. We also use CRISPR
              screening to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest
              that gene co-expression analysis can provide a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
              targets missed by traditional approaches. Overall, our results
              highlight the importance of integrating functional genomics data
              with clinical and genomic data to develop more effective
              treatments for complex diseases.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes act
              in concert with each other to perform their functions is critical
              for developing new therapies. However, determining the influence
              of these genes on complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by
              identifying gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and
              their association with diseases. Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in

              Genetic studies have long aimed to identify genes associated with
              complex traits and diseases, but the mechanisms underlying these
              associations are often unclear. Functional genomics provides a
              promising approach to understanding how genes work together in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. In this study, we
              used gene co-expression analysis to project genetic associations
              onto disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We also used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Overall, our findings have significant broader
              implications for drug discovery and personalized medicine.

              Genetic studies have shown that genes act in concert with each
              other to perform their functions. However, determining how these
              genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies,
              as it allows researchers to identify potential drug targets and
              predict their effectiveness. In this study, we used gene
              co-expression analysis to project genetic associations onto
              specific tissue types and disease states. Our results showed that
              diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach was accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, but the complexity of gene
              expression patterns and their interactions make it challenging to
              identify therapeutic targets and predict drug repurposing. Our
              study proposes a novel approach that leverages functional genomics
              and clustering techniques to analyze gene co-expression patterns
              across different cell types and conditions. We demonstrate the
              effectiveness of our approach in identifying disease-associated
              gene modules and accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs,
              as well as inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we show
              that PhenoPLIER, our CRISPR screen-based analysis tool, can
              contextualize genetic associations by prioritizing functionally
              important players in trait-associated gene modules. Our findings
              suggest that by integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for interpreting genetic
              associations and uncovering potential drug targets missed by
              single-gene approaches. Overall, our study highlights the
              importance of using a holistic approach to understanding complex
              traits and their underlying genetic associations.

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
              understanding how genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions remains challenging. This
              study aimed to address this challenge by projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We used gene co-expression
              analysis to identify modules of highly correlated genes expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with these gene modules, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings demonstrate the value of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules.

              Genetic studies have shown that genes interact with each other in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. However,
              understanding the influence of these genes on complex traits
              requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new
              therapies, and transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

              In recent years, genes have been found to act in concert with each
              other in specific contexts, and determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

              The current study highlights the importance of functional genomics
              and gene co-expression analysis in understanding complex traits,
              disease mechanisms, and therapeutic targets. We propose a novel
              computational approach called PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene
              expression data with pharmacological perturbation information to
              identify modules of genes associated with specific traits. Our
              analysis reveals that diseases are often associated with modules
              expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness
              of our approach by using a CRISPR screen to identify important
              players in lipid regulation that lack direct associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our findings suggest that
              PhenoPLIER could be a valuable tool for drug repurposing and
              identifying new therapeutic targets for complex diseases.

              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. However, traditional genetic studies and
              functional genomics approaches have limitations in understanding
              the complex interactions between genes and traits. To address this
              gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
              identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across different conditions and demonstrates the importance of
              these modules in disease development and drug response. We show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and identify functionally important players that lack associations
              but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between
              genes, traits, and diseases, and have broader significance for
              drug discovery and precision medicine.

              The genetic architecture of complex traits involves the
              interaction of multiple genes in specific contexts. Understanding
              gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial
              for developing new therapies and understanding disease mechanisms.

              suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential to disease

              Gene expression patterns are a critical aspect of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. To better understand how genes interact in
              specific contexts, it is essential to have a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. Genetic studies and functional genomics have been

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. However, determining how genes interact with
              each other to perform their functions is challenging. This
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. Traditional approaches to studying
              gene-gene interactions are limited by the lack of comprehensive
              data on gene expression patterns. To address this challenge, we
              developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach
              identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions, which are significantly associated
              with diseases and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate the
              effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action using CRISPR screens. Our
              findings highlight the importance of understanding gene expression
              patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a
              valuable resource for therapeutic target discovery and drug
              repurposing.

              Genetic studies have been instrumental in the understanding of

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
