 The study of genetic associations has long been a focus in the field of functional genomics, with the aim of understanding complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. However, current methodologies often fail to account for the fact that genes act in concert with each other to influence these traits. This study seeks to address this gap by investigating the role of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. 

In this research, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which uses gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to identify significant associations between diseases and gene expression patterns. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their mechanisms of action. 

Furthermore, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, finding that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that our method can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. 

In conclusion, the integration of co-expressed gene groups allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
