          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          perform their functions. To determine the influence of these genes on
          complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions is essential. While transcriptome-wide

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Gene expression patterns and their relationships with complex traits
          have long been a subject of research in the field of functional
          genomics. However, traditional approaches to studying gene-gene
          interactions have limited our ability to fully understand how these
          genes contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this
          study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines
          transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological
          perturbation data to map gene-trait associations into a common latent
          representation. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, and we show that
          diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We
          also used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which can help contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our findings have broader significance in drug repurposing
          and clustering of complex traits, highlighting the importance of
          integrating functional genomics data with clinical and pharmacological
          information to better understand disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          The study of genetic associations with complex traits has been
          challenging due to the lack of a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which enables
          us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
          PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screening. We
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can help identify
          new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          Genetic studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of
          complex traits and disease mechanisms, but the challenge lies in
          determining how individual genes interact with each other to produce
          these outcomes. The current models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          development and progression. However, existing methods for analyzing
          genetic associations have limitations in identifying these
          interactions and inferring their biological significance. In this
          study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          leverages functional genomics data to map gene expression patterns
          into common latent representations. This approach allows us to analyze
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          together, enabling more accurate predictions of known drug-disease
          pairs and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. We also
          demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER in prioritizing functionally
          important players that lack individual genetic associations but are
          enriched in trait-associated modules. Our results provide a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which can help contextualize disease mechanisms and
          inform drug repurposing strategies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining how genes
          influence complex traits. Understanding these patterns is critical for
          developing new therapies and repurposing existing drugs. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes associated with disease, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are essential for disease etiology and progression. To
          address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings demonstrate
          the power of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          The study of genes and their interactions is a critical field in
          understanding complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. However, determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. Previous research has shown that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression, but existing methods have limitations in analyzing the
          complexity of these interactions. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis. By utilizing modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings provide a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          highlight the importance of grouping co-expressed genes to understand
          complex traits.

          Genetic studies have uncovered complex associations between genes and
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions is crucial to
          identify new therapeutic targets for diseases. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, we use PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation
          using CRISPR screens and identify functionally important players that
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results provide a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which can inform therapeutic strategies for complex diseases.

          Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together
          in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          Recent research has shown that this insight is crucial for developing

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait

          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important
          players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the importance of
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which is essential for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing
          existing drugs.

          In recent years, gene expression studies have provided valuable
          insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
          However, traditional methods of analyzing these data have been limited
          by their focus on single-gene associations, which fail to capture the
          complex interactions between genes that drive disease development and
          progression. To address this gap in the literature, we developed
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data to map gene modules
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
          identifies groups of co-expressed genes that are associated with
          specific disease mechanisms and drug response, allowing us to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.


          Using PhenoPLIER, we found that diseases were significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and found that functionally important players lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which has important implications for disease etiology and drug
          mechanism studies.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Gene
          expression patterns are influenced by various factors and can vary
          across different conditions to perform their functions effectively.
          Determining how these genes affect complex traits requires an
          understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in expression
          regulation. Modern models of the architecture of complex traits
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease
          onset and progression. Our approach, based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, has shown that
          diseases are significantly associated with these modules, especially
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by prioritizing
          functionally important players within trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, our novel framework, PhenoPLIER, contextualizes genetic
          associations through groups of co-expressed genes, providing a
          valuable tool for identifying potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          Context: In recent years, the field of functional genomics has focused
          on understanding gene expression patterns and their role in disease
          etiology. However, traditional single-gene studies have limitations in
          identifying complex disease mechanisms and drug targets. The purpose
          of this study is to develop a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis.


          Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that maps gene
          expression patterns across different conditions into modules of
          co-expressed genes. By using machine learning algorithms to cluster
          these modules, we can identify disease-associated patterns that may
          not be detected by analyzing individual genes. Our analysis reveals
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We further
          demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, where we find functionally important players
          lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules.


          Conclusion: Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This approach has important implications
          for disease etiology and drug discovery, enabling researchers to
          identify complex disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
          Furthermore, our findings suggest that gene modules may be useful
          biomarkers for disease diagnosis and treatment, providing a new
          direction for future research in the field of functional genomics.

          The manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The approach
          is based on the observation that genes work together in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits requires an understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have provided valuable insights into individual genes' roles
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The study
          finds that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and the approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, the authors use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. The results highlight the importance of incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes for contextualizing genetic associations
          and identifying potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can aid
          in drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The field of genetic studies has long been plagued by the difficulty
          of understanding how genes interact to produce complex traits, such as
          disease. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar

          novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene

          of co-expressed genes in the analysis of genetic associations and
          reveal new potential targets for drug development. Overall, PhenoPLIER
          provides a powerful tool for integrating gene expression data with

          understand complex traits and diseases.

          Our paper presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method for integrating
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation. This allows for a joint analysis of how
          genes work together to influence complex traits. We demonstrate the
          importance of understanding expression regulation across different
          conditions in developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          critical to disease development and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns under the same conditions. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with modules of genes expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies. We conclude that our
          method provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which is important for
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The field of genetic studies and functional genomics has advanced
          significantly in recent years, but the understanding of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains elusive.
          This research addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene expression patterns and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, which can lead to better therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing strategies.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in the development of
          complex traits. However, determining how these genes work together to
          influence these traits requires a comprehensive understanding of their
          regulation in various contexts. Our study shows that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is highly accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we
          found that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          by utilizing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our study
          highlights the importance of incorporating gene expression patterns in
          the analysis of complex traits and offers valuable insights into
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          The field of functional genomics seeks to understand how genes
          interact with each other and their environment to regulate complex
          traits. While previous studies have focused on individual gene
          expression patterns, our research highlights the importance of
          examining gene modules in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We
          utilized a novel approach combining gene co-expression analysis and
          clustering of complex traits to identify significantly associated gene
          modules in relevant cell types. Our findings show that these gene
          modules are strongly linked to known drug-disease pairs and can
          predict their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
          important players lack associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By integrating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a new tool for
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby advancing
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts.

          In this manuscript, we present a novel approach for understanding the
          complex relationships between genes and their involvement in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. Our findings show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, highlighting the importance of studying expression regulation
          across different conditions. We demonstrate that our method is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results provide a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
          inform potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.
          Overall, our findings have important implications for functional
          genomics and genetic studies, and highlight the potential for
          clustering complex traits based on gene co-expression patterns.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Context: Genetic studies have long struggled to identify the
          underlying mechanisms of complex traits, such as disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. This is because genes often act in concert with each
          other in specific contexts, making it difficult to isolate their
          individual effects. However, recent advances in functional genomics
          have shown that determining how genes influence these traits requires
          a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Our study aims to build on this knowledge and provide new
          insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.


          Content: We developed an approach called PhenoPLIER, which uses gene
          co-expression analysis to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can accurately
          predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We
          applied this approach to a variety of complex traits, including lipid
          regulation, and found that functionally important players often lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
          results highlight the importance of considering gene networks when
          interpreting genetic data and provide a novel framework for drug
          discovery and repurposing.


          Conclusion: In conclusion, our study demonstrates that by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This approach has significant implications
          for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a novel framework
          for interpreting complex genetic data and identifying new therapeutic
          targets. Our results highlight the importance of considering gene
          networks when analyzing genetic data and pave the way for future
          studies in functional genomics and personalized medicine.

          In order to understand the complex interplay of genes in the context
          of disease development, it is essential to have a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          Our study highlights the importance of this insight in developing new
          therapies by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen, we identify functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies and provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, our findings
          underscore the critical role of functional genomics and gene
          co-expression analysis in identifying therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have shown that genes act in
          concert with each other to perform their functions, but determining
          how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our study
          addresses this gap by using gene co-expression patterns to project
          genetic associations and identify potential therapeutic targets and
          drug repurposing opportunities. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broad
          implications for drug development and disease etiology research.

          Genes work in unison to accomplish their functions, but determining

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Gene expression patterns are critical for determining the functions of
          genes and their role in complex traits. However, determining how these
          genes interact with each other to perform their functions is a
          challenging task. In this study, we have developed a novel approach
          using gene co-expression analysis to identify disease-associated gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results show that these
          modules are significantly associated with specific diseases and can

          The study demonstrates that genes collaborate with each other in
          specific situations to perform their functions. However, understanding
          the influence of these genes on complex traits requires a
          comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Our findings highlight the importance of this insight for
          developing novel therapies. The results of our research reveal that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and can accurately predict known drug-disease
          pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we found that
          functionally important players lacking associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER when analyzing
          lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. In conclusion, our study shows
          that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms, but determining how genes interact with each other to
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. Our study addresses
          this gap by using gene co-expression analysis to identify significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. We demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing valuable
          insights into the underlying biological processes involved in disease
          development and response to treatment.


          To further contextualize genetic associations, we applied PhenoPLIER,
          a CRISPR screen-based method that analyzes lipid regulation, to
          prioritize functionally important players lacking associations but
          enriched in trait-associated modules. Our findings reveal the
          importance of considering groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting
          genetic associations and suggest potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          integrating gene module information into disease etiology and drug
          mechanism studies, enabling researchers to identify new therapeutic
          targets and repurpose existing drugs. Overall, our study highlights
          the critical role of functional genomics in elucidating complex
          disease mechanisms and facilitating the discovery of innovative
          therapies.

          The coordinated action of genes is essential for their functionality
          in specific contexts. To understand how genes influence complex
          traits, it is necessary to gain insight into expression regulation
          across different conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify individual genes associated with disease-relevant

          In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding
          the complex interplay between genes and how they contribute to various
          traits. However, identifying these relationships can be challenging
          due to the large number of genes involved. To address this issue,
          researchers have developed computational methods such as PhenoPLIER,
          which aims to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes that exhibit
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The study
          finds that diseases are significantly associated with these gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, the
          researchers found that functionally important players lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This finding suggests that gene modules may play an
          important role in disease development and drug discovery. Overall,
          this study highlights the potential of computational methods such as
          PhenoPLIER to bridge the gap between gene expression studies and
          disease etiology, ultimately leading to more effective therapeutic
          interventions.

          repurposing drugs.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The context: Understanding the complex interplay between genes and
          disease-relevant mechanisms is critical for developing new therapies.
          However, traditional gene-based approaches have limited insights into
          the role of gene-gene interactions in disease pathogenesis.


          Content: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This approach utilizes modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions to identify
          disease-associated gene sets. We demonstrate that our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, highlighting the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, emphasizing the utility of our
          approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets.


          Conclusion: Our findings reveal the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease pathogenesis and provide a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This knowledge can be leveraged to identify novel therapeutic targets
          and repurpose drugs for treating complex diseases. Overall, our
          approach paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately leading to the
          development of more effective therapies.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a critical aspect for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have provided valuable insights into individual gene roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different
          conditions, allowing us to identify diseases significantly associated
          with relevant cell type-expressed gene modules. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene
          co-expression and pharmacological perturbation data in identifying
          disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

          The study of complex traits, such as diseases and disorders, requires
          a thorough understanding of the interplay between genes. While
          individual gene expression patterns have been linked to specific
          traits, it is widely accepted that gene-gene interactions play a
          critical role in disease etiology and progression. This highlights the
          need for new computational approaches to identify these interactions
          and their mechanisms of action. In this manuscript, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel method that maps gene expression patterns and drug
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions and accurately predicts
          known disease-drug associations. We further demonstrate the usefulness
          of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, where
          we find that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. These results provide insights into disease
          mechanisms and drug repurposing, ultimately paving the way for new
          therapeutic targets.

          The coordinated action of genes is essential for their functional
          performance, and understanding the mechanisms underlying expression
          regulation across different conditions is critical for identifying
          therapeutic targets for complex traits. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been useful in uncovering the roles of
          individual genes in disease-relevant processes, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology

          PhenoPLIER in uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms through
          gene expression patterns.

          Context: Complex traits are influenced by multiple genes and their
          interactions, but determining these relationships requires a
          comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions. This insight is critical for developing novel therapies to
          treat diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify individual genes that contribute to disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease etiology and progression.


          Content: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally
          important players that lack associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: Our results highlight the importance of understanding gene
          expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel computational approach to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation, allowing for joint analysis and accurate
          prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inference of mechanisms of
          action. Our findings also emphasize the role of gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types in disease etiology and progression. Overall,
          our study provides valuable insights into the complex architecture of
          complex traits and their relationship to disease and drug mechanisms.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a deeper
          insight into expression regulation across different conditions. The
          importance of this knowledge cannot be overstated as it is critical
          for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. This is where PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach, comes into the picture. It maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in the development and
          progression of complex diseases. However, determining how genes
          interact to influence these traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
          of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are
          essential for disease origin and progression. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicted
          known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action, indicating
          its potential for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing
          drugs. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and discovered that functionally important players lack
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, highlighting the importance of gene expression patterns in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Overall, our study provides a
          novel approach for projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, which highlights disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, and has broader significance for personalized medicine and
          precision therapeutics.

              Genes function in concert with one another within specific
              contexts to perform their functions. To determine the influence of
              these genes on complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions is essential.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
              individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial

              players lacking associations were prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes and provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Gene expression patterns and their relationships with complex
              traits have long been a subject of research in the field of
              functional genomics. However, traditional approaches to studying
              gene-gene interactions have limited our ability to fully
              understand how these genes contribute to disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that combines transcriptome-wide
              association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to map
              gene-trait associations into a common latent representation. Our
              method is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, and we show that diseases are
              significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We also
              used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
              help contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings have
              broader significance in drug repurposing and clustering of complex
              traits, highlighting the importance of integrating functional
              genomics data with clinical and pharmacological information to
              better understand disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes work in concert with each other to perform their functions

              The study of genetic associations with complex traits has been

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              Genetic studies have contributed significantly to our
              understanding of complex traits and disease mechanisms, but the
              challenge lies in determining how individual genes interact with
              each other to produce these outcomes. The current models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease development and progression.
              However, existing methods for analyzing genetic associations have
              limitations in identifying these interactions and inferring their
              biological significance. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that leverages functional genomics data to
              map gene expression patterns into common latent representations.
              This approach allows us to analyze gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data together, enabling more accurate
              predictions of known drug-disease pairs and the identification of
              novel therapeutic targets. We also demonstrate the potential of
              PhenoPLIER in prioritizing functionally important players that
              lack individual genetic associations but are enriched in
              trait-associated modules. Our results provide a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can help contextualize disease mechanisms and
              inform drug repurposing strategies.

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining how
              genes influence complex traits. Understanding these patterns is
              critical for developing new therapies and repurposing existing

            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we

            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To understand the influence of these genes on complex
              traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions is necessary. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped identify the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              Genetic studies have uncovered complex associations between genes

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work
              together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
              Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a

              different conditions. Recent research has shown that this insight

              the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent space for joint analysis. Gene expression patterns
              across different contexts play a crucial role in the development
              of complex traits, and functional genomics provides valuable
              insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. However,
              existing models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical
              to disease etiology and progression, which highlights the need for
              more comprehensive approaches to understanding genetic
              associations. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the importance of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which is essential for identifying therapeutic targets
              and repurposing existing drugs.

              In recent years, gene expression studies have provided valuable
              insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic
              targets. However, traditional methods of analyzing these data have
              been limited by their focus on single-gene associations, which
              fail to capture the complex interactions between genes that drive
              disease development and progression. To address this gap in the
              literature, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data to map gene modules into a common latent representation for
              joint analysis. Our method identifies groups of co-expressed genes
              that are associated with specific disease mechanisms and drug
              response, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Using PhenoPLIER, we found that diseases were significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, we used a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players lacked associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that
              by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which has important implications
              for disease etiology and drug mechanism studies.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Gene expression patterns are influenced by various
              factors and can vary across different conditions to perform their
              functions effectively. Determining how these genes affect complex
              traits requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms
              involved in expression regulation. Modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a significant role in disease onset and progression. Our
              approach, based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, has shown that diseases are
              significantly associated with these modules, especially in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by prioritizing
              functionally important players within trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, our novel framework, PhenoPLIER, contextualizes
              genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes,
              providing a valuable tool for identifying potential targets missed

              limitations in identifying complex disease mechanisms and drug
              targets. The purpose of this study is to develop a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis.


              Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that maps
              gene expression patterns across different conditions into modules
              of co-expressed genes. By using machine learning algorithms to
              cluster these modules, we can identify disease-associated patterns
              that may not be detected by analyzing individual genes. Our
              analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules.


              Conclusion: Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has important
              implications for disease etiology and drug discovery, enabling
              researchers to identify complex disease mechanisms and potential
              therapeutic targets. Furthermore, our findings suggest that gene
              modules may be useful biomarkers for disease diagnosis and
              treatment, providing a new direction for future research in the
              field of functional genomics.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

              The manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The
              approach is based on the observation that genes work together in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how
              these genes influence complex traits requires an understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
              insights into individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a critical role in disease etiology and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The study
              finds that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and the approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, the authors use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. The results highlight the importance of incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes for contextualizing genetic
              associations and identifying potential therapeutic targets missed
              by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can aid in drug repurposing and clustering of
              complex traits.

              The field of genetic studies has long been plagued by the
              difficulty of understanding how genes interact to produce complex
              traits, such as disease. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By
              identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions, our method provides a novel framework
              for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

              genetic associations and reveal new potential targets for drug
              development. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for
              integrating gene expression data with other types of biological
              and clinical information to better understand complex traits and
              diseases.

              Our paper presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method for
              integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation. This allows
              for a joint analysis of how genes work together to influence
              complex traits. We demonstrate the importance of understanding
              expression regulation across different conditions in developing
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical to
              disease development and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation
              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              under the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
              associated with modules of genes expressed in relevant cell types,
              and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the potential of
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. We conclude that our
              method provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which is important
              for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              The field of genetic studies and functional genomics has advanced
              significantly in recent years, but the understanding of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains
              elusive. This research addresses this gap by introducing
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression
              patterns and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in

              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can lead to better therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing strategies.

              The field of functional genomics seeks to understand how genes
              interact with each other and their environment to regulate complex
              traits. While previous studies have focused on individual gene
              expression patterns, our research highlights the importance of
              examining gene modules in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We
              utilized a novel approach combining gene co-expression analysis
              and clustering of complex traits to identify significantly
              associated gene modules in relevant cell types. Our findings show
              that these gene modules are strongly linked to known drug-disease
              pairs and can predict their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
              used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that

              In this manuscript, we present a novel approach for understanding
              the complex relationships between genes and their involvement in
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our findings show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, highlighting the importance of studying
              expression regulation across different conditions. We demonstrate
              that our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results provide a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules, which can inform potential therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing strategies. Overall, our findings
              have important implications for functional genomics and genetic
              studies, and highlight the potential for clustering complex traits
              based on gene co-expression patterns.

              Context: Genetic studies have long struggled to identify the
              underlying mechanisms of complex traits, such as disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. This is because genes often act in concert
              with each other in specific contexts, making it difficult to
              isolate their individual effects. However, recent advances in
              functional genomics have shown that determining how genes
              influence these traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. Our study aims
              to build on this knowledge and provide new insights into the
              molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.


              Content: We developed an approach called PhenoPLIER, which uses
              gene co-expression analysis to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action. We applied this approach to a variety of complex
              traits, including lipid regulation, and found that functionally
              important players often lacked associations but were prioritized
              in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the importance
              of considering gene networks when interpreting genetic data and
              provide a novel framework for drug discovery and repurposing.


              Conclusion: In conclusion, our study demonstrates that by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has significant
              implications for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a
              novel framework for interpreting complex genetic data and
              identifying new therapeutic targets. Our results highlight the
              importance of considering gene networks when analyzing genetic
              data and pave the way for future studies in functional genomics
              and personalized medicine.

              In order to understand the complex interplay of genes in the
              context of disease development, it is essential to have a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. Our study highlights the importance of this

              functionally important players that lack associations but are

              Genes work in unison to accomplish their functions, but
              determining how they influence complex traits requires a
              comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              different contexts. Our study shows that this insight is crucial
              for developing new therapies. We find that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discover that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
              revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Gene expression patterns are critical for determining the
              functions of genes and their role in complex traits. However,
              determining how these genes interact with each other to perform
              their functions is a challenging task. In this study, we have
              developed a novel approach using gene co-expression analysis to
              identify disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our results show that these modules are significantly
              associated with specific diseases and can predict known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, our approach provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, allowing us to contextualize disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. By identifying potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies, we can move forward in developing new
              therapies for complex diseases.

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms, but determining how genes interact with each
              other to influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. Our study addresses this gap by using gene
              co-expression analysis to identify significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. We demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing
              valuable insights into the underlying biological processes
              involved in disease development and response to treatment.


              To further contextualize genetic associations, we applied
              PhenoPLIER, a CRISPR screen-based method that analyzes lipid
              regulation, to prioritize functionally important players lacking
              associations but enriched in trait-associated modules. Our
              findings reveal the importance of considering groups of
              co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic associations and
              suggest potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for integrating gene module
              information into disease etiology and drug mechanism studies,
              enabling researchers to identify new therapeutic targets and
              repurpose existing drugs. Overall, our study highlights the
              critical role of functional genomics in elucidating complex
              disease mechanisms and facilitating the discovery of innovative
              therapies.

              The coordinated action of genes is essential for their
              functionality in specific contexts. To understand how genes
              influence complex traits, it is necessary to gain insight into
              expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge
              is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify individual genes
              associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a significant role in disease origin and progression. We
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In recent years, there has been a growing interest in
              understanding the complex interplay between genes and how they
              contribute to various traits. However, identifying these
              relationships can be challenging due to the large number of genes
              involved. To address this issue, researchers have developed
              computational methods such as PhenoPLIER, which aims to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach
              is based on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. The study finds that diseases
              are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, the researchers
              found that functionally important players lacked associations but
              were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              finding suggests that gene modules may play an important role in
              disease development and drug discovery. Overall, this study
              highlights the potential of computational methods such as
              PhenoPLIER to bridge the gap between gene expression studies and
              disease etiology, ultimately leading to more effective therapeutic
              interventions.

              The context: Understanding the complex interplay between genes and
              disease-relevant mechanisms is critical for developing new
              therapies. However, traditional gene-based approaches have limited
              insights into the role of gene-gene interactions in disease
              pathogenesis.


              Content: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This approach utilizes modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions to identify disease-associated gene sets. We
              demonstrate that our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action,
              highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              pathogenesis. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER, emphasizing the utility of our approach for
              identifying novel therapeutic targets.


              Conclusion: Our findings reveal the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease pathogenesis and provide a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This knowledge can be leveraged to identify novel
              therapeutic targets and repurpose drugs for treating complex
              diseases. Overall, our approach paves the way for a more
              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, ultimately leading to the development of more
              effective therapies.

              In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a critical aspect
              for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have provided valuable insights into individual gene roles
              in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions, allowing us to
              identify diseases significantly associated with relevant cell
              type-expressed gene modules. Our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and find that functionally important players lacking associations
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene co-expression
              and pharmacological perturbation data in identifying disease
              mechanisms and therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

              The study of complex traits, such as diseases and disorders,
              requires a thorough understanding of the interplay between genes.
              While individual gene expression patterns have been linked to
              specific traits, it is widely accepted that gene-gene interactions
              play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. This
              highlights the need for new computational approaches to identify
              these interactions and their mechanisms of action. In this
              manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that maps gene
              expression patterns and drug perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions and accurately predicts known disease-drug
              associations. We further demonstrate the usefulness of PhenoPLIER
              by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, where we find
              that functionally important players are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. These results provide insights into
              disease mechanisms and drug repurposing, ultimately paving the way
              for new therapeutic targets.

              The coordinated action of genes is essential for their functional

              Context: Complex traits are influenced by multiple genes and their
              interactions, but determining these relationships requires a
              comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              various conditions. This insight is critical for developing novel
              therapies to treat diseases. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped identify individual genes that contribute to
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression.


              Content: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms

              associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: Our results highlight the importance of understanding
              gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel computational approach to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation, allowing for joint analysis and
              accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inference of

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a deeper insight into expression regulation across
              different conditions. The importance of this knowledge cannot be
              overstated as it is critical for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. This is where PhenoPLIER, a computational approach,
              comes into the picture. It maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation.

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in the development
              and progression of complex diseases. However, determining how
              genes interact to influence these traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict
              that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease origin and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we
              found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicted
              known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action,
              indicating its potential for identifying therapeutic targets and
              repurposing drugs. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and discovered that functionally
              important players lack associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the
              importance of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. Overall, our study provides a novel approach for
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
              which highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and has
              broader significance for personalized medicine and precision
              therapeutics.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
