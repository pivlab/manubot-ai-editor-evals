The study of complex traits relies on a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, they fail to account for gene interactions and their impact on complex diseases (e.g., drug repurposing). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our findings highlight that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach, has been developed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The collaborative function of genes in specific contexts is essential for understanding complex traits and developing new therapies. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play an indispensable part in determining disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER's innovative approach relies on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, demonstrating significant associations between diseases and these cell type-specific modules. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action based on transcriptomic data. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, the integration of groups of co-expressed genes into our computational framework contextualizes genetic associations and unveils potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits through gene module analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to drug repurposing and disease etiology interpretation.</td>

In this study, we address a critical gap in the literature by developing and implementing PhenoPLIER - an innovative computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By exploring gene co-expression patterns across different conditions, our method uncovers mechanistic insights essential for devising novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable information on the role of individual genes in disease processes; however, modern models suggest that complex traits are significantly influenced by gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's unique approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes and their relevance to specific conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations between diseases and these gene modules while accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

Using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. This finding highlights the potential of our approach to contextualize genetic associations and reveal therapeutic targets missed through single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations within the context of gene co-expression patterns and functional networks. By doing so, this study significantly advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms while paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions in complex disorders.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

We present PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach that unlocks the complex interplay between genetic associations and disease etiology by translating gene expression patterns into a unified latent representation. Understanding how genes collaborate to modulate intricate traits requires a comprehensive evaluation of their regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions. While single-gene studies have shed light on individual roles in disease processes, modern models predict that gene interactions play an essential role in complex trait origins and progression.

PhenoPLIER constructs modules consisting of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions, revealing the profound connection between diseases and specific cell types. Our approach adeptly identifies known drug-disease pairs and elucidates therapeutic mechanisms by predicting disease etiology with remarkable accuracy. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally significant players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack associations themselves.

In summary, utilizing gene co-expression patterns enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. This innovative framework paves the way for a deeper comprehension of complex traits through the lens of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false
