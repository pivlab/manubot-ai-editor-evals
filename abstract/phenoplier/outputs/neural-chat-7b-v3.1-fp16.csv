 Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing complex traits. Understanding the expression regulation of these genes across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, our approach reveals a connection between diseases and associated gene modules expressed in crucial cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and sheds light on the mechanisms of action. By analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we found that functionally important players may lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

 Genes function synergistically in various contexts to carry out their duties. To comprehensively understand the influence of these genes on complex traits, a deeper understanding of expression regulation is essential across different conditions. Such knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the etiology and progression of diseases. Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, we map gene-trait associations alongside pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is built upon modules containing genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under particular conditions. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, deciphers mechanisms of action, and also helps prioritize important players without direct associations by featuring them in trait-associated modules. To further demonstrate this approach's effectiveness, we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, whereby functionally significant genes lacking explicit associations were prioritized based on their presence within PhenoPLIER-constructed gene modules.","[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

 Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing complex traits. Understanding gene expression regulation across various conditions is vital for comprehending the mechanisms related to disease and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in identifying individual genes' roles in disease-related processes. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits emphasize that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease initiation and progression. Introducing PhenoPLIER, we developed a computational method to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen assessing lipid regulation, we found functionally important players without existing associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
