          "output": "Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits. Such insights are pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify that key functional genes, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a shared latent space with pharmacological data. This method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling a comprehensive analysis of complex traits. Our results demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug mechanisms, potentially transforming functional genomics and precision medicine.",

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method shows proficiency in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations, yet functionally significant, are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic associations and pharmacological data within a unified latent space. By analyzing modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, PhenoPLIER effectively links diseases to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers drugs' mechanisms of action. Our findings include the prioritization of functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by highlighting the broader significance of gene co-expression networks, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating the analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights functionally important genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits by integrating co-expression information, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This novel framework offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the discovery of drug mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

          "output": "Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the collective information of co-expressed gene groups to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": "Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Our method relies on the identification of gene modules with coherent expression profiles across various conditions, enabling the integration of complex trait associations with drug response data. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as validated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression networks. It offers a powerful framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis, thereby contributing to the precision medicine paradigm.",

Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of complex diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that disease associations are significantly enriched within gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated gene modules.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by leveraging co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene modules, with implications for disease etiology and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages gene co-expression modules to capture the collective behavior of genes across various conditions, providing mechanistic insights into complex trait regulation. Our findings demonstrate that disease states are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic associations by emphasizing the importance of gene networks, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies might overlook. This framework has broad implications for the clustering of complex traits and the discovery of drug mechanisms, propelling the field of functional genomics forward.",

Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles, and understanding their collective influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation under varying conditions—a crucial aspect for the advancement of novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes within trait-associated modules, even when these genes do not exhibit direct associations.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a more comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional approaches. This novel framework offers a transformative perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Understanding the interplay between genes and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets, yet current genetic studies often overlook the intricate gene-gene interactions that underpin disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene contributions to disease, they fall short in capturing the collective influence of gene networks. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data within a unified latent space, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our method leverages the co-expression of gene clusters across various conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights functionally important genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis, offering a powerful framework that contextualizes genetic associations within gene networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets and informing drug repurposing strategies. This approach promises to refine our understanding of complex trait clustering and propel functional genomics research forward.",

Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of complex diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER leverages gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions—to construct its latent representation. Our analysis reveals that disease states are significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes that traditional association studies might overlook.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expressed gene clusters, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise remain undetected. This framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug discovery.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease progression remains elusive. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This model leverages gene co-expression modules, capturing the coordinated activity of genes across various conditions, to provide mechanistic insights into complex trait associations. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action, with diseases showing significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach promises to advance the clustering of complex traits and facilitate the discovery of novel drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of functional genomics.",

Genes collaborate within specific biological contexts to execute their functions, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. The method shows proficiency in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct associations, highlighting them within trait-associated gene modules.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules, providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.",

Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current approaches often overlook the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes, they fall short in capturing the intricate interplay between genes that contributes to disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations with diseases in relevant cell types and accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also identifies key regulatory genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This framework paves the way for drug repurposing and the discovery of drug mechanisms, offering a powerful tool for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

          "output": "We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of complex diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation by identifying modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that these gene modules, particularly when expressed in relevant cell types, are significantly correlated with disease states. The method exhibits precision in predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that may lack direct associations, yet are integral to trait-associated modules.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules, with implications for disease understanding and drug discovery.",

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes under similar conditions, enabling the dissection of complex trait architectures. Our findings demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of our method. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach represents a significant stride in functional genomics, offering a robust framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we discovered that key regulatory genes, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression to uncover insights into disease etiology and inform drug repurposing strategies.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a powerful tool to contextualize genetic associations, thereby highlighting disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional methods. This advancement has broad implications for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, propelling the field towards more targeted and effective interventions.",

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression modules to provide insights into disease etiology and inform drug repurposing strategies.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression to uncover insights into disease etiology and inform drug repurposing efforts.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. However, a comprehensive method to link gene co-expression patterns to disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains elusive. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages gene expression data to project genetic associations onto networks of co-expressed genes, or gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER successfully contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This framework advances our ability to interpret complex genetic data and holds promise for identifying novel drug repurposing opportunities and clustering complex traits.",

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and is pivotal for the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene modules that are expressed in pertinent cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid regulation, we discovered that certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations via the prism of gene expression modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing strategies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease traits are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are nevertheless prioritized within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a powerful tool to contextualize genetic associations, thereby highlighting disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional methods. This framework has broad implications for enhancing our understanding of complex traits and streamlining the drug discovery process.",

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and is pivotal for the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular environments. Our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression networks to interpret genetic links, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework offers a refined perspective for understanding genetic associations via the prism of gene expression patterns.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This study addresses the gap by leveraging gene co-expression to elucidate the genetic basis of diseases and identify potential drug targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene expression profiles with genetic associations to identify disease-relevant gene modules and predict drug-disease relationships. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also highlighting functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in disease through co-expression networks. By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation as a case study, we showcase the ability of PhenoPLIER to prioritize trait-associated genes that traditional single-gene approaches might miss. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology by contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules but also offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation identified key functional genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current models lack a comprehensive approach to elucidate gene-gene interactions and their implications in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short in addressing the collective influence of gene networks. To bridge this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating the analysis of co-expressed gene modules under various conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules active in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that key regulatory genes, although not directly associated with traits, are identified within trait-associated modules. This study not only enhances our understanding of the genetic basis of diseases but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current models inadequately capture the essence of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short in addressing the collective influence of gene networks. To bridge this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating the simultaneous analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our results demonstrate that these modules, which consist of genes with correlated expression patterns in relevant cell types, are significantly associated with disease phenotypes. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also reveals potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations with traits, are implicated in disease-relevant pathways, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation. This study not only enhances our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to the precision medicine paradigm.",

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation indicates that genes lacking direct associations, yet crucial for function, are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in highlighting therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the complex architecture of traits suggests that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. This gap in knowledge underscores the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions to develop effective therapies. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes under similar conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex traits but also offers a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.",

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": "While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. By integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where diseases and drugs converge on shared gene expression modules, revealing the cellular contexts in which these associations are significant. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into drug mechanisms of action. Notably, in a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER successfully prioritized key regulatory genes that lacked direct associations, underscoring its potential to uncover hidden players in disease pathways. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for clustering complex traits, identifying therapeutic targets, and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach promises to enhance our mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and inform the development of precision medicine strategies.",

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.",

          "paragraph": "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

          "output": "While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression remains underexplored. This gap hinders the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully highlights critical genes that lack direct associations with traits but are implicated in disease-relevant pathways, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for clustering complex traits, uncovering disease etiology, and identifying potential therapeutic targets, thereby offering valuable insights for drug repurposing and the advancement of functional genomics.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: {{ paragraph }}\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a shared latent space with pharmacological data. This method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling a comprehensive analysis of complex traits. Our results demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug mechanisms, potentially transforming functional genomics and precision medicine.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method shows proficiency in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations, yet functionally significant, are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a unified latent space, facilitating the analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations. By analyzing modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic associations by integrating co-expression data, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This framework offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the advancement of functional genomics and precision medicine.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic associations and pharmacological data within a unified latent space. By analyzing modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, PhenoPLIER effectively links diseases to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers drugs' mechanisms of action. Our findings include the prioritization of functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by highlighting the broader significance of gene co-expression networks, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis.

Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell types.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating the analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights functionally important genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits by integrating co-expression information, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This novel framework offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the discovery of drug mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the collective information of co-expressed gene groups to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Our method relies on the identification of gene modules with coherent expression profiles across various conditions, enabling the integration of complex trait associations with drug response data. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as validated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression networks. It offers a powerful framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis, thereby contributing to the precision medicine paradigm.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages gene co-expression modules to capture the collective behavior of genes across various conditions, providing mechanistic insights into complex trait regulation. Our findings demonstrate that disease states are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic associations by emphasizing the importance of gene networks, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies might overlook. This framework has broad implications for the clustering of complex traits and the discovery of drug mechanisms, propelling the field of functional genomics forward.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

              "text": "Understanding the interplay between genes and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets, yet current genetic studies often overlook the intricate gene-gene interactions that underpin disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene contributions to disease, they fall short in capturing the collective influence of gene networks. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data within a unified latent space, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our method leverages the co-expression of gene clusters across various conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights functionally important genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis, offering a powerful framework that contextualizes genetic associations within gene networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets and informing drug repurposing strategies. This approach promises to refine our understanding of complex trait clustering and propel functional genomics research forward.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease progression remains elusive. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This model leverages gene co-expression modules, capturing the coordinated activity of genes across various conditions, to provide mechanistic insights into complex trait associations. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action, with diseases showing significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach promises to advance the clustering of complex traits and facilitate the discovery of novel drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              "text": "Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current approaches often overlook the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes, they fall short in capturing the intricate interplay between genes that contributes to disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations with diseases in relevant cell types and accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also identifies key regulatory genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This framework paves the way for drug repurposing and the discovery of drug mechanisms, offering a powerful tool for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes under similar conditions, enabling the dissection of complex trait architectures. Our findings demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of our method. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach represents a significant stride in functional genomics, offering a robust framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease traits are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are integral to trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a powerful tool to contextualize genetic associations, thereby highlighting disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional methods. This advancement has broad implications for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, propelling the field towards more targeted and effective interventions.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We provide evidence that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for contextualizing genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook, and thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

However, a comprehensive method to link gene co-expression patterns to disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains elusive. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages gene expression data to project genetic associations onto networks of co-expressed genes, or gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER successfully contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This framework advances our ability to interpret complex genetic data and holds promise for identifying novel drug repurposing opportunities and clustering complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease traits are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are nevertheless prioritized within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a powerful tool to contextualize genetic associations, thereby highlighting disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional methods. This framework has broad implications for enhancing our understanding of complex traits and streamlining the drug discovery process.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This study addresses the gap by leveraging gene co-expression to elucidate the genetic basis of diseases and identify potential drug targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene expression profiles with genetic associations to identify disease-relevant gene modules and predict drug-disease relationships. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also highlighting functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in disease through co-expression networks. By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation as a case study, we showcase the ability of PhenoPLIER to prioritize trait-associated genes that traditional single-gene approaches might miss. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology by contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules but also offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This framework is constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions.

              "text": "Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current models lack a comprehensive approach to elucidate gene-gene interactions and their implications in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short in addressing the collective influence of gene networks. To bridge this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating the analysis of co-expressed gene modules under various conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules active in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that key regulatory genes, although not directly associated with traits, are identified within trait-associated modules. This study not only enhances our understanding of the genetic basis of diseases but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current models inadequately capture the essence of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short in addressing the collective influence of gene networks. To bridge this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating the simultaneous analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our results demonstrate that these modules, which consist of genes with correlated expression patterns in relevant cell types, are significantly associated with disease phenotypes. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also reveals potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations with traits, are implicated in disease-relevant pathways, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation. This study not only enhances our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to the precision medicine paradigm.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This gap in knowledge underscores the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions to develop effective therapies. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes under similar conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex traits but also offers a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This gap hinders the development of new therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. By integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where diseases and drugs converge on shared gene expression modules, revealing the cellular contexts in which these associations are significant. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into drug mechanisms of action. Notably, in a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER successfully prioritized key regulatory genes that lacked direct associations, underscoring its potential to uncover hidden players in disease pathways. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for clustering complex traits, identifying therapeutic targets, and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach promises to enhance our mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and inform the development of precision medicine strategies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression remains underexplored. This gap hinders the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully highlights critical genes that lack direct associations with traits but are implicated in disease-relevant pathways, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for clustering complex traits, uncovering disease etiology, and identifying potential therapeutic targets, thereby offering valuable insights for drug repurposing and the advancement of functional genomics.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."
