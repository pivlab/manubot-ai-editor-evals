          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This understanding is pivotal for the development
          of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and

          computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations and

          regulation revealed that functionally significant players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, contextualizing them, and uncovering potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach advances
          our understanding of genetic associations through the lens of gene

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and progression.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          revealed that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, thereby unveiling potential targets overlooked
          by single-gene strategies and advancing our understanding of gene
          modules in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal.
          However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these
          interactions and their implications for disease and drug mechanisms.
          To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal.
          However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these
          interactions and their implications for disease mechanisms and drug
          development. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing a
          more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential
          therapeutic targets. This approach advances the field by highlighting
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies and offers a
          promising avenue for drug repurposing.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal.
          However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these
          interactions and their implications for disease and therapy
          development. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, advancing the field of functional
          genomics.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a

          synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding how they
          influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of
          expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the creation of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in

          offers a novel approach for interpreting genetic associations through

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic
          strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to
          disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that functionally significant players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, offering insights into potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in disease
          progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their regulation across different conditions. To address this, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, and advancing our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic
          strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in
          disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that functionally significant players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, offering insights into potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic
          strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in
          disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked
          to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals
          that functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, provides
          a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations, offering
          insights into potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based

          interpreting genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and
          revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This approach advances our understanding of complex trait
          clustering and offers new avenues for drug repurposing.

          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial
          for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the
          context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses
          this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We developed a
          novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results,
          including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
          functionally important players, often overlooked in single-gene
          strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach
          has broader implications for genetic studies, potentially
          revolutionizing the identification of therapeutic targets and
          facilitating drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial,
          yet challenging. This knowledge gap hinders the development of new
          therapies, as it is essential to identify disease-associated gene
          modules and predict drug-disease pairs accurately. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that leverages gene
          co-expression to contextualize genetic associations. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important players, although lacking
          direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement
          in interpreting genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic
          targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
          approach could revolutionize the field of genetic studies, paving the
          way for more effective drug repurposing and the identification of
          novel therapeutic targets.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating the
          significant association of diseases with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, reveal that functionally important players, often
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic
          targets and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates
          that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial,
          yet challenging. This knowledge gap hinders the development of new
          therapies, as it limits our ability to accurately predict drug-disease
          pairs and infer mechanisms of action. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to contextualize genetic associations. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs. Furthermore, our CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          important players, often overlooked by single-gene strategies, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only fills the existing gap in interpreting genetic
          associations, but also uncovers potential therapeutic targets, thereby
          advancing the field of functional genomics and paving the way for
          effective drug repurposing and development.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates
          that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial
          for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the
          context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses
          this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We introduce a
          novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results,
          including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
          functionally important players, often overlooked in single-gene
          strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach
          has broader implications for genetic studies, therapeutic target
          identification, and drug repurposing.

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation

          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The complex interplay of genes and their role in disease etiology and
          progression remains a significant gap in our understanding, despite
          advances in transcriptome-wide association studies. These studies have
          elucidated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but the
          predicted importance of gene-gene interactions in the architecture of
          complex traits is yet to be fully explored. To address this, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Notably,
          our application of PhenoPLIER in a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          revealed that functionally important players, although lacking direct
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. This study,
          therefore, not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology but
          also provides a robust tool for identifying potential therapeutic
          targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the
          field of functional genomics.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are critical in the onset and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs

          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
          the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
          genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          vital in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for a combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The complex interplay of genes and their role in disease etiology and
          progression remains a significant gap in our understanding, despite
          advances in transcriptome-wide association studies. These studies have
          elucidated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but the
          predicted importance of gene-gene interactions in the architecture of
          complex traits is yet to be fully explored. To address this, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important
          players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This research not only fills a
          critical gap in understanding gene-gene interactions in disease
          progression but also provides a robust tool for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby
          advancing the field of functional genomics.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the
          regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across different conditions.
          To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings
          reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
          important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only
          enhance our understanding of disease etiology but also provide a novel
          approach for identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the field of genetic
          studies.

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Genes function in specific contexts through coordinated interactions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          essential to comprehend the regulation of gene expression across
          varying conditions. This understanding is pivotal for the development
          of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          critical in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the perspective of gene modules.

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in
              the context of disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to
              effectively map these interactions and their implications for
              disease and drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation. This representation is based on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
              lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, advancing the field of functional
              genomics.

              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to
              effectively map these interactions and their implications for
              disease mechanisms and drug development. To address this, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally important players, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of
              disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets. This approach
              advances the field by highlighting potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies and offers a promising avenue for drug
              repurposing.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a
              comprehensive grasp of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is vital for the creation of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
              on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
              However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We note that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally important players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in
              disease progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for
              drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new
              therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes
              in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              integral to disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed
              in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic
              associations, offering insights into potential targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. Genes function synergistically within
              specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions.
              We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals
              that functionally significant genes, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, offering insights into potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their regulation across different
              conditions. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. Genes function synergistically within
              specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are critical in disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              reveals that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, offering insights into potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated

              interpreting genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology,
              and revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This approach advances our understanding
              of complex trait clustering and offers new avenues for drug
              repurposing.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in
              our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation,
              particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. We developed a novel approach, PhenoPLIER,
              which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally important
              players, often overlooked in single-gene strategies, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
              highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This
              approach has broader implications for genetic studies, potentially
              revolutionizing the identification of therapeutic targets and
              facilitating drug repurposing.

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge
              is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              findings indicate a significant association between diseases and
              gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial, yet challenging. This knowledge gap hinders the
              development of new therapies, as it is essential to identify
              disease-associated gene modules and predict drug-disease pairs
              accurately. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              framework that leverages gene co-expression to contextualize
              genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a

              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
              functionally important players, often overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets and
              advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial, yet challenging. This knowledge gap hinders the
              development of new therapies, as it limits our ability to
              accurately predict drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of

              that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize
              genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

              thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and paving the

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits across different conditions

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are vital in disease onset and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly linked with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,

              The complex interplay of genes and their role in disease etiology
              and progression remains a significant gap in our understanding,
              despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies. These
              studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, but the predicted importance of gene-gene interactions
              in the architecture of complex traits is yet to be fully explored.
              To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent

              our understanding of disease etiology but also provides a robust
              tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the field of

              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are vital in the onset and progression
              of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a
              combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of

              The complex interplay of genes and their role in disease etiology
              and progression remains a significant gap in our understanding,
              despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies. These
              studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, but the predicted importance of gene-gene interactions
              in the architecture of complex traits is yet to be fully explored.
              To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent

              patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that
              functionally important players, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This research not only fills a critical gap in
              understanding gene-gene interactions in disease progression but
              also provides a robust tool for identifying potential therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease onset and progression. This highlights a gap in our
              understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
              across different conditions. To address this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
              important genes, although lacking direct associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings not only enhance our understanding of disease etiology
              but also provide a novel approach for identifying potential
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby
              advancing the field of genetic studies.

              Genes function in specific contexts through coordinated
              interactions. To understand how these genes influence complex
              traits, it is essential to comprehend the regulation of gene
              expression across varying conditions. This understanding is
              pivotal for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are critical in the onset and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for combined analysis. This representation is
              founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              under identical conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR

              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
