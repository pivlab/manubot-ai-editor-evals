Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "The study of complex traits relies on a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, they fail to account for gene interactions and their impact on complex diseases (e.g., drug repurposing). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our findings highlight that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides insights into the functional significance of co-expressed genes, contributing to the broader field of gene expression analysis in complex diseases (e.g., drug repurposing)."

Recent studies have demonstrated that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nWe introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations into common latent representations for joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant association with diseases involving specific cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, prioritizing functionally important players within trait-associated gene modules through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes using PhenoPLIER, genetic associations can be contextualized and potential targets missed by single-gene strategies can be revealed. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations provides valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, offering a promising avenue for therapeutic repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the study of complex traits, genes interact and perform functions in concert with each other across specific contexts. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation is crucial for developing new therapies, yet our knowledge of gene-gene interactions in disease origin remains limited. Recent models predict a significant role for such interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. \n\nPhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and these modules. Our results demonstrate accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and uncover mechanisms of action by inferring interactions among disease-associated gene modules. Furthermore, analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. \n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing these associations, PhenoPLIER can reveal untapped therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and contribute to advancing drug repurposing efforts in complex diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for elucidating complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. However, current approaches are limited in capturing the full extent of interactions between genes due to a lack of comprehensive analysis methods. This study aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nPhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions to identify disease-associated gene networks and potential therapeutic targets. The method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action in various diseases. Furthermore, it identifies functionally important players that are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when lacking associations themselves.\n\nBy incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and contextualizing them within the context of gene modules. This approach expands our understanding of complex diseases and opens up new opportunities for drug repurposing by highlighting previously unexplored therapeutic targets."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

PhenoPLIER addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach identifies modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, highlighting potential targets for drug repurposing. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these modules, and our predictions accurately identify known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, by using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lacking associations. In conclusion, the contextualization of genetic associations through gene modules can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic studies."

In recent years, functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding of complex traits by elucidating the intricate relationships between genes and their functions in concert with each other. However, a mechanistic understanding of these interactions is critical for developing new therapies, given that transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms but fail to account for gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER—a computational approach mapping gene-trait associations into a common latent representation for joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types while accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules, demonstrating its potential for uncovering novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, this work provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression patterns and highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": "We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach that unravels the complex interplay between genetic associations and gene expression patterns for a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology. By integrating pharmacological perturbation data with gene-trait associations, we establish a common latent representation to explore functional genomics across different contexts. Our study emphasizes how genes collaborate in concert to perform their functions, emphasizing the importance of elucidating these intricate relationships to advance therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have indeed shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that genetic interactions are essential for complex trait origins and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's methodology is predicated upon identifying modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, thereby emphasizing the importance of understanding coordinated gene regulation. Our findings reveal substantial associations between diseases and specific cell types characterized by co-expressed gene clusters. Remarkably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, as well as inferring mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility in identifying novel regulatory targets through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation. Our results underscore the value of integrating multiple genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER serves as an innovative framework for interpreting complex genetic relationships via gene modules, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and identifying novel therapeutic opportunities."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes function in concert with each other across diverse contexts to perform their functions, highlighting the importance of understanding expression regulation in complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER employs modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across conditions to project genetic associations into a molecular context. We demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed within relevant cell types using known drug-disease pairs, providing insights into therapeutic mechanisms. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis reveals that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, despite lacking direct associations. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By utilizing the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for drug repurposing efforts and provides a powerful tool in functional genomics research."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

The collaborative function of genes in specific contexts is essential for understanding complex traits and developing new therapies. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play an indispensable part in determining disease origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative approach relies on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, demonstrating significant associations between diseases and these cell type-specific modules. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action based on transcriptomic data. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of groups of co-expressed genes into our computational framework contextualizes genetic associations and unveils potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits through gene module analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to drug repurposing and disease etiology interpretation."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

By exploring gene co-expression patterns across different conditions, our method uncovers mechanistic insights essential for devising novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable information on the role of individual genes in disease processes; however, modern models suggest that complex traits are significantly influenced by gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's unique approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes and their relevance to specific conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations between diseases and these gene modules while accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.\n\nUsing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. This finding highlights the potential of our approach to contextualize genetic associations and reveal therapeutic targets missed through single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations within the context of gene co-expression patterns and functional networks. By doing so, this study significantly advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms while paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions in complex disorders."

          "output": "We present PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach that unlocks the complex interplay between genetic associations and disease etiology by translating gene expression patterns into a unified latent representation. Understanding how genes collaborate to modulate intricate traits requires a comprehensive evaluation of their regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions. While single-gene studies have shed light on individual roles in disease processes, modern models predict that gene interactions play an essential role in complex trait origins and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER constructs modules consisting of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions, revealing the profound connection between diseases and specific cell types. Our approach adeptly identifies known drug-disease pairs and elucidates therapeutic mechanisms by predicting disease etiology with remarkable accuracy. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally significant players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack associations themselves.\n\nIn summary, utilizing gene co-expression patterns enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. This innovative framework paves the way for a deeper comprehension of complex traits through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": "Gene expression is a complex interplay of genes working together, and understanding their roles in determining complex traits demands elucidating the mechanisms governing gene regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies, as our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and revealing underlying mechanisms of action. By employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important genes lack associations but remain prioritized within trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER. This novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed in single-gene approaches. Overall, our findings suggest that integrating gene module analyses can enhance the interpretation and application of genetic studies for drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

In this context, our research aims to project genetic associations through co-expressed genes, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We developed PhenoPLIER—an approach that clusters complex trait-associated gene modules—to address the gap of missing mechanistic understanding in genetic studies.\n\nUsing functional genomics datasets, we demonstrate accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and infer new therapeutic targets via our method. Furthermore, analyzing a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation using PhenoPLIER, we find that key players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, providing novel insights into the mechanism of action for these drugs.\n\nIn conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER, our research highlights missed targets from single-gene strategies and advances drug repurposing efforts through a better understanding of complex disease etiology. This study thus provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, highlighting how this approach could significantly impact the field by bridging functional genomics with therapeutic target discovery."

This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. In this study, we reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. Thus, integrating groups of co-expressed genes using PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.

To understand how these genes contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing novel therapies (context). Our research presents an innovative approach called PhenoPLIER that utilizes co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations by identifying groups of functionally related genes (content). We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action, using both CRISPR screening and a lipid regulation model (results). Moreover, we reveal that functional players in trait-associated modules lack associations but are prioritized within these gene networks. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed genes, highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and advancing the field of drug repurposing (broader significance)."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Gene co-expression plays a crucial role in complex trait regulation, wherein multiple genes work together to perform their functions. To gain insights into the genetic basis of diseases and develop effective therapies, it is essential to understand gene expression patterns across different cellular contexts. Our research highlights that significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules are projected through these co-expression patterns. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates underlying mechanisms for therapeutic interventions.\n\nUtilizing a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally crucial players in this process lack associations with disease traits but still hold importance within the context of trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER. This novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes and uncovers potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches. In conclusion, our findings emphasize that PhenoPLIER can be a valuable tool for drug repurposing efforts by revealing the complex interplay between genetic associations and gene expression patterns in various diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for elucidating complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms. However, identifying key genes involved in various diseases has been challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive approach that can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. \n\nIn this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to analyze various disease datasets, successfully predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players in trait-associated modules that lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential for PhenoPLIER to revolutionize drug repurposing efforts by providing novel therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of complex diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, by utilizing gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing personalized medicine."

          "output": "Genetic studies aim to understand the underlying mechanisms of complex traits and diseases by investigating gene-gene interactions. However, functional genomic approaches are limited in predicting drug targets for specific conditions due to their inability to capture gene co-expression patterns across diverse cell types. This gap is crucial as understanding these associations could lead to more precise therapies, enhancing treatment outcomes. \n\nTo address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel method that utilizes gene module expressions in relevant cell populations. By applying the technique to known drug-disease pairs and analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, our results highlight accurate predictions of disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms. Moreover, functionally important players are prioritized within trait-associated modules despite lacking associations, providing new insights into genetic studies' limitations.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene module co-expression patterns. This approach fills the gap in functional genomic research by contextualizing complex disease traits and unveiling potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, contributing to drug repurposing efforts and advancing our understanding of genetic association mechanisms."

Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by the proposed approach.\n\nIn conclusion, our study not only expands upon the existing literature on functional genomics and gene co-expression for drug repurposing but also highlights novel therapeutic targets through a more precise understanding of disease etiology."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

To gain a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER, a computational approach introduced here, maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing insights into diseases' association with specific cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nUtilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and therapeutic targets, demonstrating the potential for drug repurposing strategies through a better understanding of complex traits' underlying mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This insight is vital for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in both disease etiology and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER – a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations between diseases and trait-associated gene modules while accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Utilizing CRISPR screening techniques for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations with these traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression.\n\nWe introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to analyze complex traits with significant association to disease mechanisms in various cell types.\n\nPhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating drug action mechanisms was validated using a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our results demonstrate that functionally important players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, indicating its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs for treating complex diseases."

However, current methods mainly focus on individual gene associations and overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules. Moreover, it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action in various biological processes. To further validate PhenoPLIER's significance, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by the proposed method. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only contributes to our understanding of complex traits but also offers promising avenues for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery."

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, they fail to account for gene interactions and their impact on complex diseases (e.g., drug repurposing). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our findings highlight that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides insights into the functional significance of co-expressed genes, contributing to the broader field of gene expression analysis in complex diseases (e.g., drug repurposing).",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

In recent years, functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding of complex traits by elucidating the intricate relationships between genes and their functions in concert with each other. However, a mechanistic understanding of these interactions is critical for developing new therapies, given that transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms but fail to account for gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER—a computational approach mapping gene-trait associations into a common latent representation for joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types while accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules, demonstrating its potential for uncovering novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, this work provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression patterns and highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis reveals that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, despite lacking direct associations. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By utilizing the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for drug repurposing efforts and provides a powerful tool in functional genomics research.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

By exploring gene co-expression patterns across different conditions, our method uncovers mechanistic insights essential for devising novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable information on the role of individual genes in disease processes; however, modern models suggest that complex traits are significantly influenced by gene-gene interactions.

This finding highlights the potential of our approach to contextualize genetic associations and reveal therapeutic targets missed through single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations within the context of gene co-expression patterns and functional networks.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

It integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our findings demonstrate that understanding complex traits' expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies by highlighting how genes interact together in concerted efforts. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in determining the origin and progression of complex traits.\n\nWe present that diseases are significantly associated with specific modules of co-expressed genes expressed across relevant cell types using transcriptomic data from various conditions. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Furthermore, we validate our findings through a CRISPR screen in lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential drug repurposing opportunities by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. This study establishes a significant contribution to functional genomics research, providing new insights into disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms while moving the broader field forward.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies, as our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and revealing underlying mechanisms of action. By employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important genes lack associations but remain prioritized within trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

To understand how these genes contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing novel therapies (context). Our research presents an innovative approach called PhenoPLIER that utilizes co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations by identifying groups of functionally related genes (content). We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action, using both CRISPR screening and a lipid regulation model (results). Moreover, we reveal that functional players in trait-associated modules lack associations but are prioritized within these gene networks. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed genes, highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and advancing the field of drug repurposing (broader significance).",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, identifying key genes involved in various diseases has been challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive approach that can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. \n\nIn this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to analyze various disease datasets, successfully predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players in trait-associated modules that lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential for PhenoPLIER to revolutionize drug repurposing efforts by providing novel therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of complex diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, by utilizing gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing personalized medicine.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, functional genomic approaches are limited in predicting drug targets for specific conditions due to their inability to capture gene co-expression patterns across diverse cell types. This gap is crucial as understanding these associations could lead to more precise therapies, enhancing treatment outcomes. \n\nTo address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel method that utilizes gene module expressions in relevant cell populations. By applying the technique to known drug-disease pairs and analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, our results highlight accurate predictions of disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms. Moreover, functionally important players are prioritized within trait-associated modules despite lacking associations, providing new insights into genetic studies' limitations.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene module co-expression patterns. This approach fills the gap in functional genomic research by contextualizing complex disease traits and unveiling potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, contributing to drug repurposing efforts and advancing our understanding of genetic association mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

To uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial. This insight has been shown to be vital for developing new therapeutic strategies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in determining the origins and progression of diseases.\n\nIn this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach aimed at mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The methodology is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that disease severity is significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by the proposed approach.\n\nIn conclusion, our study not only expands upon the existing literature on functional genomics and gene co-expression for drug repurposing but also highlights novel therapeutic targets through a more precise understanding of disease etiology.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Despite advancements, transcriptome-wide association studies have limitations in capturing gene-gene interactions and disease etiology due to their focus on individual genes. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in complex trait origins and progression.\n\nWe introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational method mapping gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach highlights disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, providing insights into mechanisms of action.\n\nAdditionally, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation. These findings significantly expand our understanding of complex traits, disease etiology, and therapeutic targets, highlighting the potential for drug repurposing to treat a wide range of conditions.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "Complex traits are shaped by the coordinated expression of multiple genes, and understanding these interactions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, current methods mainly focus on individual gene associations and overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules. Moreover, it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action in various biological processes. To further validate PhenoPLIER's significance, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by the proposed method. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only contributes to our understanding of complex traits but also offers promising avenues for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
