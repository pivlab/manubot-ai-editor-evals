A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential for developing new therapies, as it aids in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms via transcriptome-wide association studies. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key drivers of complex traits and disease progression.

To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This model is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to identify significant relationships between diseases and specific cell types as well as accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

Moreover, using a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER even if they lack associations themselves. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes through the use of PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting complex traits via gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00) Gene co-expression plays a crucial role in determining complex traits, as individual genes function together to perform their functions.

Additionally, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes, highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. By leveraging gene co-expression patterns across different conditions, we can elucidate how genes work together in concert to perform their functions. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies that target complex traits' underlying mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in disease-relevant pathways; however, modern models predict that genetic interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of diseases.

PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions associated with specific complex traits, such as diseases. We demonstrate that these module-based associations are significantly related to known drug-disease pairs and can accurately infer mechanisms of action for existing therapies. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players in trait-associated modules lack associations but remain prioritized by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression patterns and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies for drug repurposing. Our approach offers a novel framework to interpret complex genetic traits and disease etiology by identifying functional modules with shared expression characteristics in diverse cellular contexts.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

In this study, we fill a gap in the literature by introducing PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By determining how genes act together to perform their functions, our method requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. We highlight that this insight is essential for developing new therapies by utilizing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. 

We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER's prediction for known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. 

In conclusion, our approach contextualizes genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential targets missed in single-gene strategies and providing a novel framework for interpreting complex traits. By incorporating these insights into drug repurposing and development, we move the broader field forward by expanding therapeutic possibilities and elucidating disease etiology.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

Genes collaborate to execute their functions, with intricate interplay between co-expressed genes driving complex traits. To decipher the underlying mechanisms of gene expression regulation in diverse contexts, it is crucial to elucidate how these genes contribute to disease etiology and drug efficacy. Our research demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed within relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and providing mechanistic insights into therapeutic targets. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we reveal the functional importance of key players missing associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER. This approach contextualizes genetic associations, identifying potential missed targets using groups of co-expressed genes.

By mapping gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, we reveal disease relationships in distinct modules of co-expressed genes. Our results indicate significant association of these gene modules with specific diseases, demonstrating our ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

Furthermore, through the use of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. These findings not only shed light on new therapeutic targets but also underscore the power of our approach in advancing functional genomics and drug repurposing. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to project gene expression patterns across complex traits highlights critical disease etiology and facilitates novel drug mechanisms, underscoring its potential impact on future research in this field.</td>
