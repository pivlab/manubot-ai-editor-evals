Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to understand genetic associations.

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and show accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action using this approach.

Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a promising avenue for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.">[PASS] (1.00) Genes interact in concert with one another to perform their functions, and determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
