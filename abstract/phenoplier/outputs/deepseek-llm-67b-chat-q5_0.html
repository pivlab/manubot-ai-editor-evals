To understand how these genes influence complex traits, we need a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of diseases. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00) Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.

PhenoPLIER is a computational method that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes operate in unison to perform their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions to discern how they influence complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to the identification of individual genes implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models posit that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in the onset and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen used to examine lipid regulation reveals functionally crucial players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in specific contexts, requiring a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
