Genes play critical roles in complex traits, and understanding how they interact with each other is essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and observe that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and developing new therapies.">[PASS] (1.00)

The role of genes in complex traits cannot be fully understood by examining their individual functions; rather, they work together to achieve specific outcomes in particular contexts.

Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the etiology and mechanisms of complex traits. However, these studies often focus on single genes, which can lead to missing critical interactions between genes and their contribution to disease. In this study, we aimed to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. Using functional genomics techniques, we identified gene modules that were differentially expressed in relevant cell types across various conditions. Our results showed that diseases were significantly associated with these gene modules, and our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>
