Genes work in concert with each other to carry out their functions within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease onset and progression. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.">[PASS] (1.00)

Genetic studies and functional genomics have revolutionized the field of disease etiology, but they face a major challenge in understanding how genes interact with each other to contribute to complex traits. Gene co-expression has been shown to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, and recent advances in transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these approaches often neglect gene-gene interactions, which can obscure potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and can contextualize genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizing functionally important players that lack associations but are enriched in trait-associated modules. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

By leveraging functional genomics and gene co-expression, we found that diseases are significantly associated with specific groups of genes expressed in relevant cell types.

The field of genetics has long known that genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions. However, determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. The accuracy and relevance of this understanding is critical for developing new therapies.

Our study aims to address the gap in understanding complex diseases and drug mechanisms by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. In recent years, functional genomics has enabled researchers to identify genes that play a role in disease development and progression. However, this approach lacks the ability to contextualize these findings and provide insights into how these genes interact with each other and with environmental factors. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel method called PhenoPLIER, which clusters genes based on their expression patterns across different conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By providing a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER can facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts. Our approach has broader significance by enabling researchers to better understand the complex interplay between genes and environmental factors in disease development and progression.">[FAIL] (0.78) Python code returned false

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the field of functional genomics, with the aim of understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits. However, despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, it remains challenging to identify the specific genetic mechanisms underlying disease development. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to capture the complex relationships between genes and traits in a more comprehensive manner.

We have applied PhenoPLIER to a large dataset of gene expression profiles and disease phenotypes, and found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We also observed that our approach is highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we have used PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules based on their expression patterns.

Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene modules in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By leveraging functional genomics data and computational tools, we have uncovered novel insights into the complex relationships between genes and traits, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches and precision medicine strategies.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false
