          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts
          to perform their functions is crucial for identifying the genetic
          factors involved in complex traits. Gene-gene interactions have been
          shown to be critical for disease origin and progression, but
          traditional methods of analyzing gene expression data have limitations
          in identifying these interactions. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines transcriptome-wide
          association studies and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach uses
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions to map gene-trait associations, enabling us to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action, and we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation to
          further validate our approach. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which has important
          implications for drug repurposing and the development of new
          therapies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene
          interactions in complex trait analysis and provide a valuable resource
          for researchers working in this field.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Complex traits are the result of interactions between multiple genes,
          and determining how these genes influence these traits requires an
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
          individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern

          Genes play a complex and interdependent role in the functioning of
          organisms. Understanding how these genes influence disease and
          therapeutic responses requires an understanding of expression
          regulation across different contexts. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped identify individual genes associated
          with disease, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions are
          crucial in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene
          expression patterns, pharmacological perturbation data, and trait
          associations into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
          By clustering genes with similar expression profiles across the same
          conditions, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, using CRISPR screening, we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
          and can contextualize single-gene strategies in complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed

          The study of genes and their interactions in disease development is a
          crucial aspect of modern medical research. However, the complexity of
          these interactions has made it difficult to identify specific genes
          that are responsible for certain diseases. Recent advances in
          functional genomics and transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on this issue by providing new insights into gene
          expression patterns and their associations with disease etiology.
          However, these approaches often rely on single-gene analyses, which
          can miss the broader picture of how groups of co-expressed genes
          interact to contribute to complex traits.


          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering groups of
          co-expressed genes in the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER can help
          identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach has significant implications for future therapeutic
          development and may lead to new insights into the underlying causes of
          complex diseases. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of
          integrating functional genomics and gene expression data to better
          understand disease mechanisms and identify new drug targets.

          Genes work in harmony with each other within specific contexts to
          perform their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to
          complex traits requires a deeper understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for
          developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped identify individual genes associated with

          Genetic studies have long been a crucial tool in understanding disease

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Gene expression patterns are critical in determining how genes
          function together to produce complex traits. However, uncovering the
          underlying mechanisms of disease-relevant mechanisms has been a
          challenge for genetic studies. Modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression,
          but transcriptome-wide association studies have not fully captured
          this complexity. To overcome this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings
          suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Complex traits, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, are
          influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. Traditional
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease etiology and progression. Therefore, there is a need to
          develop computational approaches that can map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for
          joint analysis.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          In addition to disease associations, we applied PhenoPLIER to analyze
          lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. We found that functionally
          important players lack associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which is
          crucial for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs in
          complex diseases. Our approach can be used to map genetic associations
          onto disease etiology and progression mechanisms, enabling the
          discovery of new drug candidates for complex diseases.

          In the complex world of gene regulation, individual genes work in
          concert with each other to perform their functions. However,
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed analysis of expression regulation across various conditions.
          Such insights are critical for developing new therapies that can
          target specific disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in identifying single gene
          associations with diseases, the modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Complex traits such as diseases are determined by the concerted
          activity of multiple genes, which makes their functional genomics a
          challenging task. Gene co-expression analysis has emerged as a
          promising approach for understanding disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which poses a
          significant challenge to the current single-gene strategies. To
          overcome this limitation, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene expression patterns, pharmacological
          perturbation data, and gene-trait associations into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Our analysis revealed that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease
          pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen, we identified functionally important players that lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          enabling us to contextualize gene expression patterns and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings
          highlight the importance of functional genomics in uncovering disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide insights into the
          development of new therapeutic targets.

          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological

          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent space for joint analysis. Genes work together in specific
          contexts to perform their functions, making it crucial to understand
          expression regulation across different conditions to determine how
          genes influence complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped identify individual gene roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are critical in disease etiology and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are associated with relevant cell type-expressed gene modules, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In
          summary, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics
          by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We
          address the challenge of understanding how genes work together in
          specific contexts to perform their functions, which is critical for
          developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important players lacking associations but included in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by contextualizing genetic
          associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms.
          Our approach has broader significance as it facilitates the discovery
          of therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and informs
          drug repurposing efforts.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to
          create a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often
          act synergistically in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires an
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          which has been critical in developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease
          origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on
          modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          groups of co-expressed genes for contextualizing genetic associations
          and identifying potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic

          Context: Genetic studies have long sought to understand the role of
          specific genes in disease etiology, but modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease progression.
          Functional genomics has helped uncover these complex relationships,
          but identifying key players and mechanisms is challenging. The task of
          determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          which can inform new therapeutic strategies.


          Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions and can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and
          infer mechanisms of action. We applied our approach to lipid
          regulation using a CRISPR screen, revealing that functionally
          important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules despite
          lacking associations.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which has broader significance in drug discovery and
          repurposing. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of
          considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and therapeutic
          target identification.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links
          gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach recognizes the
          importance of gene regulation in specific contexts and utilizes
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions to map complex traits. By leveraging functional genomics
          techniques, we identify significant disease associations with
          trait-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Our recent CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrates the importance of functionally important
          players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, opening up new
          avenues for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

          In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics has emerged as a
          powerful tool for understanding complex traits and disease mechanisms.
          Gene co-expression analysis provides valuable insights into the
          molecular pathways involved in various diseases, but identifying
          therapeutic targets based on individual genes can be challenging due
          to the lack of a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. To address this gap, we developed
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. By utilizing modules of genes with

          Genetic studies have identified numerous associations with complex
          traits, but the underlying mechanisms of these associations are not
          fully understood. To address this challenge, we developed a novel
          approach that leverages functional genomics to identify gene
          co-expression patterns associated with disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we used a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players
          lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of contextualizing
          genetic associations through gene module analysis, which can reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our study
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          identifying therapeutic targets through gene modules.

          functions. However, determining the influence of these genes on
          complex traits is challenging due to expression regulation across
          different conditions. The development of new therapies for diseases
          relies on this insight. Our research shows that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. We also show that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, our approach PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
          providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The interplay between genes is essential for their functioning.
          However, understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a deeper comprehension of expression regulation across
          distinct conditions. Our research demonstrates that this insight is
          vital in developing new therapies. Our findings reveal that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

          missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have identified numerous
          disease-associated genetic variants, but their functional significance
          is often unclear. To address this gap in the literature, our study
          used gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential drug targets. We applied a novel approach
          called PhenoPLIER, which clustered genes based on their expression
          profiles across multiple cell types and conditions. Our results showed
          that diseases were significantly associated with specific modules of
          co-expressed genes in relevant cell types, and we used this
          information to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, we analyzed lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen and found that functionally important players lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of
          PhenoPLIER to provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which may lead to new
          therapeutic targets and improved drug repurposing strategies.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Complex traits are influenced by the interplay of multiple genes, but
          determining how these genes interact in different contexts to perform
          their functions is a challenging task. While this knowledge is crucial
          for developing new therapies, current approaches often fail to provide
          a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Our study addresses this gap by utilizing gene
          co-expression analysis to identify disease-associated gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. We show that our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, providing valuable insights into the etiology
          and drug mechanisms underlying complex traits.


          To further contextualize genetic associations, we used a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and identified functionally important
          players that lacked associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the
          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, our
          study highlights the importance of incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes to better understand complex traits and develop new
          therapeutic strategies.

          The study of genes and their interactions has been critical in
          understanding the etiology of complex diseases. However, determining
          how these genes act together to produce disease outcomes requires a
          more comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns across
          different conditions. In this manuscript, we present a novel approach
          that utilizes functional genomics and clustering techniques to
          identify gene modules associated with specific traits and diseases.
          Our results show that by grouping co-expressed genes, our method can
          accurately predict drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of this approach through a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, where we identified
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study
          highlights the importance of gene co-expression in contextualizing
          genetic associations and revealing potential drug targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of functional genomics, which may have
          broader implications in drug discovery and disease treatment.

          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In this study, we present a novel approach to understanding the
          interplay of genes in specific contexts and their impact on complex
          traits. We utilized functional genomics data to identify gene modules
          associated with diseases and drug mechanisms, providing insights into
          disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets. Our results
          demonstrate that these gene modules are highly accurate predictors of
          known drug-disease pairs and reveal underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          found that important players lacked associations but were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the
          importance of considering groups of co-expressed genes when
          interpreting genetic associations, as this can contextualize and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, with applications in
          drug discovery and disease understanding.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in the development and
          progression of complex traits, including diseases. However,
          understanding how genes interact with each other to influence these
          traits is a challenging task that requires a comprehensive approach.
          Our study addresses this challenge by applying functional genomics
          techniques to identify gene modules associated with specific diseases
          and cell types. We developed a novel method called PhenoPLIER that can
          accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER was
          able to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

          Genes function in a coordinated manner with each other in specific

          determining how these genes influence complex traits and developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The study of disease etiology and drug mechanisms requires a
          comprehensive understanding of gene expression patterns. While
          individual genes have been shown to play a role in disease, recent
          models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical for the
          development and progression of complex traits. To address this gap in
          the literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation. This allows for a joint analysis
          of gene expression patterns across different conditions. We found that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER, even if they lacked direct associations.
          Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene co-expression in
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          The present study demonstrates the importance of understanding gene
          expression regulation in complex traits and their role in disease
          etiology. Utilizing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation, we show that diseases are associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our

          regulation reveals that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the
          role of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for drug

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have identified many genes
          associated with disease, but determining the underlying mechanisms of
          disease is a complex task. Gene co-expression analysis has shown that
          genes work together to regulate expression patterns across different
          conditions. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this

          The coordinated action of genes in specific contexts is essential for
          their functioning. Understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits requires an insight into the regulation of expression across
          different conditions. The role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms has been uncovered through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions

          mechanisms and provide insights into therapeutic targets and drug

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of complex
          traits and disease mechanisms. However, individual gene associations
          with complex traits only provide a partial picture of the underlying
          molecular processes. To bridge this gap, functional genomics
          techniques are increasingly being used to study gene expression
          patterns across different conditions. These studies reveal that genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts, making it
          critical to understand how they influence complex traits. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our
          approach reveals significant disease associations with specific cell
          types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms
          of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential for drug repurposing and
          therapeutic target discovery. Overall, our work provides a powerful
          tool for identifying new disease biomarkers and drug candidates
          through the analysis of gene expression patterns and functional
          genomics data.

          In the field of functional genomics, genes work together to carry out
          specific functions in various contexts. In order to understand how
          these genes impact complex traits, it is essential to have a
          comprehensive understanding of their expression regulation across
          different conditions. This knowledge has been shown to be critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, but recent models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease onset and
          progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that links gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we show that using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, functionally important players may lack associations
          but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding gene
          expression patterns and their impact on complex traits in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In recent years, genetic studies and functional genomics have provided
          valuable insights into disease etiology. However, a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is
          necessary to determine how genes influence complex traits. This
          knowledge is critical for developing new therapies. While

          Genes work together to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          making it critical to understand the regulation of expression across
          different conditions for determining how these genes influence complex
          traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
          individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease etiology and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions and expression
          patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanism studies.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions is crucial for identifying the
              genetic factors involved in complex traits. Gene-gene interactions
              have been shown to be critical for disease origin and progression,
              but traditional methods of analyzing gene expression data have
              limitations in identifying these interactions. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines
              transcriptome-wide association studies and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach uses modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions to map gene-trait
              associations, enabling us to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and we use
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation to further validate
              our approach. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which has important
              implications for drug repurposing and the development of new
              therapies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering
              gene interactions in complex trait analysis and provide a valuable
              resource for researchers working in this field.

              Complex traits are the result of interactions between multiple
              genes, and determining how these genes influence these traits
              requires an understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped identify individual genes associated with
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology. To address

              modules and can contextualize these associations to reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can help

              Genes play a complex and interdependent role in the functioning of
              organisms. Understanding how these genes influence disease and
              therapeutic responses requires an understanding of expression
              regulation across different contexts. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify individual genes
              associated with disease, recent models predict that gene-gene

              maps gene expression patterns, pharmacological perturbation data,
              and trait associations into a common latent representation for

              profiles across the same conditions, we observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease

              The study of genes and their interactions in disease development
              is a crucial aspect of modern medical research. However, the
              complexity of these interactions has made it difficult to identify
              specific genes that are responsible for certain diseases. Recent
              advances in functional genomics and transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on this issue by providing new insights
              into gene expression patterns and their associations with disease
              etiology. However, these approaches often rely on single-gene
              analyses, which can miss the broader picture of how groups of
              co-expressed genes interact to contribute to complex traits.


              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering groups of
              co-expressed genes in the context of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. By providing a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER
              can help identify potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This approach has significant implications for future
              therapeutic development and may lead to new insights into the
              underlying causes of complex diseases. Overall, our findings
              highlight the importance of integrating functional genomics and
              gene expression data to better understand disease mechanisms and
              identify new drug targets.

              Genes work in harmony with each other within specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute

              Genetic studies have long been a crucial tool in understanding
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Functional genomics has
              enabled us to analyze gene expression patterns and identify
              potential therapeutic targets. However, the complexity of traits
              and the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
              progression require a more nuanced approach. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. By mapping genes with
              similar expression patterns across different conditions,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, highlighting the importance of grouping genes with
              similar expression patterns in understanding disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms.

              Gene expression patterns are critical in determining how genes
              function together to produce complex traits. However, uncovering
              the underlying mechanisms of disease-relevant mechanisms has been
              a challenge for genetic studies. Modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, but transcriptome-wide association studies have not
              fully captured this complexity. To overcome this challenge, we

              Complex traits, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, are
              influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies.
              Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              identify individual genes associated with disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and
              progression. Therefore, there is a need to develop computational
              approaches that can map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for
              joint analysis.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action.


              In addition to disease associations, we applied PhenoPLIER to
              analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. We found that
              functionally important players lack associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which is crucial for identifying therapeutic targets and
              repurposing drugs in complex diseases. Our approach can be used to
              map genetic associations onto disease etiology and progression
              mechanisms, enabling the discovery of new drug candidates for
              complex diseases.

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              In the complex world of gene regulation, individual genes work in
              concert with each other to perform their functions. However,
              understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
              detailed analysis of expression regulation across various
              conditions. Such insights are critical for developing new
              therapies that can target specific disease mechanisms. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              identifying single gene associations with diseases, the modern
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease development and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that uses gene co-expression modules to map
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
              common latent representation for joint analysis. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              suggests that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which may help
              uncover new therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action in
              complex diseases.

              Complex traits such as diseases are determined by the concerted
              activity of multiple genes, which makes their functional genomics
              a challenging task. Gene co-expression analysis has emerged as a
              promising approach for understanding disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, which poses a significant challenge to the current
              single-gene strategies. To overcome this limitation, we developed
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression
              patterns, pharmacological perturbation data, and gene-trait
              associations into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our analysis revealed that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen,
              we identified functionally important players that lacked
              associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, enabling us to contextualize gene expression patterns and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              findings highlight the importance of functional genomics in
              uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide
              insights into the development of new therapeutic targets.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              The manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This method takes into account the concerted action of

              critical to understand expression regulation across different
              conditions to determine how these genes influence complex traits.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes work together in
              specific contexts to perform their functions, making it crucial to
              understand expression regulation across different conditions to
              determine how genes influence complex traits. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
              individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are critical in disease etiology and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
              associated with relevant cell type-expressed gene modules, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that fills a
              gap in the field of genetics by mapping gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              The manuscript presents a computational approach, PhenoPLIER, that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that bridges the gap between genetic studies and
              functional genomics by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. We address the challenge of
              understanding how genes work together in specific contexts to
              perform their functions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
              functionally important players lacking associations but included
              in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by contextualizing
              genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a
              novel framework for interpreting complex trait etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Our approach has broader significance as it
              facilitates the discovery of therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies and informs drug repurposing efforts.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to create a common latent representation for
              joint analysis. Genes often act synergistically in specific
              contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these
              genes contribute to complex traits requires an understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, which has been
              critical in developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify individual genes
              associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin
              and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules
              of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly

              the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes for
              contextualizing genetic associations and identifying potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a

              Context: Genetic studies have long sought to understand the role
              of specific genes in disease etiology, but modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              progression. Functional genomics has helped uncover these complex
              relationships, but identifying key players and mechanisms is
              challenging. The task of determining how genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions, which can inform new
              therapeutic strategies.


              Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions and can accurately predict known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We applied our
              approach to lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, revealing that
              functionally important players were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules despite lacking associations.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance
              in drug discovery and repurposing. Overall, our findings highlight
              the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease
              etiology and therapeutic target identification.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links
              gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach recognizes
              the importance of gene regulation in specific contexts and
              utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions to map complex traits. By leveraging
              functional genomics techniques, we identify significant disease
              associations with trait-associated gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Additionally, our method accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our
              recent CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates the
              importance of functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, opening up new
              avenues for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics has emerged
              as a powerful tool for understanding complex traits and disease
              mechanisms. Gene co-expression analysis provides valuable insights
              into the molecular pathways involved in various diseases, but
              identifying therapeutic targets based on individual genes can be
              challenging due to the lack of a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. To address this
              gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By utilizing
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, and our approach can help identify new therapeutic
              targets and inform drug repurposing efforts in complex diseases.

              Genetic studies have identified numerous associations with complex
              traits, but the underlying mechanisms of these associations are
              not fully understood. To address this challenge, we developed a
              novel approach that leverages functional genomics to identify gene
              co-expression patterns associated with disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we used a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
              important players lacking associations were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the
              importance of contextualizing genetic associations through gene
              module analysis, which can reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Overall, our study provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying
              therapeutic targets through gene modules.

              The interplay between genes is essential for their functioning.
              However, understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a deeper comprehension of expression regulation across
              distinct conditions. Our research demonstrates that this insight
              is vital in developing new therapies. Our findings reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              we utilize a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have identified numerous
              disease-associated genetic variants, but their functional
              significance is often unclear. To address this gap in the
              literature, our study used gene co-expression patterns to
              contextualize genetic associations and identify potential drug
              targets. We applied a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which
              clustered genes based on their expression profiles across multiple
              cell types and conditions. Our results showed that diseases were
              significantly associated with specific modules of co-expressed
              genes in relevant cell types, and we used this information to
              predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we analyzed lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen
              and found that functionally important players lacked associations
              but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER to
              provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which may lead to new
              therapeutic targets and improved drug repurposing strategies.

              Genes play a crucial role in concerted expression patterns, which
              are essential for their functional regulation. To determine how
              these genes influence complex traits, understanding the mechanisms
              of expression regulation across different contexts is necessary.

              Complex traits are influenced by the interplay of multiple genes,
              but determining how these genes interact in different contexts to
              perform their functions is a challenging task. While this
              knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies, current
              approaches often fail to provide a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. Our study
              addresses this gap by utilizing gene co-expression analysis to
              identify disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. We show that our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action,
              providing valuable insights into the etiology and drug mechanisms
              underlying complex traits.


              To further contextualize genetic associations, we used a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and identified functionally
              important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate

              The study of genes and their interactions has been critical in
              understanding the etiology of complex diseases. However,
              determining how these genes act together to produce disease
              outcomes requires a more comprehensive analysis of gene expression
              patterns across different conditions. In this manuscript, we
              present a novel approach that utilizes functional genomics and
              clustering techniques to identify gene modules associated with
              specific traits and diseases. Our results show that by grouping
              co-expressed genes, our method can accurately predict drug-disease
              pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate
              the utility of this approach through a CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation, where we identified functionally important
              players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study highlights the
              importance of gene co-expression in contextualizing genetic
              associations and revealing potential drug targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of functional genomics,
              which may have broader implications in drug discovery and disease
              treatment.

              In this study, we present a novel approach to understanding the
              interplay of genes in specific contexts and their impact on
              complex traits. We utilized functional genomics data to identify
              gene modules associated with diseases and drug mechanisms,
              providing insights into disease etiology and potential therapeutic
              targets. Our results demonstrate that these gene modules are
              highly accurate predictors of known drug-disease pairs and reveal
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that important
              players lacked associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the
              importance of considering groups of co-expressed genes when
              interpreting genetic associations, as this can contextualize and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with
              applications in drug discovery and disease understanding.

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in the development
              and progression of complex traits, including diseases. However,
              understanding how genes interact with each other to influence
              these traits is a challenging task that requires a comprehensive
              approach. Our study addresses this challenge by applying
              functional genomics techniques to identify gene modules associated
              with specific diseases and cell types. We developed a novel method
              called PhenoPLIER that can accurately predict known drug-disease

              Genes function in a coordinated manner with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. A mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across different conditions is critical
              for determining how these genes influence complex traits and
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have identified the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. The representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which we observe to be significantly associated with
              diseases in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              findings suggest that understanding the genetic architecture of
              complex traits through gene co-expression analysis can help
              identify therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing.

              The study of disease etiology and drug mechanisms requires a
              comprehensive understanding of gene expression patterns. While
              individual genes have been shown to play a role in disease, recent
              models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical for the
              development and progression of complex traits. To address this gap
              in the literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation. This allows
              for a joint analysis of gene expression patterns across different
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER, even if they lacked direct associations. Overall, our
              study highlights the importance of gene co-expression in
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              The present study demonstrates the importance of understanding
              gene expression regulation in complex traits and their role in
              disease etiology. Utilizing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation, we show that diseases
              are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR
              screen analysis on lipid regulation reveals that functionally

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have identified many genes
              associated with disease, but determining the underlying mechanisms

              The coordinated action of genes in specific contexts is essential
              for their functioning. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires an insight into the regulation of

              Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of complex
              traits and disease mechanisms. However, individual gene
              associations with complex traits only provide a partial picture of
              the underlying molecular processes. To bridge this gap, functional
              genomics techniques are increasingly being used to study gene
              expression patterns across different conditions. These studies
              reveal that genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts, making it critical to understand how they influence
              complex traits. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, our approach reveals
              significant disease associations with specific cell types and
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential for drug repurposing and
              therapeutic target discovery. Overall, our work provides a
              powerful tool for identifying new disease biomarkers and drug
              candidates through the analysis of gene expression patterns and
              functional genomics data.

              In the field of functional genomics, genes work together to carry
              out specific functions in various contexts. In order to understand
              how these genes impact complex traits, it is essential to have a
              comprehensive understanding of their expression regulation across
              different conditions. This knowledge has been shown to be critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped identify individual genes involved in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, but recent models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease onset and progression. In this manuscript, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, we show that
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, functionally
              important players may lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, this study
              highlights the importance of understanding gene expression
              patterns and their impact on complex traits in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms.

              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene

              The study of genes and their interactions in specific contexts is
              crucial for understanding complex traits and developing new
              therapies. However, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our approach uses modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions
              to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use PhenoPLIER to analyze
              lipid regulation in a CRISPR screen and find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. Overall, our study highlights the
              importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
