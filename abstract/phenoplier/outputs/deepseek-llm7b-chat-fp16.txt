          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The study of complex traits relies on a mechanistic understanding of
          gene expression regulation across various conditions. Although
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, they fail to account for gene
          interactions and their impact on complex diseases (e.g., drug
          repurposing). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          suitable for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of co-expressed
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our
          study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we accurately
          predict known drug-disease pairs using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation. Our findings highlight that PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides
          insights into the functional significance of co-expressed genes,
          contributing to the broader field of gene expression analysis in
          complex diseases (e.g., drug repurposing).

          Genes collaborate in concert to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic examination of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated that this insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies (TWAS) have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map
          gene-trait associations into common latent representations for joint
          analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, revealing significant association with diseases
          involving specific cell types. Our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, prioritizing
          functionally important players within trait-associated gene modules
          through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation.


          In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes using
          PhenoPLIER, genetic associations can be contextualized and potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies can be revealed. This novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations provides valuable
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, offering a
          promising avenue for therapeutic repurposing.

          The study of complex traits such as diseases requires a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,

          across the same conditions to identify potential therapeutic targets,
          our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

          analyzing lipid regulation via a CRISPR screen, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          incorporating gene co-expression patterns enables contextualizing

          Genes work together in complex biological processes to carry out their
          functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation is crucial for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have

          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This method uses modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to
          establish significant connections between diseases and cell types, as
          well as accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, analyzing lipid regulation using
          CRISPR screens identified functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated gene modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In summary, through the integration of groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations to reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering new
          therapeutic targets, this approach represents an innovative
          advancement in functional genomics research.

          In the study of complex traits, genes interact and perform functions
          in concert with each other across specific contexts. A mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation is crucial for developing
          new therapies, yet our knowledge of gene-gene interactions in disease
          origin remains limited. Recent models predict a significant role for
          such interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this
          gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. 


          PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant
          associations between diseases and these modules. Our results
          demonstrate accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and
          uncover mechanisms of action by inferring interactions among
          disease-associated gene modules. Furthermore, analyzing lipid
          regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. 


          In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of PhenoPLIER as a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules. By contextualizing these associations, PhenoPLIER can
          reveal untapped therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies
          and contribute to advancing drug repurposing efforts in complex
          diseases.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          which makes it crucial for understanding complex traits. To achieve
          this, a mechanistic approach that considers gene expression regulation
          across different conditions is necessary. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped identify the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and
          progression.


          PhenoPLIER offers a novel computational method to map gene
          associations with drug perturbation data into common latent
          representations for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules
          of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, allowing it to
          identify diseases significantly associated with specific cell types.
          Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action.


          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating
          groups of co-expressed genes using PhenoPLIER can provide a contextual
          understanding of genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through gene modules offers valuable
          insights into disease etiology and therapeutic targets.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene expression
          patterns is crucial for elucidating complex traits and their
          underlying mechanisms. However, current approaches are limited in
          capturing the full extent of interactions between genes due to a lack
          of comprehensive analysis methods. This study aims to address this gap
          by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis.


          PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes across the same
          conditions to identify disease-associated gene networks and potential
          therapeutic targets. The method accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action in various diseases.
          Furthermore, it identifies functionally important players that are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when
          lacking associations themselves.


          By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          contextualizing them within the context of gene modules. This approach
          expands our understanding of complex diseases and opens up new
          opportunities for drug repurposing by highlighting previously
          unexplored therapeutic targets.

          Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of complex traits, but
          the interplay between genes and their regulation remains elusive.
          PhenoPLIER addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This approach identifies modules of co-expressed
          genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, highlighting
          potential targets for drug repurposing. Our findings demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with these modules, and our
          predictions accurately identify known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, by
          using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we uncover
          functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER but lacking associations. In conclusion, the
          contextualization of genetic associations through gene modules can
          reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies
          and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic studies.

          PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method, provides an
          innovative approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This methodology allows us to explore the collaborative role
          of genes in performing their functions. We emphasize that
          understanding expression regulation across different conditions is
          crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have contributed significantly to elucidating individual gene
          roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a vital part in complex trait origin and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation revolves around modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. 


          Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and
          specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, confirming the
          accuracy of our approach in predicting well-known drug-disease pairs
          and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by conducting a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial
          players that lack associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER's framework. In conclusion,
          integrating gene co-expression patterns enables PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked in single-gene strategies. This novel method offers
          a valuable perspective on interpreting genetic data through the lens
          of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In recent years,
          functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding of complex
          traits by elucidating the intricate relationships between genes and
          their functions in concert with each other. However, a mechanistic
          understanding of these interactions is critical for developing new
          therapies, given that transcriptome-wide association studies have
          uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms but
          fail to account for gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER—a computational approach
          mapping gene-trait associations into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. Our method
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, revealing significant association between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types while
          accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. In addition, using CRISPR screens to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules, demonstrating its potential for uncovering novel therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, this work provides
          a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          lens of gene co-expression patterns and highlights disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach that
          unravels the complex interplay between genetic associations and gene
          expression patterns for a comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology. By integrating pharmacological perturbation data with
          gene-trait associations, we establish a common latent representation
          to explore functional genomics across different contexts. Our study
          emphasizes how genes collaborate in concert to perform their
          functions, emphasizing the importance of elucidating these intricate
          relationships to advance therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have indeed shed light on individual gene roles in
          disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that genetic
          interactions are essential for complex trait origins and progression.


          PhenoPLIER's methodology is predicated upon identifying modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant
          conditions, thereby emphasizing the importance of understanding
          coordinated gene regulation. Our findings reveal substantial
          associations between diseases and specific cell types characterized by
          co-expressed gene clusters. Remarkably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs, as well as inferring mechanisms underlying
          therapeutic effects. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility in
          identifying novel regulatory targets through a CRISPR screen on lipid
          regulation. Our results underscore the value of integrating multiple
          genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER serves as an innovative framework for
          interpreting complex genetic relationships via gene modules, thereby
          enabling a deeper understanding of disease etiology, drug mechanisms,
          and identifying novel therapeutic opportunities.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation, fills an important gap in the literature by
          leveraging gene co-expression patterns to reveal disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. Here we describe how PhenoPLIER uses modules of genes
          with similar expression across relevant cell types to contextualize
          genetic associations and discover potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, our approach can provide a novel framework for interpreting
          complex traits and their underlying gene regulation. 


          Using transcriptome-wide association studies and a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and identifies functionally important players
          prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding
          complex traits and suggest that our approach can guide drug
          repurposing efforts by revealing mechanisms of action for currently
          used medications. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for
          functional genomics research and has significant implications for
          therapeutic target discovery and disease etiology analysis.

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach, has been developed
          to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The
          collaborative function of genes in specific contexts is essential for
          understanding complex traits and developing new therapies. Recent
          transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest
          that gene interactions play an indispensable part in determining
          disease origin and progression.


          PhenoPLIER's innovative approach relies on modules of co-expressed
          genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions,
          demonstrating significant associations between diseases and these cell
          type-specific modules. Our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action based on
          transcriptomic data. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identified functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, the integration of groups of co-expressed genes into
          our computational framework contextualizes genetic associations and
          unveils potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying complex
          traits through gene module analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          approach to drug repurposing and disease etiology interpretation.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In this study, we address a critical gap in the literature by
          developing and implementing PhenoPLIER - an innovative computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. By exploring gene co-expression patterns across different
          conditions, our method uncovers mechanistic insights essential for
          devising novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          provided valuable information on the role of individual genes in
          disease processes; however, modern models suggest that complex traits
          are significantly influenced by gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's
          unique approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes and their
          relevance to specific conditions, allowing us to identify significant
          associations between diseases and these gene modules while accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
          action.


          Using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. This
          finding highlights the potential of our approach to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal therapeutic targets missed through
          single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations within the context of
          gene co-expression patterns and functional networks. By doing so, this
          study significantly advances our understanding of disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms while paving the way for potential therapeutic
          interventions in complex disorders.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach that
          unlocks the complex interplay between genetic associations and disease
          etiology by translating gene expression patterns into a unified latent
          representation. Understanding how genes collaborate to modulate
          intricate traits requires a comprehensive evaluation of their
          regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions. While single-gene
          studies have shed light on individual roles in disease processes,
          modern models predict that gene interactions play an essential role in
          complex trait origins and progression.


          PhenoPLIER constructs modules consisting of genes exhibiting
          comparable expression patterns under identical conditions, revealing
          the profound connection between diseases and specific cell types. Our
          approach adeptly identifies known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          therapeutic mechanisms by predicting disease etiology with remarkable
          accuracy. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we demonstrate that functionally significant players are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack
          associations themselves.


          In summary, utilizing gene co-expression patterns enables PhenoPLIER
          to contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. This
          innovative framework paves the way for a deeper comprehension of
          complex traits through the lens of gene modules.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach presented in this study,
          offers an innovative solution to bridge the gap between genetic
          studies and drug repurposing. It integrates gene-trait associations
          with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Our findings demonstrate that
          understanding complex traits' expression regulation across different
          conditions is crucial for developing new therapies by highlighting how
          genes interact together in concerted efforts. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          determining the origin and progression of complex traits.


          We present that diseases are significantly associated with specific
          modules of co-expressed genes expressed across relevant cell types
          using transcriptomic data from various conditions. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Furthermore, we validate our
          findings through a CRISPR screen in lipid regulation, revealing
          functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated modules
          using PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the novel framework provided by
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          drug repurposing opportunities by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes. This study establishes a significant contribution to functional
          genomics research, providing new insights into disease etiology and
          therapeutic mechanisms while moving the broader field forward.

          Gene expression is a complex interplay of genes working together, and
          understanding their roles in determining complex traits demands
          elucidating the mechanisms governing gene regulation across various
          conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies, as
          our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to
          specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and revealing underlying
          mechanisms of action. By employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we found that functionally important genes lack

          highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed in single-gene

          individual genes, but recent functional genomics research demonstrates
          that gene expression patterns in different contexts contribute
          significantly to these traits. In this context, our research aims to
          project genetic associations through co-expressed genes, highlighting
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We developed PhenoPLIER—an
          approach that clusters complex trait-associated gene modules—to
          address the gap of missing mechanistic understanding in genetic
          studies.


          Using functional genomics datasets, we demonstrate accurate
          predictions of known drug-disease pairs and infer new therapeutic
          targets via our method. Furthermore, analyzing a CRISPR screen on
          lipid regulation using PhenoPLIER, we find that key players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules,
          providing novel insights into the mechanism of action for these drugs.


          In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes through
          PhenoPLIER, our research highlights missed targets from single-gene
          strategies and advances drug repurposing efforts through a better
          understanding of complex disease etiology. This study thus provides a
          new framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of
          gene modules, highlighting how this approach could significantly
          impact the field by bridging functional genomics with therapeutic
          target discovery.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the study of complex traits, genes collaborate in specific contexts
          to perform their functions. To understand how these genes contribute
          to disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding
          of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial
          for developing novel therapies (context). Our research presents an
          innovative approach called PhenoPLIER that utilizes co-expression
          patterns to contextualize genetic associations by identifying groups
          of functionally related genes (content). We demonstrate its accuracy
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of
          action, using both CRISPR screening and a lipid regulation model
          (results). Moreover, we reveal that functional players in
          trait-associated modules lack associations but are prioritized within
          these gene networks. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations by incorporating
          co-expressed genes, highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies and advancing the field of drug repurposing
          (broader significance).

          This study fills a gap in the literature by projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. The context of functional genomics and
          clustering complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions for developing new
          therapies. Our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by contextualizing
          genetic associations with gene modules. Furthermore, we demonstrate
          the utility of our method using CRISPR screens to prioritize
          functionally important players in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through co-expressed gene groups, potentially revealing
          novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Gene co-expression plays a crucial role in complex trait regulation,
          wherein multiple genes work together to perform their functions. To
          gain insights into the genetic basis of diseases and develop effective
          therapies, it is essential to understand gene expression patterns
          across different cellular contexts. Our research highlights that
          significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules
          are projected through these co-expression patterns. Moreover, our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          underlying mechanisms for therapeutic interventions.


          Utilizing a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we discovered
          that functionally crucial players in this process lack associations
          with disease traits but still hold importance within the context of
          trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER. This novel framework
          contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes and uncovers potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene approaches. In conclusion, our findings emphasize that
          PhenoPLIER can be a valuable tool for drug repurposing efforts by
          revealing the complex interplay between genetic associations and gene
          expression patterns in various diseases.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          gene expression patterns is crucial for elucidating complex trait
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, identifying key genes involved
          in various diseases has been challenging due to the lack of a
          comprehensive approach that can accurately predict known drug-disease
          pairs and infer their therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we
          developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that integrates gene
          co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. 


          In this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to analyze various disease
          datasets, successfully predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen
          focusing on lipid regulation, we identified functionally important
          players in trait-associated modules that lack associations but are
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential for
          PhenoPLIER to revolutionize drug repurposing efforts by providing
          novel therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of complex
          diseases.


          In conclusion, by utilizing gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER
          offers a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          advancing personalized medicine.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic examination of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Our study highlights the critical importance of this
          insight for developing new therapies by demonstrating significant
          genetic associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, as well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players
          that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. This approach contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing
          a novel framework for interpreting genetic studies through the lens of
          gene co-expression patterns.

          Genetic studies aim to understand the underlying mechanisms of complex
          traits and diseases by investigating gene-gene interactions. However,
          functional genomic approaches are limited in predicting drug targets
          for specific conditions due to their inability to capture gene
          co-expression patterns across diverse cell types. This gap is crucial
          as understanding these associations could lead to more precise
          therapies, enhancing treatment outcomes. 


          To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel method
          that utilizes gene module expressions in relevant cell populations. By
          applying the technique to known drug-disease pairs and analyzing lipid
          regulation using CRISPR screening, our results highlight accurate
          predictions of disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms. Moreover,
          functionally important players are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules despite lacking associations, providing new insights into
          genetic studies' limitations.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene module co-expression patterns. This
          approach fills the gap in functional genomic research by
          contextualizing complex disease traits and unveiling potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, contributing to
          drug repurposing efforts and advancing our understanding of genetic
          association mechanisms.

          Genes work together in harmony to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a deep
          dive into the expression regulation across various conditions. This
          knowledge is crucial for developing innovative therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene roles in disease mechanisms, it has been suggested that gene-gene
          interactions play a vital role in the origin and progression of
          diseases.


          To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER – an innovative
          computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This method leverages modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across different conditions, revealing
          strong associations between diseases and these gene modules. Moreover,
          our model successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects.


          In support of PhenoPLIER's utility, we employ a CRISPR screen to
          investigate lipid regulation in relevant cell types. Our results
          demonstrate that functionally important players lacking associations
          are prioritized by trait-associated modules, further validating our
          approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          Genes collaborate in complex biological processes to perform their
          functions. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex traits, a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions is crucial. This insight has been shown to be
          vital for developing new therapeutic strategies. Although
          transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes involved in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in determining the
          origins and progression of diseases.


          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational
          approach aimed at mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. The methodology is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that disease severity is significantly associated with
          specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR
          screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing functionally
          important players that lack associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by the proposed approach.


          In conclusion, our study not only expands upon the existing literature
          on functional genomics and gene co-expression for drug repurposing but
          also highlights novel therapeutic targets through a more precise
          understanding of disease etiology.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes interact with each other to perform their functions,
          contributing to complex traits. To gain a mechanistic understanding of
          gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential
          for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have identified the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms;
          however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a vital
          role in disease etiology and progression.


          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach introduced here, maps gene-trait

          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions, revealing insights into diseases' association with
          specific cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          Utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized

          strategies through a better understanding of complex traits'

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together to perform their functions, and understanding how
          they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach

          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, our method highlights diseases significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types while accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules.


          In conclusion, our study fills the gap in understanding gene
          interactions and their role in complex traits, drug repurposing, and
          disease mechanisms by introducing PhenoPLIER - a novel computational
          approach with significant potential for advancing therapeutic
          strategies and drug development.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions, and understanding how
          they contribute to complex traits demands a mechanistic evaluation of
          expression regulation across diverse contexts. This insight is vital
          for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms;
          however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal

          of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same

          diseases and trait-associated gene modules while accurately predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.
          Utilizing CRISPR screening techniques for lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct
          associations with these traits.

          Our study addresses the critical need for a mechanistic understanding
          of gene expression regulation in complex traits, as it is essential
          for developing novel therapies. Despite advancements,
          transcriptome-wide association studies have limitations in capturing
          gene-gene interactions and disease etiology due to their focus on
          individual genes. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a significant role in complex trait origins and progression.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational method mapping gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          approach highlights disease-associated gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs,
          providing insights into mechanisms of action.


          Additionally, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation. These findings
          significantly expand our understanding of complex traits, disease
          etiology, and therapeutic targets, highlighting the potential for drug
          repurposing to treat a wide range of conditions.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes collaborate with each other to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a
          comprehensive analysis of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This mechanistic insight is essential for developing novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease
          etiology and progression.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions, allowing us to analyze complex traits with
          significant association to disease mechanisms in various cell types.


          PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating drug action mechanisms was validated using a CRISPR screen
          analyzing lipid regulation. Our results demonstrate that functionally
          important players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, indicating its potential for identifying novel therapeutic
          targets and repurposing existing drugs for treating complex diseases.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

          Complex traits are shaped by the coordinated expression of multiple
          genes, and understanding these interactions is crucial for developing
          new therapies. However, current methods mainly focus on individual
          gene associations and overlook the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules
          of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types,
          our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules. Moreover, it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          identifies mechanisms of action in various biological processes. To
          further validate PhenoPLIER's significance, we conducted a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by the proposed method. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only contributes to our understanding of complex traits
          but also offers promising avenues for drug repurposing and therapeutic
          target discovery.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, requiring a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation for complex trait determination.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We
              observe significant association with disease relevant cell types
              and accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs along with
              inferring mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen revealed
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables
              contextualizing genetic associations, revealing potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies and providing a novel framework

              The study of complex traits relies on a mechanistic understanding
              of gene expression regulation across various conditions. Although
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms, they fail to account for
              gene interactions and their impact on complex diseases (e.g., drug
              repurposing). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation suitable for joint analysis. By leveraging modules
              of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions, our study reveals significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Furthermore, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our findings
              highlight that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
              and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This novel framework provides insights into the functional
              significance of co-expressed genes, contributing to the broader
              field of gene expression analysis in complex diseases (e.g., drug
              repurposing).

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate in concert to perform their functions, and
              understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic examination of expression regulation across different
              conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated that this insight is
              critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies (TWAS) have helped uncover the role of

              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map
              gene-trait associations into common latent representations for
              joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing

              players within trait-associated gene modules through a CRISPR

              In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes using

              Genes work together in complex biological processes to carry out
              their functions. To understand how these genes influence complex
              traits, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
              is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify the role of individual

              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait

              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

              and cell types, as well as accurately predicting known

              analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens identified
              functionally important players lacking associations but

              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations to reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and

              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic

              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are

              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              In the study of complex traits, genes interact and perform
              functions in concert with each other across specific contexts. A
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation is crucial
              for developing new therapies, yet our knowledge of gene-gene
              interactions in disease origin remains limited. Recent models
              predict a significant role for such interactions in disease
              etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. 


              PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant
              associations between diseases and these modules. Our results
              demonstrate accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and
              uncover mechanisms of action by inferring interactions among
              disease-associated gene modules. Furthermore, analyzing lipid
              regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. 


              In conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of PhenoPLIER
              as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing these associations,
              PhenoPLIER can reveal untapped therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies and contribute to advancing drug
              repurposing efforts in complex diseases.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              which makes it crucial for understanding complex traits. To
              achieve this, a mechanistic approach that considers gene
              expression regulation across different conditions is necessary.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the
              role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role
              in disease etiology and progression.


              PhenoPLIER offers a novel computational method to map gene
              associations with drug perturbation data into common latent
              representations for joint analysis. This approach is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, allowing
              it to identify diseases significantly associated with specific
              cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through gene modules offers valuable insights into
              disease etiology and therapeutic targets.

              In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene expression
              patterns is crucial for elucidating complex traits and their
              underlying mechanisms. However, current approaches are limited in
              capturing the full extent of interactions between genes due to a
              lack of comprehensive analysis methods. This study aims to address
              this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.


              PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes across the same
              conditions to identify disease-associated gene networks and
              potential therapeutic targets. The method accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action in
              various diseases. Furthermore, it identifies functionally
              important players that are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER, even when lacking associations themselves.


              By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides
              a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
              contextualizing them within the context of gene modules. This

              previously unexplored therapeutic targets.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, leading to complex traits. A mechanistic understanding
              of gene expression regulation across different conditions is
              crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
              disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression.


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, utilizing modules of
              co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across
              relevant conditions. This method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by
              contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules.


              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through the
              lens of gene modules can reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies and contextualize genetic associations for
              a better understanding of complex diseases.

              Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of complex traits,
              but the interplay between genes and their regulation remains
              elusive. PhenoPLIER addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This approach identifies
              modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns
              across conditions, highlighting potential targets for drug
              repurposing. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with these modules, and our predictions
              accurately identify known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, by using
              CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we uncover
              functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER but lacking associations. In conclusion, the
              contextualization of genetic associations through gene modules can
              reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              studies.

              PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method, provides an
              innovative approach to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This methodology allows us to
              explore the collaborative role of genes in performing their
              functions. We emphasize that understanding expression regulation
              across different conditions is crucial for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to elucidating individual gene roles in disease
              mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a vital part in complex trait origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation revolves around modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. 


              Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and
              specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, confirming
              the accuracy of our approach in predicting well-known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by
              conducting a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              identify functionally crucial players that lack associations but
              are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER's
              framework. In conclusion, integrating gene co-expression patterns
              enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential therapeutic targets overlooked in single-gene
              strategies. This novel method offers a valuable perspective on
              interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene modules.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In recent years,
              functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding of

              disease-relevant mechanisms but fail to account for gene-gene

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach
              that unravels the complex interplay between genetic associations
              and gene expression patterns for a comprehensive understanding of
              disease etiology. By integrating pharmacological perturbation data
              with gene-trait associations, we establish a common latent
              representation to explore functional genomics across different
              contexts. Our study emphasizes how genes collaborate in concert to
              perform their functions, emphasizing the importance of elucidating
              these intricate relationships to advance therapeutic development.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have indeed shed light on
              individual gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              models predict that genetic interactions are essential for complex
              trait origins and progression.


              PhenoPLIER's methodology is predicated upon identifying modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant
              conditions, thereby emphasizing the importance of understanding
              coordinated gene regulation. Our findings reveal substantial
              associations between diseases and specific cell types
              characterized by co-expressed gene clusters. Remarkably,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, as well
              as inferring mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects. Moreover,
              we demonstrate its utility in identifying novel regulatory targets
              through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation. Our results
              underscore the value of integrating multiple genes to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER serves as an innovative framework for
              interpreting complex genetic relationships via gene modules,
              thereby enabling a deeper understanding of disease etiology, drug
              mechanisms, and identifying novel therapeutic opportunities.

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach we introduce, maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. To determine how complex
              traits are influenced by these genes acting in concert with each
              other, we require a mechanistic understanding of their expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies since transcriptome-wide association

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function
              in concert with each other across diverse contexts to perform
              their functions, highlighting the importance of understanding
              expression regulation in complex traits. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene
              interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of
              complex diseases. PhenoPLIER employs modules of co-expressed genes
              with similar expression patterns across conditions to project
              genetic associations into a molecular context. We demonstrate
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed within relevant cell types using known drug-disease
              pairs, providing insights into therapeutic mechanisms.
              Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis reveals that functionally
              important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER, despite lacking direct associations. In conclusion,
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables a more
              comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations and uncovers

              Using transcriptome-wide association studies and a CRISPR screen
              for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies functionally
              important players prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
              results highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions in understanding complex traits and suggest that our
              approach can guide drug repurposing efforts by revealing
              mechanisms of action for currently used medications. Overall,
              PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for functional genomics
              research and has significant implications for therapeutic target
              discovery and disease etiology analysis.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach, has been
              developed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. The collaborative function of genes in specific contexts
              is essential for understanding complex traits and developing new
              therapies. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have
              revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms;
              however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play an
              indispensable part in determining disease origin and progression.


              PhenoPLIER's innovative approach relies on modules of co-expressed
              genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions,
              demonstrating significant associations between diseases and these
              cell type-specific modules. Our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action based on
              transcriptomic data. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players
              that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              gene modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, the integration of groups of co-expressed genes
              into our computational framework contextualizes genetic
              associations and unveils potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. By uncovering the molecular mechanisms
              underlying complex traits through gene module analysis, PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel approach to drug repurposing and disease etiology
              interpretation.

              In this study, we address a critical gap in the literature by
              developing and implementing PhenoPLIER - an innovative
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By exploring gene co-expression
              patterns across different conditions, our method uncovers
              mechanistic insights essential for devising novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
              information on the role of individual genes in disease processes;
              however, modern models suggest that complex traits are
              significantly influenced by gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's
              unique approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes and
              their relevance to specific conditions, allowing us to identify
              significant associations between diseases and these gene modules
              while accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidating mechanisms of action.


              Using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. This
              finding highlights the potential of our approach to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal therapeutic targets missed through
              single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations within the context
              of gene co-expression patterns and functional networks. By doing
              so, this study significantly advances our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms while paving the way for potential
              therapeutic interventions in complex disorders.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach that
              unlocks the complex interplay between genetic associations and
              disease etiology by translating gene expression patterns into a
              unified latent representation. Understanding how genes collaborate
              to modulate intricate traits requires a comprehensive evaluation
              of their regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions. While
              single-gene studies have shed light on individual roles in disease
              processes, modern models predict that gene interactions play an
              essential role in complex trait origins and progression.


              PhenoPLIER constructs modules consisting of genes exhibiting
              comparable expression patterns under identical conditions,
              revealing the profound connection between diseases and specific
              cell types. Our approach adeptly identifies known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidates therapeutic mechanisms by predicting disease
              etiology with remarkable accuracy. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR
              screen to investigate lipid regulation, we demonstrate that
              functionally significant players are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack associations
              themselves.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene

              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach presented in this
              study, offers an innovative solution to bridge the gap between
              genetic studies and drug repurposing. It integrates gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our findings demonstrate
              that understanding complex traits' expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies by
              highlighting how genes interact together in concerted efforts.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in determining the origin and
              progression of complex traits.


              We present that diseases are significantly associated with
              specific modules of co-expressed genes expressed across relevant
              cell types using transcriptomic data from various conditions. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action, providing valuable insights into potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Furthermore,
              we validate our findings through a CRISPR screen in lipid
              regulation, revealing functionally important players prioritized
              in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the
              novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential drug repurposing opportunities
              by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. This study
              establishes a significant contribution to functional genomics
              research, providing new insights into disease etiology and
              therapeutic mechanisms while moving the broader field forward.

              Gene expression is a complex interplay of genes working together,
              and understanding their roles in determining complex traits
              demands elucidating the mechanisms governing gene regulation
              across various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing
              novel therapies, as our study demonstrates that diseases are
              significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and revealing underlying mechanisms of action. By employing
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important genes lack associations but remain
              prioritized within trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER.
              This novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, highlighting potential
              therapeutic targets missed in single-gene approaches. Overall, our
              findings suggest that integrating gene module analyses can enhance
              the interpretation and application of genetic studies for drug
              repurposing efforts.

              The study of complex traits and diseases has traditionally focused
              on individual genes, but recent functional genomics research
              demonstrates that gene expression patterns in different contexts
              contribute significantly to these traits. In this context, our
              research aims to project genetic associations through co-expressed
              genes, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We
              developed PhenoPLIER—an approach that clusters complex
              trait-associated gene modules—to address the gap of missing
              mechanistic understanding in genetic studies.


              Using functional genomics datasets, we demonstrate accurate
              predictions of known drug-disease pairs and infer new therapeutic
              targets via our method. Furthermore, analyzing a CRISPR screen on
              lipid regulation using PhenoPLIER, we find that key players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules,
              providing novel insights into the mechanism of action for these
              drugs.


              In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes through
              PhenoPLIER, our research highlights missed targets from
              single-gene strategies and advances drug repurposing efforts
              through a better understanding of complex disease etiology. This
              study thus provides a new framework for interpreting genetic

              approach could significantly impact the field by bridging

              Genes operate in concert to perform their functions, and
              understanding gene expression regulation is essential for
              deciphering complex traits. This insight is crucial for the
              development of novel therapies. In this study, we reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. Thus,
              integrating groups of co-expressed genes using PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings establish
              PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling the
              discovery of therapeutic targets for complex diseases.

              In the study of complex traits, genes collaborate in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. To understand how these genes
              contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation across different
              conditions is crucial for developing novel therapies (context).
              Our research presents an innovative approach called PhenoPLIER
              that utilizes co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic
              associations by identifying groups of functionally related genes
              (content). We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action, using both
              CRISPR screening and a lipid regulation model (results). Moreover,
              we reveal that functional players in trait-associated modules lack
              associations but are prioritized within these gene networks. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed genes,
              highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies and advancing the field of drug repurposing (broader

              Gene co-expression plays a crucial role in complex trait
              regulation, wherein multiple genes work together to perform their
              functions. To gain insights into the genetic basis of diseases and
              develop effective therapies, it is essential to understand gene
              expression patterns across different cellular contexts. Our
              research highlights that significant associations between diseases
              and specific gene modules are projected through these
              co-expression patterns. Moreover, our method accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and elucidates underlying mechanisms for
              therapeutic interventions.


              Utilizing a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally crucial players in this process lack
              associations with disease traits but still hold importance within
              the context of trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER.
              This novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes and uncovers potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches. In
              conclusion, our findings emphasize that PhenoPLIER can be a
              valuable tool for drug repurposing efforts by revealing the
              complex interplay between genetic associations and gene expression

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for elucidating
              complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms. However, identifying
              key genes involved in various diseases has been challenging due to
              the lack of a comprehensive approach that can accurately predict
              known drug-disease pairs and infer their therapeutic targets. To
              address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative method
              that integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. 


              In this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to analyze various disease
              datasets, successfully predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen
              focusing on lipid regulation, we identified functionally important
              players in trait-associated modules that lack associations but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential
              for PhenoPLIER to revolutionize drug repurposing efforts by
              providing novel therapeutic targets and enhancing our
              understanding of complex diseases.


              In conclusion, by utilizing gene co-expression patterns,
              PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for interpreting genetic
              associations and advancing personalized medicine.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions,
              and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic examination of expression regulation across
              different conditions. Our study highlights the critical importance
              of this insight for developing new therapies by demonstrating

              relevant cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known

              Genetic studies aim to understand the underlying mechanisms of
              complex traits and diseases by investigating gene-gene
              interactions. However, functional genomic approaches are limited
              in predicting drug targets for specific conditions due to their
              inability to capture gene co-expression patterns across diverse
              cell types. This gap is crucial as understanding these
              associations could lead to more precise therapies, enhancing
              treatment outcomes. 


              To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel method
              that utilizes gene module expressions in relevant cell
              populations. By applying the technique to known drug-disease pairs
              and analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, our results
              highlight accurate predictions of disease etiology and therapeutic
              mechanisms. Moreover, functionally important players are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules despite lacking
              associations, providing new insights into genetic studies'
              limitations.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through gene module
              co-expression patterns. This approach fills the gap in functional
              genomic research by contextualizing complex disease traits and
              unveiling potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, contributing to drug repurposing efforts and advancing
              our understanding of genetic association mechanisms.

              Genes work together in harmony to perform their functions, and
              understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
              deep dive into the expression regulation across various
              conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing innovative
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, it has been
              suggested that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the
              origin and progression of diseases.


              To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER – an innovative
              computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This method leverages modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across different
              conditions, revealing strong associations between diseases and
              these gene modules. Moreover, our model successfully predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms underlying
              their therapeutic effects.


              In support of PhenoPLIER's utility, we employ a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation in relevant cell types. Our results
              demonstrate that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized by trait-associated modules, further
              validating our approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing opportunities.

              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes collaborate in complex biological processes to perform their
              functions. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex traits,
              a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial. This insight has been shown to be
              vital for developing new therapeutic strategies. Although
              transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
              genes involved in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a significant role in determining the
              origins and progression of diseases.


              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational
              approach aimed at mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. The methodology is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that disease severity is
              significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              by the proposed approach.


              In conclusion, our study not only expands upon the existing
              literature on functional genomics and gene co-expression for drug
              repurposing but also highlights novel therapeutic targets through
              a more precise understanding of disease etiology.

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for

              etiology and progression.


              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach introduced here, maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing insights
              into diseases' association with specific cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action.


              Utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression patterns
              in disease etiology and therapeutic targets, demonstrating the
              potential for drug repurposing strategies through a better
              understanding of complex traits' underlying mechanisms.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions, and understanding
              how they contribute to complex traits demands a mechanistic
              evaluation of expression regulation across diverse contexts. This
              insight is vital for developing novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in both disease

              Genes collaborate with each other to perform their functions, and
              understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits
              requires a comprehensive analysis of gene expression regulation
              across different conditions. This mechanistic insight is essential
              for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have identified the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and
              progression.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
              analyze complex traits with significant association to disease
              mechanisms in various cell types.


              PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidating drug action mechanisms was validated using a CRISPR
              screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our results demonstrate that
              functionally important players are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, indicating its potential
              for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing
              drugs for treating complex diseases.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe

              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Complex traits are shaped by the coordinated expression of
              multiple genes, and understanding these interactions is crucial
              for developing new therapies. However, current methods mainly
              focus on individual gene associations and overlook the importance
              of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across relevant cell types, our method reveals
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules.
              Moreover, it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              identifies mechanisms of action in various biological processes.
              To further validate PhenoPLIER's significance, we conducted a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by the proposed method. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only contributes to our understanding
              of complex traits but also offers promising avenues for drug
              repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
