Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

"[PASS] (1.00) The intricate interplay of genes in specific contexts is crucial for their proper functioning. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the etiology and progression of diseases.

Our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. In addition, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.
