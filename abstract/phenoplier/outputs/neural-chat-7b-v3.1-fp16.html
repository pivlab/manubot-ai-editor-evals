A comprehensive understanding of the influences these genes have on various traits requires insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is crucial for developing effective therapies. Existing approaches based on transcriptome-wide association studies shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a key role in complex trait manifestation and development. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes not associated with traits are prioritized by PhenoPLIER when included within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups offers a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, which may lead to the identification of overlooked potential targets beyond single-gene approaches.">[PASS] (1.00)  Genes operate in complex interactions within specific contexts to perform their functions.

 Genes collaborate within specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a thorough comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial in the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations as well as inferring their mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we observe that functionally significant players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.
