Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enhances PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00)  Genes work in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

By understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, the impact of these gene interactions on complex traits can be elucidated. This knowledge is crucial for advancing therapeutic development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have highlighted the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the origin and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions; we observe that diseases are significantly associated with these relevant cell types' gene modules. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, uncovers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes essential players in trait-associated modules via a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. PhenoPLIER thus contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets that might be missed using single-gene approaches. In this way, our framework offers a novel perspective on interpreting genetic associations through gene expression modules' lenses.</td>

 In the current study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This method can be applied to complex traits by understanding how genes with similar expression patterns influence diseases across different conditions, which is crucial in developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene roles, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, drug mechanisms, and prioritizes essential players within trait-associated modules that lack traditional associations. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into gene-trait analyses, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations, reveal overlooked targets, and provide a framework for interpreting these complex relationships.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

 Genes collaborate intricately to execute their functions, with concerted efforts required for influencing complex traits. To gain a thorough understanding of this regulatory process is essential for developing new therapeutic solutions. In our study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressing in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease connections as well as elucidates the mechanisms of action involved. We used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, discovering essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. By incorporating gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic relationships, revealing potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework presented by PhenoPLIER enables novel interpretations of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing a comprehensive approach for disease understanding and therapeutic advancements.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

 Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates an insight into the mechanisms of expression regulation across various conditions.
