          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
          perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
          base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.
      response:
        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating an understanding of how these genes influence complex traits. Identifying the mechanisms underlying this impact is crucial for developing novel therapies and comprehending drug repurposing. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in revealing individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes, modern models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in contributing to disease etiology. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses a latent representation derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions for joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. By leveraging these gene clusters, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with relevant cell types'' gene expressions, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, it was discovered that functionally crucial players were not originally linked but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER due to their co-expression. Conclusively, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enhances the interpretation of genetic associations through gene modules, offering a new framework for better understanding and targeting disease mechanisms beyond single-gene approaches.'

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

        output: ' Genes work in collaboration with one another to carry out their functions, particularly within specific contexts. To gain a better understanding of how these genes influence complex traits, we must uncover the underlying mechanisms governing their expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of complex diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data using a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, this approach can identify diseases associated with relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs. By inferring mechanisms of action, it prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules that might otherwise be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we observed that PhenoPLIER helps contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by traditional approaches. Through this novel framework, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative approach for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed

          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

        output: ' The interplay of genes influences their functions and contributes to the development of complex traits. Unraveling the mechanisms behind gene expression regulation is essential for understanding disease etiology and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in disease-related mechanisms, modern models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in determining the architecture of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with relevant gene modules expressed in specific cell types and demonstrate accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies through the use of trait-associated gene modules. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug targets that might be overlooked in traditional single-gene approaches. In summary, our computational framework highlights the importance of focusing on gene expression patterns for a better understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.'

        output: ' Understanding gene function in complex traits demands investigating how genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute their roles. Determining the influence of these genes on various conditions is crucial for devising new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering individual gene associations with disease mechanisms, but modern models highlight the significance of gene-gene interactions in driving diseases. To address this issue, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational method that analyses gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations in a shared latent representation by grouping genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Using PhenoPLIER, we discovered that diseases are significantly related to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, the approach accurately predicts drug-disease connections and elucidates mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we found that functionally important players lacked direct associations yet were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that single-gene approaches may miss potential targets. In conclusion, integrating gene co-expression into genetic association studies via PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing disease etiology and drug mechanisms, enabling the identification of neglected therapeutic targets.'

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data in a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together within specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER''s representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We observe that diseases are associated with these gene modules expressed within relevant cell types; the approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, drug mechanisms, and missing players in trait associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic association analysis, PhenoPLIER can contextualize findings and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework to interpret complex traits through gene expression patterns.'

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease development and progression. PhenoPLIER''s approach is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which are associated with diseases occurring in specific cell types and effectively predict drug-disease associations. Moreover, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation highlights the importance of genes without direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups into PhenoPLIER enables better contextualization of genetic associations and can identify therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic relationships in the context of gene modules.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. The coordinated actions of genes are essential to their functions; determining the impact on complex traits necessitates understanding the regulation of expression across various conditions. Unraveling these intricacies is crucial for developing new therapies, as it enables comprehension of disease-associated mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-related pathways, modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital to the origin and progression of complex traits. The representation of PhenoPLIER is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, enabling us to observe significant associations between diseases and expression patterns in relevant cell types. This approach accurately predicts known drug-disease connections and reveals mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analysis for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking traditional association are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER integrates gene co-expression data to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed in single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for understanding the connections between genetic associations and disease mechanisms through the lens of gene modules.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' The current research introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data in a common latent representation for joint analysis. By understanding how genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts and influence complex traits, we can develop more effective therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but gene-gene interactions are predicted to play a significant role in disease etiology. Traditional models often overlook these essential associations due to focusing on single genes. PhenoPLIER represents modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions and demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with relevant cell type gene expression patterns. The approach also accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation highlights the importance of functionally important players who lack direct trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this novel framework helps contextualize genetic associations through gene co-expression groups, thus revealing potential therapeutic targets previously missed using single-gene strategies.'

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to connect gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions; comprehending how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an understanding of expression regulation across various circumstances.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but current models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in determining the origin and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER''s representation is based on modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for greater insight into associations between diseases and gene modules expressed within relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are not necessarily associated, but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic associations offers contextual insights and can reveal missed targets within traditional single-gene strategies.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
      response:
        output: ' Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute their functions, and elucidating how they influence complex traits necessitates a deep understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing new therapies. Our research demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and identification of targets missed through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes collaborate to execute their functions, necessitating a thorough comprehension of how they regulate expression across distinct conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapeutics. Our research in this study demonstrates that diseases exhibit strong associations with gene modules expressed specifically in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER''s approach, which utilizes groups of co-expressed genes, contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. As a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative method to enhance our understanding in this field.'

        output: ' The complex interplay of genes with each other and in various contexts is essential for understanding their role in influencing traits. Deciphering how these expressions relate to disease requires insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies, especially since previous research has shown that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and can predict known drug-disease pairs. In this study, we developed an approach called PhenoPLIER to further analyze lipid regulation using CRISPR screen data. This method found that functional genes lacking direct associations were prioritized within trait-associated gene expression modules. By incorporating these co-expressed genes into the analysis, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and potentially reveal drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through a comprehensive lens that considers gene expression modules.'

Utilizing CRISPR screening, we found functionally vital players without direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups into the PhenoPLIER framework enables the interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets that may not be detected using single-gene approaches.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across varying conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies as well as gaining knowledge on disease mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, current models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of diseases. To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. Through our findings, we discover that diseases are strongly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate at predicting known drug-disease associations as well as inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation highlights functionally important players that lack direct associations but have strong correlations when included within trait-associated modules. Overall, our work advances the field by incorporating gene-gene interactions and expression patterns to better understand disease etiology and drug mechanisms while revealing new therapeutic targets through novel computational approaches.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on gene modules sharing similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit strong associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs while also revealing mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players without direct associations, but these genes are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, emphasizing its efficiency in identifying potential therapeutic targets and uncovering drug mechanisms.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

        output: ' Genes function together to carry out their tasks within specific contexts, which necessitates understanding how these gene expressions impact complex traits. This comprehension is vital for creating effective treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the involvement of individual genes in disease processes. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in causing and progressing diseases. We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that merges genetic associations, drug data, and gene expression into one unified representation for further analysis. This method is based on groupings of genes with similar expressions across the same conditions, referred to as modules. Our findings demonstrate a strong association between diseases and the modules involved in relevant cell types. We also observe PhenoPLIER''s accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations, providing insight into disease mechanisms. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we found that players without direct genetic links are crucial to the trait, but can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER due to their involvement in relevant gene expression patterns. This innovative approach not only highlights the significance of understanding gene-gene interactions but also showcases the potential value of incorporating expression data in future therapeutic studies.'

To comprehensively understand the influence of these genes on complex traits, a deeper understanding of expression regulation is essential across different conditions. Such knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the etiology and progression of diseases. Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, we map gene-trait associations alongside pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is built upon modules containing genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under particular conditions. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, deciphers mechanisms of action, and also helps prioritize important players without direct associations by featuring them in trait-associated modules. To further demonstrate this approach''s effectiveness, we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, whereby functionally significant genes lacking explicit associations were prioritized based on their presence within PhenoPLIER-constructed gene modules.'

We observe that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen assessing lipid regulation, we found functionally important players without existing associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.'

            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

Identifying the mechanisms underlying this impact is crucial for developing novel therapies and comprehending drug repurposing. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in revealing individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes, modern models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in contributing to disease etiology.

Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, it was discovered that functionally crucial players were not originally linked but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER due to their co-expression. Conclusively, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enhances the interpretation of genetic associations through gene modules, offering a new framework for better understanding and targeting disease mechanisms beyond single-gene approaches.'

This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in unveiling individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease onset and progression. To address this, we present PhenoPLIER - an innovative computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

            text: ' The interplay of genes influences their functions and contributes to the development of complex traits. Unraveling the mechanisms behind gene expression regulation is essential for understanding disease etiology and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in disease-related mechanisms, modern models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in determining the architecture of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with relevant gene modules expressed in specific cell types and demonstrate accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies through the use of trait-associated gene modules. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug targets that might be overlooked in traditional single-gene approaches. In summary, our computational framework highlights the importance of focusing on gene expression patterns for a better understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.'

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data in a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together within specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We observe that diseases are associated with these gene modules expressed within relevant cell types; the approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, drug mechanisms, and missing players in trait associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic association analysis, PhenoPLIER can contextualize findings and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework to interpret complex traits through gene expression patterns.

               This study presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. By analyzing gene expression patterns across different conditions, we aim to gain insight into the complex interplay of genes influencing disease development and drug mechanisms. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been valuable in understanding individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes, it is crucial to consider the role of gene-gene interactions in complex traits' architecture for a comprehensive understanding. PhenoPLIER, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms. We demonstrate its ability to reveal missed potential targets by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules, improving our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a common latent representation for joint analysis. To uncover how genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to understand their expression regulation in specific contexts and across different conditions, as this insight significantly impacts the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models of complex traits emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in determining the etiology and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions, highlighting that diseases exhibit significant associations with relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs as well as elucidate mechanisms of action. Moreover, in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, functionally important players that lack direct associations were prioritized within PhenoPLIER's trait-associated modules, underscoring the significance of gene co-expression in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, offering valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               This study presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into one unified analysis. To understand the role of genes in complex traits, it is crucial to comprehend how they interact under different circumstances for their functionalities. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease development and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which are associated with diseases occurring in specific cell types and effectively predict drug-disease associations. Moreover, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation highlights the importance of genes without direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups into PhenoPLIER enables better contextualization of genetic associations and can identify therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic relationships in the context of gene modules.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. The coordinated actions of genes are essential to their functions; determining the impact on complex traits necessitates understanding the regulation of expression across various conditions. Unraveling these intricacies is crucial for developing new therapies, as it enables comprehension of disease-associated mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-related pathways, modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital to the origin and progression of complex traits. The representation of PhenoPLIER is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, enabling us to observe significant associations between diseases and expression patterns in relevant cell types. This approach accurately predicts known drug-disease connections and reveals mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analysis for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking traditional association are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER integrates gene co-expression data to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed in single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for understanding the connections between genetic associations and disease mechanisms through the lens of gene modules.

               Introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, we mapped gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. By analyzing the expression of genes in various conditions, it becomes essential to understand how they contribute to complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict gene-gene interactions influence the origin and progression of diseases, necessitating an understanding of their roles. PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions to represent gene associations, associating diseases with relevant gene modules expressed in appropriate cell types. Its accuracy in predicting drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms justifies its use for therapeutic targets. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked through single-gene approaches, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic links via gene modules.

               The current research introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data in a common latent representation for joint analysis. By understanding how genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts and influence complex traits, we can develop more effective therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but gene-gene interactions are predicted to play a significant role in disease etiology. Traditional models often overlook these essential associations due to focusing on single genes. PhenoPLIER represents modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions and demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with relevant cell type gene expression patterns. The approach also accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation highlights the importance of functionally important players who lack direct trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this novel framework helps contextualize genetic associations through gene co-expression groups, thus revealing potential therapeutic targets previously missed using single-gene strategies.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to connect gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions; comprehending how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an understanding of expression regulation across various circumstances. A fundamental aspect of this is essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but current models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in determining the origin and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for greater insight into associations between diseases and gene modules expressed within relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are not necessarily associated, but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic associations offers contextual insights and can reveal missed targets within traditional single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for better understanding disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms.

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared representation. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining their influence on complex traits requires understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease origins and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation, based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, shows that diseases are associated with gene modules active in relevant cell types and can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, using CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found functionally important players without associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, and provides a novel framework for interpreting these connections.

               Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute their functions, and elucidating how they influence complex traits necessitates a deep understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing new therapies. Our research demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and identification of targets missed through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific contexts. Achieving a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for grasping how these genes influence complex traits and develop effective treatments. Our research demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with groups of expressed genes in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and uncovers mechanisms of action. By utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players show no direct association but get prioritized within trait-associated gene modules through PhenoPLIER analysis. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER enables contextualizing genetic associations and identifying overlooked therapeutic targets previously missed by single-gene approaches. Thus, PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for deciphering genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Genes interact in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of how they influence complex traits. Accurately predicting therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs depends on elucidating gene expression regulation across various conditions. Our research demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, making our approach accurate for identifying known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we observe that functionally essential players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, which analyzes co-expressed gene groups. By integrating these co-expression modules into the analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers overlooked targets that would otherwise be missed using single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for deciphering genetic associations through an analysis of gene expression patterns in relation to disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions, necessitating a thorough comprehension of how they regulate expression across distinct conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapeutics. Our research in this study demonstrates that diseases exhibit strong associations with gene modules expressed specifically in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's approach, which utilizes groups of co-expressed genes, contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. As a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative method to enhance our understanding in this field.

            text: ' The complex interplay of genes with each other and in various contexts is essential for understanding their role in influencing traits. Deciphering how these expressions relate to disease requires insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies, especially since previous research has shown that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and can predict known drug-disease pairs. In this study, we developed an approach called PhenoPLIER to further analyze lipid regulation using CRISPR screen data. This method found that functional genes lacking direct associations were prioritized within trait-associated gene expression modules. By incorporating these co-expressed genes into the analysis, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and potentially reveal drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through a comprehensive lens that considers gene expression modules.'

               Genes collaborate to carry out their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates investigating expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of new treatments. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting our approach's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis focused on lipid regulation, it is revealed that functionally important players lacking direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our framework, PhenoPLIER serves as a novel tool for contextualizing genetic associations and identifying overlooked targets that might otherwise evade single-gene strategies. Through this approach, PhenoPLIER provides a unique lens for interpreting genetic associations through the understanding of gene modules, thereby contributing to our broader understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to fulfill their roles, necessitating the understanding of how they influence complex traits. To do this effectively, it is vital to comprehend gene expression regulation across various scenarios. This knowledge is crucial for developing effective therapies. Recent work in transcriptome-wide association studies has uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, current models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in the origin and progression of diseases. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that utilizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for a joint analysis through a common latent representation. This representation is based on gene modules sharing similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our results reveal significant disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and unveiling mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes without prior associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns across specific conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players without direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these gene interactions influence complex traits requires knowledge of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies targeting disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate individual genes' roles in relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with relevant cell type gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, and comprehensively understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates the exploration of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is vital for developing new therapies targeting these complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in revealing the roles of individual genes within disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play crucial roles in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairings while inferring their mechanisms of action.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing complex traits. Understanding the expression regulation of these genes across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, our approach reveals a connection between diseases and associated gene modules expressed in crucial cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and sheds light on the mechanisms of action. By analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we found that functionally important players may lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes function synergistically in various contexts to carry out their duties. To comprehensively understand the influence of these genes on complex traits, a deeper understanding of expression regulation is essential across different conditions. Such knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the etiology and progression of diseases. Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, we map gene-trait associations alongside pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is built upon modules containing genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under particular conditions. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, deciphers mechanisms of action, and also helps prioritize important players without direct associations by featuring them in trait-associated modules. To further demonstrate this approach's effectiveness, we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, whereby functionally significant genes lacking explicit associations were prioritized based on their presence within PhenoPLIER-constructed gene modules.

              Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
