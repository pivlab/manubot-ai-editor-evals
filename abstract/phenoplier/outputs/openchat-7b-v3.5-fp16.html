Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00)  The functional interplay between genes in specific contexts is crucial for understanding their roles in complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapies.

Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
