Genetic studies and functional genomics have revolutionized the field of disease etiology, but they face a major challenge in understanding how genes interact with each other to contribute to complex traits. Gene co-expression has been shown to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, and recent advances in transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these approaches often neglect gene-gene interactions, which can obscure potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and can contextualize genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes.

In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Our study aims to address the gap in understanding complex diseases and drug mechanisms by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. In recent years, functional genomics has enabled researchers to identify genes that play a role in disease development and progression. However, this approach lacks the ability to contextualize these findings and provide insights into how these genes interact with each other and with environmental factors. To address this challenge, we have developed a novel method called PhenoPLIER, which clusters genes based on their expression patterns across different conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By providing a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER can facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts.
