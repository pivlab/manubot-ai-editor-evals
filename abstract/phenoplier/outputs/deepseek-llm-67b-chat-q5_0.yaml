          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, we need a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of

          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes

          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Context: Genes act in concert with each other to perform their
          functions, and determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms; however, gene-gene interactions are predicted to play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap highlights
          the need for new approaches that can capture these complex
          interactions.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action using a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules. Our approach can help to identify
          potential therapeutic targets that would be missed by single-gene
          strategies and move our understanding of complex traits forward.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The context section of the abstract needs to introduce the broader
          field and focus on the specific gap that this paper addresses. In this
          case, it should mention how understanding gene-gene interactions is
          critical for developing new therapies but has been overlooked in
          previous studies. The content section can then describe PhenoPLIER as
          a computational approach that fills this gap by mapping genetic
          associations into a common latent representation based on modules of
          co-expressed genes. Finally, the conclusion section should interpret
          these results and highlight how PhenoPLIER moves the field forward by
          providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.


          Revised paragraph: Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in
          complex traits, yet previous studies have largely focused on
          individual genes rather than their interactions with each other. This
          has limited our ability to understand disease mechanisms and develop
          effective therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps genetic associations into a common latent
          representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We observe that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which can help contextualize these
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          In the complex interplay of genetic mechanisms, genes collaborate in

          interactions contribute to complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering
          individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes; however, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the

          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes

          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known

          In complex traits, genes work together to perform their functions in
          specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence expression
          regulation across different conditions is critical for developing new
          therapies and uncovering disease-relevant mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          gene roles, modern models of the architecture of complex traits

          modules, revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies and advancing our understanding of complex trait etiology

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.

          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a

          The complex traits and diseases are influenced by the interaction of
          genes across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, but
          modern models suggest that gene interactions also play a crucial role.
          To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant disease
          association with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs, and inference of
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important players lacking associations using a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules.

          functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. However, there remains a gap in our
          understanding of how to incorporate these interactions into our
          analysis of genetic associations and their implications for drug
          development.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This approach provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, moving the field forward in our understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function
          collectively in specific contexts to execute their roles. To ascertain
          how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to
          comprehend the expression regulation mechanisms across various
          conditions. This comprehension is crucial for developing novel
          therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed significantly to understanding individual gene roles in

          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit significant associations
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important but understudied
          players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to interpret genetic associations

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          indicate that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation hinges on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are strongly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate
          lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed
          gene groups provides valuable context for genetic associations and
          uncovers potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. By interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework that can advance our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. Genes
          function in coordination with one another under specific conditions to
          fulfill their roles. Gaining insight into the regulation of expression
          across diverse contexts is essential for understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits and developing novel therapeutic approaches.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified
          the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, but
          modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical part in disease onset and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of co-expressed
          genes with similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our
          findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, enabling accurate
          predictions of known drug-disease pairs and elucidation of mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant but
          unassociated players were prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides an innovative
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene co-expression modules and unveiling potential therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene approaches.

          The field of genetics has been revolutionized by the identification of
          gene-trait associations, leading to an understanding of individual
          genes' roles in disease development. However, complex traits often
          involve interactions between multiple genes, making it difficult to
          fully grasp their influence on these diseases. This gap highlights a
          need for innovative approaches that can better capture the role of
          gene networks and co-expression patterns in disease etiology.


          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. The approach focuses on
          groups of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant
          conditions. Our study found significant associations between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in related cell types, making PhenoPLIER
          highly accurate in predicting drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. By incorporating co-expressed gene networks into
          the analysis, our method can identify potential therapeutic targets
          that single-gene strategies may miss.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene modules' lens. This approach not
          only contextualizes genetic information but also offers new insights
          into disease mechanisms and potential drug repurposing opportunities.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER is a computational method that merges gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. Genes operate in unison to
          perform their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression
          regulation across varying conditions to discern how they influence
          complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed significantly to the identification of individual genes
          implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models
          posit that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in the onset
          and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is built on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with
          gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen used to examine lipid regulation
          reveals functionally crucial players lacking associations but
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework offers
          a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
          lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In complex diseases, the interactions between genes and their

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together
          in specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding how
          they regulate expression across different conditions is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed to the identification of individual genes involved in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in the onset and progression of
          complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We find that diseases
          are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs

          lacking associations can be prioritized within trait-associated

          groups enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and
          uncover potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis, is introduced. The context of
          this study involves understanding how genes influence complex traits
          by determining the mechanisms behind their expression regulation
          across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have contributed to uncovering individual genes' roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression. Thus, a
          novel method is required to fill this gap in understanding complex
          traits and develop new therapies.


          Here we describe PhenoPLIER's representation based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach reveals
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules. This approach moves the broader field forward by
          highlighting the critical role that gene-gene interactions play in

          Genes function in tandem with one another to carry out their
          individual roles within specific contexts. Understanding the influence
          of these genes on complex traits necessitates a comprehensive
          understanding of expression regulation across various conditions,
          which is crucial for developing novel therapies. In this study, our
          findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while elucidating
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through the analysis of lipid
          regulation using a CRISPR screen, we have found that functionally
          essential genes lacking associations can be prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          provides an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes and revealing potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby contextualizing
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          In the study of complex traits, genes act in concert with each other
          to perform their functions. However, a mechanistic understanding of
          gene expression regulation across different conditions is still
          lacking. This gap limits our ability to develop new therapies and
          understand disease etiology. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by
          studying how gene modules influence complex traits.


          Here we use PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. We also find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER
          when analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens.


          In conclusion, our results demonstrate the potential of incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes to reveal new therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a deeper
          understanding of gene expression patterns and highlights disease
          etiology, ultimately moving us closer to developing effective
          treatments for complex diseases.

          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genes play a crucial role in complex trait regulation by functioning
          together under specific conditions. A comprehensive understanding of
          gene expression regulation across different contexts is vital for
          developing novel therapeutic strategies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a
          CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important genes without direct associations can be
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enables the
          contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Overall, our
          findings suggest that PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through gene module analysis,
          thereby facilitating the identification of new drug repurposing
          opportunities and revealing disease etiology.

          The genetic basis of complex traits and diseases remains largely
          unknown due to a lack of understanding of the functional relationships
          between genes. In this study, we aimed to bridge this gap by
          investigating how gene co-expression patterns can provide insights
          into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we used PhenoPLIER,
          an innovative approach that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes
          to contextualize genetic associations. Our results demonstrate
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, with high accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanism of action. Moreover,
          our CRISPR screen analysis revealed functionally important players
          lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for

          In this study, we explore how genes work together to influence complex
          traits. To do this, we need to understand how gene expression is
          regulated in different conditions. This knowledge is essential for
          developing new therapies. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          strongly connected with specific groups of genes expressed in relevant
          cell types. We have developed a method called PhenoPLIER, which
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, we used CRISPR technology to study lipid
          regulation and discovered that certain important genes lack
          associations but can be identified by analyzing trait-associated
          modules with PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, our approach provides a better understanding of genetic
          associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework

          modules.

          The study of genetic associations is critical for understanding
          disease etiology and developing new therapies. However, determining
          how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This paper aims to fill the gap in literature by providing such an
          understanding through our novel approach, PhenoPLIER. Here we show
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types and demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Our CRISPR screen analysis also reveals that functionally
          important players lacking associations can be prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules provides a significant
          contribution to the broader field of functional genomics and drug
          repurposing, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and
          therapeutic targets.

          The intricate interplay of genes in various contexts underlies their
          functional roles. To understand the influence of these gene networks
          on complex traits, it is essential to examine expression regulation
          across diverse conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and predict known drug-disease relationships
          accurately. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          we identify critical functional players lacking associations but
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. Integrating
          co-expressed genes into the analysis allows PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene approaches. Our novel framework provides
          a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through gene
          module expression patterns.

          The study of how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          However, the literature lacks a method to accurately predict and infer
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action by considering gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. In this paper, we propose
          PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lacking genetic associations can be prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study demonstrates the
          potential for PhenoPLIER to reveal therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, contextualizing genetic associations and
          providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes function in coordination with each other within specific
          contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how these genes
          contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
          of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial
          for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. This study
          presents evidence that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, employing CRISPR screening technology to investigate
          lipid regulation, we have identified functionally important players
          lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed
          gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and
          reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
          modules, enriching our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the context of genetic studies, a gap exists in understanding how
          genes function together to influence complex traits. This knowledge is
          crucial for developing new therapies. To address this gap, our study
          uses functional genomics and gene co-expression analyses to uncover
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations. Our results show significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs, and
          insights into the mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation analysis, we demonstrate how PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations within
          trait-associated modules. Our conclusion reveals that by incorporating
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can identify potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules. This study advances our understanding of complex
          traits and opens new avenues for drug repurposing and target
          identification.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding how they regulate expression across different
          conditions is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying
          complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant processes;
          however, models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression.
          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screens to

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The study of gene-gene interactions in complex traits has been limited

          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across shared conditions. Our findings reveal significant
          disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players
          lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The field of genetics aims to understand how genes work together in
          specific contexts, which is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While individual gene roles have been studied through
          transcriptome-wide association studies, the significance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease origin and progression remains unclear. This
          gap limits our understanding of complex traits and potential
          therapeutic targets. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, we prioritize
          functionally important players lacking associations through a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation, further supporting the relevance
          of PhenoPLIER in trait-associated module identification. These
          findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression
          patterns to better understand disease etiology and potential
          therapeutic targets, advancing our knowledge of complex traits and
          drug repurposing opportunities.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          Understanding how these genes affect complex traits requires a clear
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This knowledge is crucial for developing new treatments.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role
          individual genes play in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models suggest that gene interactions are also important in disease
          origin and progression. 


          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
          specific contexts, requiring a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual gene roles, they
          fall short in capturing the importance of gene-gene interactions in
          disease origin and progression. This paper addresses this gap by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across conditions, diseases are
          significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action, further demonstrated by a CRISPR
          screen analyzing lipid regulation, revealing functionally important
          players prioritized by the approach. Our findings highlight the
          importance of considering gene co-expression patterns to elucidate
          disease etiology and advance therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          There is a growing need for understanding the complex mechanisms of
          gene expression regulation across different conditions to determine
          how genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have made strides in uncovering
          individual gene roles, but modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions are critical to disease origin and progression. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach mapping gene-trait
          associations into modules of co-expressed genes across relevant cell
          types for joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. This
          representation reveals significant association between diseases and
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, using
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations in
          trait-associated modules.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression.


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              implications for understanding disease etiology and identifying

              The context section of the abstract needs to introduce the broader
              field and focus on the specific gap that this paper addresses. In
              this case, it should mention how understanding gene-gene
              interactions is critical for developing new therapies but has been
              overlooked in previous studies. The content section can then
              describe PhenoPLIER as a computational approach that fills this
              gap by mapping genetic associations into a common latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Finally,
              the conclusion section should interpret these results and
              highlight how PhenoPLIER moves the field forward by providing a
              new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules.


              Revised paragraph: Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in
              complex traits, yet previous studies have largely focused on
              individual genes rather than their interactions with each other.
              This has limited our ability to understand disease mechanisms and
              develop effective therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps genetic associations into a
              common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with

              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated

              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, which can help contextualize these associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              In the complex interplay of genetic mechanisms, genes collaborate
              in specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how
              these interactions contribute to complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              aided in uncovering individual gene roles in disease-relevant
              processes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of
              diseases. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across shared conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

              In complex traits, genes work together to perform their functions
              in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence
              expression regulation across different conditions is critical for
              developing new therapies and uncovering disease-relevant
              mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped identify individual gene roles, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits emphasize the importance of
              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurate prediction of known drug-disease
              pairs, and inference of mechanisms of action. PhenoPLIER also
              prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations
              but present in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by
              incorporating co-expressed genes into genetic association
              analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              these associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and
              advancing our understanding of complex trait etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression

              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are

              Context: Genes act in concert with each other to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of
              how to incorporate these interactions into our analysis of genetic
              associations and their implications for drug development.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, moving the field forward in our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function
              collectively in specific contexts to execute their roles. To
              ascertain how these genes influence complex traits, it is
              essential to comprehend the expression regulation mechanisms
              across various conditions. This comprehension is crucial for
              developing novel therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have contributed significantly to
              understanding individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes.
              However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              but understudied players are prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              framework to interpret genetic associations through the lens of
              gene modules.

              Context: The role of gene-gene interactions in the etiology and
              progression of complex diseases is an open question.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
              individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, but modern models
              suggest that these interactions play a crucial role.

            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can

            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often
              work in concert with each other under specific conditions to
              fulfill their functions. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a thorough comprehension of expression
              regulation across various contexts, which is essential for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in identifying individual gene
              roles in disease-related mechanisms. Nonetheless, modern models of
              complex trait architecture indicate that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease origin and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation hinges on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              findings reveal that diseases are strongly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally
              important players lacking associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
              incorporation of co-expressed gene groups provides valuable
              context for genetic associations and uncovers potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework that can advance our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for
              joint analysis. Genes function in coordination with one another
              under specific conditions to fulfill their roles. Gaining insight
              into the regulation of expression across diverse contexts is
              essential for understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits and developing novel therapeutic approaches.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully
              identified the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical part in
              disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
              founded on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression
              patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in pertinent cell types, enabling accurate predictions of known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidation of mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation,
              we discovered that functionally significant but unassociated
              players were prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides an innovative
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene co-expression modules and unveiling potential therapeutic
              targets missed by single-gene approaches.

              The field of genetics has been revolutionized by the
              identification of gene-trait associations, leading to an
              understanding of individual genes' roles in disease development.
              However, complex traits often involve interactions between
              multiple genes, making it difficult to fully grasp their influence
              on these diseases. This gap highlights a need for innovative
              approaches that can better capture the role of gene networks and
              co-expression patterns in disease etiology.


              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
              shared latent representation for joint analysis. The approach
              focuses on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
              relevant conditions. Our study found significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in related cell types,
              making PhenoPLIER highly accurate in predicting drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. By incorporating co-expressed
              gene networks into the analysis, our method can identify potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may miss.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through gene modules' lens. This
              approach not only contextualizes genetic information but also
              offers new insights into disease mechanisms and potential drug
              repurposing opportunities. By incorporating co-expression patterns
              into genetic studies, PhenoPLIER contributes to the broader field
              by providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits'
              etiology, which is essential for advancing therapeutic targets
              discovery and development.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              PhenoPLIER is a computational method that merges gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. Genes operate in unison
              to perform their functions, necessitating an understanding of
              expression regulation across varying conditions to discern how
              they influence complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have contributed significantly to the identification of
              individual genes implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              However, modern models posit that gene-gene interactions play a
              critical role in the onset and progression of diseases.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is built on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We
              demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen used to examine
              lipid regulation reveals functionally crucial players lacking
              associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              innovative framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In complex diseases, the interactions between genes and their
              expression patterns contribute significantly to disease origin and
              progression. However, conventional transcriptome-wide association
              studies have only focused on individual gene associations with
              limited success in understanding these mechanisms. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis, is introduced. The
              context of this study involves understanding how genes influence
              complex traits by determining the mechanisms behind their
              expression regulation across different conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to
              uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial in
              disease origin and progression. Thus, a novel method is required
              to fill this gap in understanding complex traits and develop new
              therapies.


              Here we describe PhenoPLIER's representation based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach
              reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules. Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules. This approach moves the broader
              field forward by highlighting the critical role that gene-gene
              interactions play in disease origin and progression.

              Genes function in tandem with one another to carry out their
              individual roles within specific contexts. Understanding the
              influence of these genes on complex traits necessitates a
              comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              various conditions, which is crucial for developing novel
              therapies. In this study, our findings demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs while elucidating mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, through the analysis of lipid regulation using a
              CRISPR screen, we have found that functionally essential genes
              lacking associations can be prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER provides an

              targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby contextualizing

              In the study of complex traits, genes act in concert with each
              other to perform their functions. However, a mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation across different
              conditions is still lacking. This gap limits our ability to
              develop new therapies and understand disease etiology. In this

              Genes play a crucial role in complex trait regulation by
              functioning together under specific conditions. A comprehensive
              understanding of gene expression regulation across different
              contexts is vital for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Our
              study demonstrates that diseases are strongly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes
              without direct associations can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER
              within trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of
              genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. Overall, our findings

              genetic associations through gene module analysis, thereby
              facilitating the identification of new drug repurposing

              The genetic basis of complex traits and diseases remains largely
              unknown due to a lack of understanding of the functional
              relationships between genes. In this study, we aimed to bridge
              this gap by investigating how gene co-expression patterns can
              provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here,
              we used PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that incorporates
              groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations. Our results demonstrate significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, with high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring their mechanism of action. Moreover, our CRISPR
              screen analysis revealed functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies and advancing our understanding of complex
              traits and diseases.

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In this study, we explore how genes work together to influence
              complex traits. To do this, we need to understand how gene
              expression is regulated in different conditions. This knowledge is
              essential for developing new therapies. Our findings demonstrate
              that diseases are strongly connected with specific groups of genes
              expressed in relevant cell types. We have developed a method
              called PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and identifies mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used
              CRISPR technology to study lipid regulation and discovered that
              certain important genes lack associations but can be identified by
              analyzing trait-associated modules with PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach provides
              a better understanding of genetic associations and reveals
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the analysis of gene modules.

              The intricate interplay of genes in various contexts underlies
              their functional roles. To understand the influence of these gene
              networks on complex traits, it is essential to examine expression
              regulation across diverse conditions. Our findings demonstrate
              that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types and predict known
              drug-disease relationships accurately. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation, we identify critical functional
              players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated modules. Integrating co-expressed genes into the
              analysis allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations,
              revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              approaches. Our novel framework provides a powerful tool for

              The study of how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. However, the literature lacks a method to

              action by considering gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. In this paper, we propose PhenoPLIER as a novel framework

              Genes function in coordination with each other within specific
              contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how these genes
              contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions,
              which is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. This study presents evidence that diseases are
              significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing
              CRISPR screening technology to investigate lipid regulation, we
              have identified functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed
              gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations
              and reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene approaches. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, enriching our understanding of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms.

              In the context of genetic studies, a gap exists in understanding
              how genes function together to influence complex traits. This
              knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. To address this
              gap, our study uses functional genomics and gene co-expression
              analyses to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our
              results show significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurate predictions of
              known drug-disease pairs, and insights into the mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              analysis, we demonstrate how PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important players lacking associations within trait-associated
              modules. Our conclusion reveals that by incorporating co-expressed
              gene groups, PhenoPLIER can identify potential therapeutic targets
              missed by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. This study advances our understanding of complex traits
              and opens new avenues for drug repurposing and target
              identification.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they regulate expression across
              different conditions is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms
              underlying complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant
              processes; however, models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease
              etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly

              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and

              Genes perform their functions in specific contexts through
              coordinated action. Understanding the mechanisms of expression
              regulation across different conditions is crucial for elucidating
              how these genes influence complex traits and developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in the origin and progression of
              diseases. 


              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across shared conditions. Our findings reveal
              significant disease associations with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players lacking direct associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The field of genetics aims to understand how genes work together
              in specific contexts, which is crucial for developing new
              therapies. While individual gene roles have been studied through
              transcriptome-wide association studies, the significance of
              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression remains
              unclear. This gap limits our understanding of complex traits and
              potential therapeutic targets. To address this issue, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait

              important players lacking associations through a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation, further supporting the relevance of
              PhenoPLIER in trait-associated module identification. These
              findings highlight the importance of considering gene
              co-expression patterns to better understand disease etiology and
              potential therapeutic targets, advancing our knowledge of complex

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. Understanding how these genes affect complex traits
              requires a clear understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
              treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover the role individual genes play in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene interactions
              are also important in disease origin and progression. 


              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation

              Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
              specific contexts, requiring a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual gene roles, they fall short in capturing the importance
              of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. This
              paper addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions, diseases are
              significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, further
              demonstrated by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation,
              revealing functionally important players prioritized by the

              There is a growing need for understanding the complex mechanisms
              of gene expression regulation across different conditions to
              determine how genes influence complex traits and develop new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have made
              strides in uncovering individual gene roles, but modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions are critical to disease origin
              and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach mapping gene-trait associations into modules of
              co-expressed genes across relevant cell types for joint analysis
              with pharmacological perturbation data. This representation
              reveals significant association between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
              drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, using
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations in
              trait-associated modules.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
