Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to disease origin and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

 Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of innovative therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

In specific contexts, genes collaborate to perform their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions for elucidating the roles of these genes in complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the contributions of individual genes to disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in determining disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is derived from gene modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

 Genes collaborate to carry out their functions in specific contexts, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions to elucidate how they influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Our research demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential elements lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and identify potential targets that might be missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

 In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact in specific contexts to perform their functions is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind complex traits. This knowledge is also critical for developing new therapies and drug mechanisms. However, current approaches that focus on single genes may miss out on significant insights. Our study aimed to address this gap by proposing a novel method called PhenoPLIER, which identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to determine their association with diseases. Through our results, we demonstrated that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets that might be missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for more effective therapies.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.</td>
