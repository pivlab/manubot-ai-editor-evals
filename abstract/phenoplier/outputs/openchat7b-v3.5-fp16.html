Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires an understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00)  Genes function in concert with each other within specific contexts to perform their roles.

 We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to jointly analyze them in a common latent representation. Genes typically work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions for elucidating the roles of genes in complex traits development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene contributions to disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes under the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which is vital for disease etiology understanding and drug mechanism elucidation.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

 We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. The open question this paper addresses is: how can we develop a method to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes to better understand genetic associations in the context of complex traits? In order to fill this gap, we first developed PhenoPLIER to represent diseases as modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types. We then observed that our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Finally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

 Genetic studies of complex traits have provided an invaluable source of candidate genes that may be involved in the etiology of disease, but many of these associations have remained unexplained. Functional genomics can provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of these traits by considering gene expression patterns across different tissues and cell types. Here we demonstrate how using clustering of complex traits to group genes with similar patterns of co-expression can help identify novel disease targets and infer drug repurposing mechanisms. We show that our PhenoPLIER approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations, highlighting the importance of considering groups of co-expressed genes rather than single genes in isolation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method can be used to prioritize functionally important players within trait-associated modules and reveal potential targets that may have been missed by traditional single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, highlighting the utility of this approach in identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies, and transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential for this approach to shed light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[PASS] (1.00)  Genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions, but determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
