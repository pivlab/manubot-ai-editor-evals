          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits. Such
          insights are pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
          interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon clusters of genes that exhibit coherent
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established
          drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
          lipid regulation, we identify that key functional genes, despite
          lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated
          gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages groups
          of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique
          perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of
          gene expression modules.

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a shared latent space with pharmacological data.
          This method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various
          conditions, enabling a comprehensive analysis of complex traits. Our
          results demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are
          significantly expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of
          diseases by integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might
          overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and
          the identification of novel drug mechanisms, potentially transforming
          functional genomics and precision medicine.

          of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
          lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations,
          yet functionally significant, are identified within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new
          perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of
          gene expression modules.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to
          project genetic associations onto a unified latent space, facilitating
          the analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbations. By analyzing modules of co-expressed genes across
          various conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully
          prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations
          but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
          our understanding of genetic associations by integrating co-expression
          data, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This framework offers a powerful
          tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug
          mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the advancement of functional
          genomics and precision medicine.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under
          consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed
          that key functional genes, despite lacking direct associations, are
          highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize
          genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic associations and
          pharmacological data within a unified latent space. By analyzing

          effectively links diseases to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell

          prioritization of functionally important genes that lack direct

          PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of
          diseases by highlighting the broader significance of gene
          co-expression networks, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug
          repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
          cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed
          upon modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under
          identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell
          types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately predicting established
          drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we reveal that genes of functional significance, despite
          lacking direct associations, are identified within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new
          perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of
          gene expression modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains underexplored.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating the analysis of
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations. Our method
          identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions,
          revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action but
          also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations yet are
          implicated in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          advances our understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits
          by integrating co-expression information, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This
          novel framework offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the
          discovery of drug mechanisms, with broad implications for functional
          genomics and the clustering of complex traits.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for
          comprehensive analysis. Our method relies on the identification of
          gene modules with coherent expression profiles across various
          conditions, enabling the integration of complex trait associations
          with drug response data. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach
          successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as
          validated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of
          diseases by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression
          networks. It offers a powerful framework for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities that may be
          overlooked by single-gene analysis, thereby contributing to the
          precision medicine paradigm.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the
          etiology and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes
          exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our analysis reveals that disease associations are significantly
          enriched within gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The
          method demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that
          PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes that
          lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated gene
          modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by leveraging
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover therapeutic targets that may
          otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a novel perspective for
          interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene modules,
          with implications for disease etiology and drug repurposing.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease development remains underexplored. Here we

          gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data
          into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER leverages gene co-expression modules to capture the
          collective behavior of genes across various conditions, providing
          mechanistic insights into complex trait regulation. Our findings
          demonstrate that disease states are significantly associated with gene

          thereby offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the
          identification of novel therapeutic targets that single-gene
          strategies might overlook. This framework has broad implications for
          the clustering of complex traits and the discovery of drug mechanisms,
          propelling the field of functional genomics forward.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding their collective influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation
          under varying conditions—a crucial aspect for the advancement of novel
          therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex
          diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our findings indicate a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drugs'
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          significant genes within trait-associated modules, even when these
          genes do not exhibit direct associations.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a more
          comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional
          approaches. This novel framework offers a transformative perspective
          for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
          expression modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology
          and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and complex traits is
          pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic
          targets, yet current genetic studies often overlook the intricate
          gene-gene interactions that underpin disease mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of
          individual gene contributions to disease, they fall short in capturing
          the collective influence of gene networks. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by
          integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data within a
          unified latent space, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene
          co-expression modules. Our method leverages the co-expression of gene
          clusters across various conditions, revealing significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
          PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights functionally important
          genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends
          single-gene analysis, offering a powerful framework that
          contextualizes genetic associations within gene networks, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets and informing drug
          repurposing strategies. This approach promises to refine our
          understanding of complex trait clustering and propel functional
          genomics research forward.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing novel therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER leverages gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting
          coherent expression patterns under identical conditions—to construct
          its latent representation. Our analysis reveals that disease states
          are significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent
          cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes
          functionally significant genes that traditional association studies
          might overlook.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expressed gene clusters, thereby enhancing our ability to
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic
          targets that may otherwise remain undetected. This framework offers a
          novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
          prism of gene expression modules, providing valuable insights into
          disease etiology and drug discovery.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that
          integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This model leverages gene
          co-expression modules, capturing the coordinated activity of genes
          across various conditions, to provide mechanistic insights into
          complex trait associations. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms
          of action, with diseases showing significant associations with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the
          utility of our approach in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a
          powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology
          and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach promises to
          advance the clustering of complex traits and facilitate the discovery
          of novel drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of
          functional genomics.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific biological contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene
          expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating
          complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes
          exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
          with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. The method shows
          proficiency in accurately predicting established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
          associations, highlighting them within trait-associated gene modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for
          interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug
          repurposing efforts.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing novel therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation by identifying modules
          of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that these gene modules, particularly when expressed in
          relevant cell types, are significantly correlated with disease states.
          The method exhibits precision in predicting established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally significant genes that may lack direct
          associations, yet are integral to trait-associated modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by leveraging
          clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby enhancing our ability to
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic
          targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel
          paradigm for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of
          gene expression modules, with implications for disease understanding
          and drug discovery.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that
          integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent
          representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbations for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of
          co-expressed genes under similar conditions, enabling the dissection
          of complex trait architectures. Our findings demonstrate that these
          gene modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant
          cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the
          utility of our method. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends
          single-gene analysis by contextualizing genetic associations within
          gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets and
          facilitating drug repurposing. This approach represents a significant
          stride in functional genomics, offering a robust framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and advancing our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we
          discovered that key regulatory genes, despite lacking direct
          associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our
          tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
          identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an
          innovative framework for the interpretation of genetic associations,
          leveraging the concept of gene co-expression to uncover insights into
          disease etiology and inform drug repurposing strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease traits are
          significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is
          achievable with single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are integral to
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in
          functional genomics by providing a powerful tool to contextualize
          genetic associations, thereby highlighting disease etiology and
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          conventional methods. This advancement has broad implications for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, propelling the field
          towards more targeted and effective interventions.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we
          discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. This
          underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
          approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for
          the interpretation of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of
          gene co-expression modules to provide insights into disease etiology
          and inform drug repurposing strategies.

          discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation of
          genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression to
          uncover insights into disease etiology and inform drug repurposing
          efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the regulation of
          gene expression across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating
          the mechanisms underlying complex traits and for the development of
          novel therapeutic interventions. However, a comprehensive method to
          link gene co-expression patterns to disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms remains elusive. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational framework that leverages gene expression data to project
          genetic associations onto networks of co-expressed genes, or gene
          modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes lack
          direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER successfully contextualizes genetic
          associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that are
          overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This framework advances
          our ability to interpret complex genetic data and holds promise for
          identifying novel drug repurposing opportunities and clustering
          complex traits.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits and is pivotal for the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules that are expressed in pertinent cellular environments.
          Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in accurately
          predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
          underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based
          screening focused on lipid regulation, we discovered that certain
          genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct associations,
          are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our analytical
          tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework offers a
          new perspective for interpreting genetic associations via the prism of
          gene expression modules, enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing strategies.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease traits are
          significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is
          achievable with single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes
          lack direct associations, they are nevertheless prioritized within
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in
          functional genomics by providing a powerful tool to contextualize
          genetic associations, thereby highlighting disease etiology and
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          conventional methods. This framework has broad implications for
          enhancing our understanding of complex traits and streamlining the
          drug discovery process.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits and is pivotal for the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening
          focused on lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain genes of
          functional significance, despite lacking direct associations, are
          highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our analytical tool,
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene
          co-expression networks to interpret genetic links, thereby uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          analysis approaches. This innovative framework offers a refined
          perspective for understanding genetic associations via the prism of
          gene expression patterns.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          approaches often overlook the coordinated expression patterns that
          underlie disease mechanisms. This study addresses the gap by
          leveraging gene co-expression to elucidate the genetic basis of
          diseases and identify potential drug targets. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene
          expression profiles with genetic associations to identify
          disease-relevant gene modules and predict drug-disease relationships.
          Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also
          highlighting functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are implicated in disease through co-expression
          networks. By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation as a case
          study, we showcase the ability of PhenoPLIER to prioritize
          trait-associated genes that traditional single-gene approaches might
          miss. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of
          disease etiology by contextualizing genetic associations within gene
          modules but also offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the
          identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the
          field of functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.

          influence of these genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the

          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to

          gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the genesis and progression

          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing

          lipid regulation identified key functional genes that, despite lacking
          direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          models lack a comprehensive approach to elucidate gene-gene
          interactions and their implications in disease etiology. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short in addressing
          the collective influence of gene networks. To bridge this gap, we
          developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations with drug perturbation data into a unified
          latent space, facilitating the analysis of co-expressed gene modules
          under various conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules active in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and provides insights into their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that key regulatory
          genes, although not directly associated with traits, are identified
          within trait-associated modules. This study not only enhances our
          understanding of the genetic basis of diseases but also opens new
          avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic
          targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and the
          clustering of complex traits.

          Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under
          varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes
          on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel
          therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease

          methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be critical and
          are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER,
          underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and
          facilitating drug repurposing.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is pivotal for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          models inadequately capture the essence of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they
          fall short in addressing the collective influence of gene networks. To
          bridge this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          framework that integrates gene-trait associations with drug
          perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating the
          simultaneous analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our results
          demonstrate that these modules, which consist of genes with correlated
          expression patterns in relevant cell types, are significantly
          associated with disease phenotypes. PhenoPLIER not only accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships but also reveals potential
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully
          identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct
          associations with traits, are implicated in disease-relevant pathways,
          as evidenced by a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation. This
          study not only enhances our understanding of the genetic underpinnings
          of complex diseases but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing
          and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to
          the precision medicine paradigm.

          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation indicates that genes lacking direct associations, yet
          crucial for function, are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in highlighting
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex architecture of traits suggests that gene-gene interactions
          are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. This gap in knowledge
          underscores the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across various conditions to develop effective
          therapies. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
          associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes
          under similar conditions, revealing significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates
          potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach
          successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as
          demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of the genetic
          underpinnings of complex traits but also offers a powerful tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing,
          thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
          medicine.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex
          traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. By integrating
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
          constructs a latent space where diseases and drugs converge on shared
          gene expression modules, revealing the cellular contexts in which
          these associations are significant. Our results demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
          provides insights into drug mechanisms of action. Notably, in a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER successfully prioritized key
          regulatory genes that lacked direct associations, underscoring its
          potential to uncover hidden players in disease pathways. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic studies and
          functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for clustering complex
          traits, identifying therapeutic targets, and facilitating drug
          repurposing. This approach promises to enhance our mechanistic
          understanding of disease etiology and inform the development of
          precision medicine strategies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression remains underexplored. This gap hinders the identification
          of novel therapeutic targets and the repurposing of existing drugs.
          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene co-expression patterns to integrate gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent space for
          comprehensive analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed
          genes across various conditions, revealing significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
          PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships but also elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, our approach successfully highlights critical genes that
          lack direct associations with traits but are implicated in
          disease-relevant pathways, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful
          framework for clustering complex traits, uncovering disease etiology,
          and identifying potential therapeutic targets, thereby offering
          valuable insights for drug repurposing and the advancement of
          functional genomics.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits.
              Such insights are pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters
              of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, we identify that key functional genes, despite lacking
              direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene
              clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages groups of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic

              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we
              developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a shared
              latent space with pharmacological data. This method identifies
              modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling
              a comprehensive analysis of complex traits. Our results
              demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of
              diseases by integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might
              overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing
              and the identification of novel drug mechanisms, potentially
              transforming functional genomics and precision medicine.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. Our method shows proficiency in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen
              to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking
              direct associations, yet functionally significant, are identified
              within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
              expression modules.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
              with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and
              elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional
              genes, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative
              framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              development remains underexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression
              patterns to bridge genetic associations and pharmacological data
              within a unified latent space. By analyzing modules of
              co-expressed genes across various conditions, PhenoPLIER
              effectively links diseases to gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships,
              and infers drugs' mechanisms of action. Our findings include the
              prioritization of functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as
              demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
              underpinnings of diseases by highlighting the broader significance
              of gene co-expression networks, thereby offering a powerful tool
              for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic
              targets.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters
              of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation revealed that key functional genes, despite lacking
              direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene
              clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
              collective information of co-expressed gene groups to
              contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
              expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to project genetic associations and
              pharmacological data into a unified latent space for comprehensive
              analysis. Our method relies on the identification of gene modules
              with coherent expression profiles across various conditions,
              enabling the integration of complex trait associations with drug
              response data. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
              and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach
              successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated
              modules, as validated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
              underpinnings of diseases by highlighting the importance of gene
              co-expression networks. It offers a powerful framework for
              identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
              opportunities that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis,
              thereby contributing to the precision medicine paradigm.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal
              for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic
              development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of
              genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our analysis reveals that disease associations are
              significantly enriched within gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively
              prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
              associations but are embedded in trait-associated gene modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              leveraging co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability
              to contextualize genetic associations and uncover therapeutic
              targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a
              novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
              the prism of gene modules, with implications for disease etiology
              and drug repurposing.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, the
              role of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains
              underexplored. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent
              representation, enabling joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages gene
              co-expression modules to capture the collective behavior of genes
              across various conditions, providing mechanistic insights into
              complex trait regulation. Our findings demonstrate that disease
              states are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. The approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
              associations by emphasizing the importance of gene networks,
              thereby offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel therapeutic targets that single-gene
              strategies might overlook. This framework has broad implications
              for the clustering of complex traits and the discovery of drug
              mechanisms, propelling the field of functional genomics forward.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding their collective
              influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight
              into gene expression regulation under varying conditions—a crucial
              aspect for the advancement of novel therapeutic interventions.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms,
              contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
              modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
              across identical conditions. Our findings indicate a significant
              correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in
              identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally significant genes within trait-associated
              modules, even when these genes do not exhibit direct associations.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a
              more comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              conventional approaches. This novel framework offers a
              transformative perspective for interpreting genetic associations
              through the prism of gene expression modules, enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and
              repurposing efforts.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and complex traits is
              pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
              therapeutic targets, yet current genetic studies often overlook
              the intricate gene-gene interactions that underpin disease
              mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              advanced our knowledge of individual gene contributions to
              disease, they fall short in capturing the collective influence of
              gene networks. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological data within a unified latent
              space, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene co-expression
              modules. Our method leverages the co-expression of gene clusters
              across various conditions, revealing significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
              types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated

              uncovering potential therapeutic targets and informing drug
              repurposing strategies. This approach promises to refine our

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER leverages gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting
              coherent expression patterns under identical conditions—to
              construct its latent representation. Our analysis reveals that
              disease states are significantly correlated with gene modules
              active in pertinent cell types. The method demonstrates precision
              in identifying established drug-disease relationships and
              elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER
              effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes that
              traditional association studies might overlook.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expressed gene clusters, thereby enhancing our
              ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise remain
              undetected. This framework offers a novel perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
              expression modules, providing valuable insights into disease
              etiology and drug discovery.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and
              their implications for disease progression remains elusive. Here
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This model leverages gene
              co-expression modules, capturing the coordinated activity of genes
              across various conditions, to provide mechanistic insights into
              complex trait associations. Our findings demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              deciphers mechanisms of action, with diseases showing significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, enhancing our understanding of disease
              etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach
              promises to advance the clustering of complex traits and
              facilitate the discovery of novel drug mechanisms, thereby
              contributing to the broader field of functional genomics.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific biological contexts to
              execute their functions, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of
              genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. The method shows proficiency in accurately predicting
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that lack direct associations, highlighting them
              within trait-associated gene modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability
              to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules,
              providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing efforts.

              Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and
              diseases is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet
              current approaches often overlook the role of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes,
              they fall short in capturing the intricate interplay between genes
              that contributes to disease progression. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and
              pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent space for
              comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of
              co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations with
              diseases in relevant cell types and accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Notably, our
              method also identifies key regulatory genes that lack direct
              associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as
              demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and informing the identification
              of novel therapeutic targets. This framework paves the way for
              drug repurposing and the discovery of drug mechanisms, offering a

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation by identifying
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that these gene modules, particularly when
              expressed in relevant cell types, are significantly correlated
              with disease states. The method exhibits precision in predicting
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that may lack direct associations, yet are
              integral to trait-associated modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby enhancing our
              ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked.
              This approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules, with
              implications for disease understanding and drug discovery.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and
              their implications for disease progression remains elusive.
              Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that leverages a latent representation of
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations for
              joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed
              genes under similar conditions, enabling the dissection of complex
              trait architectures. Our findings demonstrate that these gene
              modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant
              cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a

              prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct

              conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
              repurposing. This approach represents a significant stride in
              functional genomics, offering a robust framework for interpreting

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we discovered that key
              regulatory genes, despite lacking direct associations, are
              highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool,
              PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers
              an innovative framework for the interpretation of genetic
              associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression to
              uncover insights into disease etiology and inform drug repurposing
              strategies.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we discovered that certain
              functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
              traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our
              analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of
              PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets that may
              be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation
              of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene
              co-expression modules to provide insights into disease etiology
              and inform drug repurposing strategies.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a
              powerful tool for contextualizing genetic associations, uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may
              overlook, and thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics
              and drug repurposing.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the regulation
              of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal for
              elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and for the
              development of novel therapeutic interventions. However, a
              comprehensive method to link gene co-expression patterns to
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains elusive. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that
              leverages gene expression data to project genetic associations
              onto networks of co-expressed genes, or gene modules. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that
              while some functionally important genes lack direct associations,
              they are prioritized within trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER successfully contextualizes genetic
              associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that are
              overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This framework
              advances our ability to interpret complex genetic data and holds
              promise for identifying novel drug repurposing opportunities and

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and is
              pivotal for the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our
              study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules that are expressed in pertinent
              cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits
              proficiency in accurately predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid
              regulation, we discovered that certain genes of functional
              significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
              within trait-associated modules by our analytical tool,
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative
              framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations via the prism of gene expression modules, enhancing
              our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing strategies.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              disease traits are significantly correlated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering
              insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses.
              Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that while
              some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they
              are nevertheless prioritized within trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
              providing a powerful tool to contextualize genetic associations,
              thereby highlighting disease etiology and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional
              methods. This framework has broad implications for enhancing our
              understanding of complex traits and streamlining the drug
              discovery process.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet current approaches often overlook the coordinated expression
              patterns that underlie disease mechanisms. This study addresses
              the gap by leveraging gene co-expression to elucidate the genetic
              basis of diseases and identify potential drug targets. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that
              integrates gene expression profiles with genetic associations to
              identify disease-relevant gene modules and predict drug-disease
              relationships. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              while also highlighting functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations but are implicated in disease through
              co-expression networks. By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation as a case study, we showcase the ability of PhenoPLIER
              to prioritize trait-associated genes that traditional single-gene
              approaches might miss. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances
              our understanding of disease etiology by contextualizing genetic
              associations within gene modules but also offers a powerful tool
              for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic
              targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and
              the clustering of complex traits.

              Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the innovation of novel therapeutics.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the genesis and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed
              upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions.
              Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly
              linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              identified key functional genes that, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene
              clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
              therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet current models lack a comprehensive approach to elucidate
              gene-gene interactions and their implications in disease etiology.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short
              in addressing the collective influence of gene networks. To bridge

              targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed
              upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions.
              Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly
              linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              indicates that genes lacking direct associations, yet crucial for
              function, are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex architecture of traits suggests that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. This
              gap in knowledge underscores the need for a mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation across various
              conditions to develop effective therapies. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and
              pharmacological data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes
              under similar conditions, revealing significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated
              in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen
              for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances
              our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex traits
              but also offers a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic
              targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby advancing the
              fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must

              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
              complex traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. By
              integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data,
              PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where diseases and drugs
              converge on shared gene expression modules, revealing the cellular
              contexts in which these associations are significant. Our results
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed
              upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions.
              Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly
              linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be critical
              and are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by
              PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
              targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              and progression remains underexplored. This gap hinders the
              identification of novel therapeutic targets and the repurposing of
              existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to integrate
              gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified
              latent space for comprehensive analysis. Our method identifies
              modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships but also elucidates
              potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach
              successfully highlights critical genes that lack direct
              associations with traits but are implicated in disease-relevant
              pathways, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for
              clustering complex traits, uncovering disease etiology, and
              identifying potential therapeutic targets, thereby offering
              valuable insights for drug repurposing and the advancement of
              functional genomics.

              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
