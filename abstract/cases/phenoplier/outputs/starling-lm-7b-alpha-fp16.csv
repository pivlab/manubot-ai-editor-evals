 In this study, we explore the role of gene-gene interactions in complex traits and disease progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

 We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that synthesizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to carry out their functions; understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates comprehending expression regulation across various conditions. This comprehension is vital for designing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits propose that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease emergence and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for decoding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating the elucidation of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 Genes function in coordinated networks to execute their roles, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across different conditions for deciphering the influence of these genes on complex traits. Such insights are crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for simultaneous analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across varying conditions. This comprehension is vital for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits postulate that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to the origin and progression of diseases.

We discover that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method exhibits accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

 Genes function in coordination with one another in specific contexts to execute their tasks. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches.
