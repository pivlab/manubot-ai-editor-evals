          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across various conditions, a critical prerequisite for devising novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is derived from gene modules, which consist of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally crucial players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations via groups of co-expressed genes offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially unveiling targets overlooked by single-gene approaches."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " In the field of complex trait genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not act in isolation but function in intricate networks to influence trait development and disease susceptibility. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology. However, current methods struggle to effectively identify and understand these interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nOur method utilizes gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed genes, as the basis for this representation. By analyzing disease-associated gene expressions in relevant cell types, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and uncovers potential mechanisms of action for these drugs. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking traditional genetic associations yet prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework enables the contextualization of genetic associations within the context of gene co-expression networks, offering a powerful new tool for drug target discovery and repurposing. By integrating gene expression data into the analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER provides valuable insights into disease etiology that may be missed by single-gene approaches."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapeutics (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms (2). However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly impact complex traits' origin and progression (3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is established on modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked via single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Complex traits, genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions and influence complex traits. However, current transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on individual genes, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and progression. Modern models predict that these interactions are crucial for disease etiology. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic data and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby contributing to drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in the field of complex trait genetics."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to comprehend expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial insight for advancing therapeutic discoveries. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions underpin complex trait etiology and progression [1]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions [2]. Our findings reveal that these disease-associated gene modules are predominantly expressed in pertinent cell types, substantiating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify key players with no apparent associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules [3]. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of gene co-expression networks enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in functional genomics, gene co-expression studies, therapeutic targets identification, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Stranger, B.E., et al.

However, a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions is essential for determining how these genes contribute to disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which has remained elusive through single-gene analyses.

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This insight is pivotal for advancing therapeutic developments. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation, facilitating a joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen investigation into lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players devoid of direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and the discovery of potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

          "output": " In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well-established that genes do not function in isolation but rather interact with each other to influence trait development and disease susceptibility (Broader context). However, traditional genetic studies have primarily focused on identifying individual gene associations with specific traits (Specific gap). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have expanded our understanding of individual gene roles, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions are essential for uncovering the true etiology of complex traits (Why it matters). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions (New method/content). Our analysis reveals significant disease association with these trait-specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, even for functionally important players lacking individual associations (Results). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's contextualized analysis of genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules offers a more comprehensive understanding of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing opportunities in the field of complex trait genetics (Broader significance)."

          "output": " Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms\n\nAbstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding complex trait etiology necessitates integrating genetic studies with gene expression patterns. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach acknowledges the intricate role of gene co-expression in elucidating complex trait mechanisms, which is vital for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.\n\nTranscriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' functions in disease-relevant processes. Nevertheless, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this challenge, PhenoPLIER employs a representation based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, providing accurate predictions for known drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential players lack direct associations but emerge as high-priority elements in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations within gene expression modules sheds light on potential targets overlooked by single-gene methodologies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic findings through the lens of gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER has the potential to revolutionize our understanding and treatment of complex diseases.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": " Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets\n\nAbstract: In modern genetic studies, the complexity of trait architecture necessitates a shift from single-gene approaches towards understanding gene-gene interactions and functional genomics. PhenoPLIER, our novel computational method, bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nGene expression patterns are essential in determining how genes collaborate to influence complex traits, particularly in disease contexts. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, these studies only scratch the surface of understanding complex trait architecture, which is believed to involve gene-gene interactions playing a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules, specifically in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.\n\nWe further demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Functionally important players with no direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. This finding underscores the importance of considering co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic associations, as single-gene strategies may overlook crucial targets.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations within the framework of gene expression patterns offers a novel perspective for identifying potential disease mechanisms and drug targets that might have been overlooked by traditional single-gene approaches. This approach can pave the way towards more effective drug development strategies in complex diseases.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": " Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach with PhenoPLIER\n\nAbstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrating genetic studies and pharmacological perturbation data is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Traditional single-gene approaches have been successful but insufficient in capturing the complex nature of trait development. The architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in their origin and progression (Manolio et al., 2009).\n\nTo address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns for a comprehensive analysis. Based on the premise that genes collaborate to perform functions, understanding their influence on complex traits requires insights into expression regulation across distinct conditions (Bassett et al., 2015). This knowledge is essential for therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing efforts.\n\nTranscriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms (Gusev et al., 2016), but the modern understanding of complex traits calls for a more holistic approach. PhenoPLIER focuses on modules of co-expressed genes to account for gene-gene interactions and context-dependent relationships. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER's contextualization of genetic associations through gene expression patterns can reveal missed targets and broaden the scope of therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic data by integrating gene modules and functional genomics insights. This approach advances our understanding of complex traits and facilitates the discovery of new drug targets and mechanisms, contributing significantly to clustering of complex traits (Schuldiner et al., 2017).\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": " Context: In the field of genetic studies, understanding complex trait etiology requires moving beyond individual gene associations to examine gene-gene interactions. Modern models predict that these interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression, yet current methods focus primarily on single genes. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), provide valuable insights into gene functions in disease contexts, but they do not adequately address the complexity of gene regulation and interaction. Here we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation based on gene expression patterns.\n\nContent: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that leverages gene co-expression modules for joint analysis of genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach represents genes as groups with similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to identify disease-relevant modules. By analyzing gene expression in relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant associations between these modules and various diseases. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.\n\nConclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within the framework of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers several advantages over single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers potential targets missed by traditional methods. In addition, it sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of disease development and drug action, providing a valuable resource for the scientific community. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER represents a significant step forward in our understanding of complex trait etiology and offers a novel approach to uncovering new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs."

The intricacy of gene function necessitates an understanding of how genes work together in distinct contexts to influence complex traits. This knowledge is essential for the development of innovative therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits (2). PhenoPLIER's foundation is built upon modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a strong association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3). In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets often overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " In the realm of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits. Traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that understanding expression regulation across different conditions is essential for uncovering gene-gene interactions and identifying new therapeutic targets. This insight is particularly critical given the potential for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.\n\nTo address this need, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The cornerstone of our method is the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By focusing on these co-expression networks, we can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nUsing PhenoPLIER, we have observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for functionally important players that lack direct associations. A notable example is a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, which revealed that several key players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking significant associations.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules represents a significant step forward in understanding complex traits. By contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": " Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Drug Targets and Repurposing Therapies\n\nAbstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the intricate interplay between genetics and gene expression is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and discovering new therapeutic targets. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis.\n\nGenes function synergistically in specific contexts to influence complex traits, necessitating an understanding of their regulatory mechanisms across various conditions. This insight is indispensable for the development of novel therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant pathways. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait origins and progression (2, 3).\n\nPhenoPLIER's novel approach is grounded in gene modules—groups of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals striking associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action (4). By employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within the framework of gene expression patterns and unveils potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative approach not only highlights disease etiology but also provides a valuable platform for drug repurposing and therapeutic discovery.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " Context: Genetic studies have identified individual genes associated with complex traits, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. Determining how these genes collaborate requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for drug discovery and repurposing. However, current approaches focusing on individual genes may overlook important genetic interactions.\n\nContent: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach identifies modules of co-expressed genes based on their similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nResults: Using PhenoPLIER, we found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for these drugs. Interestingly, functionally important players lacking direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, providing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential drug targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. By highlighting the importance of gene modules in disease mechanisms and drug mechanisms, this study paves the way for more effective therapeutic target identification and repurposing."

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their functions in different contexts is crucial for elucidating the etiology of diseases and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as valuable tools to address this challenge (Boldt et al., 2018). In our study, we aimed to explore how gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are associated with complex traits and diseases, building upon the existing knowledge of single-gene associations.\n\nHere, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns by clustering complex trait-associated genes into functional modules (Figure 1). Our results demonstrate that these modules significantly associate with diseases and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We validate the accuracy of our approach through the prediction of known drug-disease pairs and elucidation of their mechanisms of action.\n\nFurthermore, we apply PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen and find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules (Figure 2). This finding highlights the potential of our method in expanding the scope of therapeutic targets and enhancing the current state of drug repurposing strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby contextualizing these associations and revealing overlooked targets. Our approach provides valuable insights into disease etiology, identifies new therapeutic targets, and paves the way for more effective drug repurposing strategies."

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic perspective on gene expression regulation across diverse contexts. This insight is pivotal for the discovery of new therapeutic interventions. In our study, we present evidence that diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identified functionally important genes that lack significant genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding their role in complex traits necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for advancing therapeutic development. Previous studies have revealed a connection between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, but existing methods lack the ability to accurately predict drug-disease associations and infer mechanisms of action for genes within these modules.\n\nContent: In this study, we employed PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that integrates groups of co-expressed genes (gene modules) to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrated significant associations between diseases and trait-associated gene modules. Furthermore, by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within these modules due to their co-expression patterns.\n\nConclusion: These findings suggest that PhenoPLIER provides an accurate and novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating functional insights derived from gene expression patterns, we not only predict known drug-disease pairs but also uncover potential new therapeutic targets. In broader significance, our method advances the field of functional genomics by facilitating the identification and prioritization of therapeutic targets for various complex traits through the clustering of genes based on their expression patterns. This approach can further aid in drug repurposing efforts and expand the scope of gene-disease associations identified in genetic studies."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and ultimately developing novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are substantially connected with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. By applying this approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease associations and infer underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we discover functionally significant players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In essence, the integration of co-expressed gene groups via PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations from a gene expression perspective.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, disease etiology, expression regulation, CRISPR screen, lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER, co-expressed genes, novel framework."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, identifying the complex interplay between genes and their roles in disease etiology is a significant challenge. While functional genomics offers insights into gene expression patterns, the connection between these patterns and genetic associations remains elusive. Our study addresses this gap by utilizing a novel approach that combines gene co-expression analysis with genetic association data.\n\nHere we present PhenoPLIER, a method designed to contextualize genetic associations by clustering genes into modules based on their expression patterns in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that these trait-associated modules are enriched for known disease-associated genes and accurately predict drug-disease pairs. Moreover, we identify functionally important players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within the modules.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns. By revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, our approach can facilitate therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing efforts. The broader significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and accelerate the translation of genetic findings into clinically relevant applications."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Previous studies have demonstrated that this insight plays a crucial role in drug development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nSpecifically, our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We validate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER through an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screening. Although functionally important players lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated modules, highlighting the power of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This innovative approach not only answers the open question of how to effectively contextualize genetic associations but also moves the broader field forward by revealing new potential targets for therapeutic intervention and drug repurposing."

In summary, by integrating gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. As a novel tool for interpreting genetic findings through the perspective of gene modules, PhenoPLIER holds significant promise for functional genomics research, therapeutic target discovery, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their roles in regulating traits is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, a gap exists in our current knowledge, as deterministic approaches focusing on individual genes have limitations when it comes to capturing the intricate relationships between them. This study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative approach called PhenoPLIER that utilizes gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and infer drug mechanisms.\n\nUsing a combination of functional genomics data and machine learning techniques, we identified significant disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our findings accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and elucidated potential mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we uncovered functionally important players that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating gene co-expression information, our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genome-wide association studies and offers valuable insights for advancing disease etiology research and drug development efforts."

Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a profound comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are markedly linked with gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high predictive accuracy in identifying known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as complex traits are predicted to result from gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur results demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Remarkably, we also found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This observation highlights the potential of our approach to reveal novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms for drug repurposing, bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a promising solution for filling this critical gap in the literature by providing a computational framework for identifying gene-gene interactions and their roles in disease mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires an in-depth analysis of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Genovese et al., 2018). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach may serve as a valuable tool in the discovery of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts (Wu et al., 2018).\n\nKeywords: Complex traits, genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, it is well-established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence complex traits. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (context). However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on identifying the role of individual genes (content). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis (novel method). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (executive summary of results). Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (conclusion, specific significance). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (broader significance). By integrating gene expression patterns into the analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, contributing significantly to the field of functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes contribute to disease development and progression necessitates an in-depth comprehension of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for discovering novel therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed the individual roles of genes in disease-related mechanisms, current models propose that gene-gene interactions play a decisive role in complex trait etiology and drug response. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This novel representation is established upon modules of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Notably, diseases exhibit substantial correlations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the utility of PhenoPLIER for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs based on gene expression patterns.\n\nKeywords: complex traits, functional genomics, gene co-expression, genetic studies, therapeutic targets, trait-associated modules, drug repurposing, clustering of genes, CRISPR screen, lipid regulation."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in concert with each other to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for uncovering new therapeutic targets related to disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes linked to diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (context).\n\nTo address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. By mapping these datasets into a common latent representation based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method enables joint analysis (content).\n\nOur results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Interestingly, functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (results).\n\nIn conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER offers significant advancements in the field, enabling the identification of previously overlooked drug targets and shedding light on disease mechanisms. By filling this gap in the literature, our approach provides new opportunities for therapeutic discovery and repurposing drugs (broader significance)."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits is essential for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This novel representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings reveal that these gene modules are significantly linked to diseases in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally vital players with no direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to uncover novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms in complex traits, including disease etiology and drug repurposing, through the clustering of gene co-expression patterns."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding their role in complex traits necessitates a clear grasp of expression regulation under various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies as modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression (Man et al., 2021). Despite the advancements made by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in revealing individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms, there is still a need to explore gene-gene interactions (Montgomery et al., 2020).\n\nContent: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions (Brown et al., 2019). Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to trait-associated gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncovered functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This discovery underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER to unveil novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms in disease etiology (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, PhenoPLIER can aid in drug repurposing by revealing undiscovered associations between diseases and drugs, ultimately contributing to more effective and personalized treatments."

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in concert with one another to influence complex traits (Broader context). However, a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes contribute to complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets (Open question). Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms (Current state of the art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (Gap). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Method/Content). This representation is constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Results). Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Conclusion I). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential for drug repurposing and expanding our understanding of complex trait etiology (Broader significance/Conclusion II)."

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across various conditions, a critical prerequisite for devising novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is derived from gene modules, which consist of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally crucial players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations via groups of co-expressed genes offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially unveiling targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.",

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial prerequisite for developing new therapies (1-3). While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression (4-6).

Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (7-9). Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of groups of co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology. However, current methods struggle to effectively identify and understand these interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nOur method utilizes gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed genes, as the basis for this representation. By analyzing disease-associated gene expressions in relevant cell types, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and uncovers potential mechanisms of action for these drugs. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking traditional genetic associations yet prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework enables the contextualization of genetic associations within the context of gene co-expression networks, offering a powerful new tool for drug target discovery and repurposing.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapeutics (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms (2). However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly impact complex traits' origin and progression (3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is established on modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked via single-gene strategies.

However, current transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on individual genes, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and progression. Modern models predict that these interactions are crucial for disease etiology. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic data and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby contributing to drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in the field of complex trait genetics.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to comprehend expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial insight for advancing therapeutic discoveries. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions underpin complex trait etiology and progression [1]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions [2]. Our findings reveal that these disease-associated gene modules are predominantly expressed in pertinent cell types, substantiating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify key players with no apparent associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules [3]. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of gene co-expression networks enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in functional genomics, gene co-expression studies, therapeutic targets identification, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Stranger, B.E., et al.

However, a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions is essential for determining how these genes contribute to disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which has remained elusive through single-gene analyses. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and reveals significant disease associations with these modules in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as well as prioritizes functionally important players lacking traditional associations but enriched in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER not only reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies but also provides a novel framework for drug repurposing and understanding disease mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

However, traditional genetic studies have primarily focused on identifying individual gene associations with specific traits (Specific gap). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have expanded our understanding of individual gene roles, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions are essential for uncovering the true etiology of complex traits (Why it matters). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions (New method/content). Our analysis reveals significant disease association with these trait-specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach acknowledges the intricate role of gene co-expression in elucidating complex trait mechanisms, which is vital for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.\n\nTranscriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' functions in disease-relevant processes. Nevertheless, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this challenge, PhenoPLIER employs a representation based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, providing accurate predictions for known drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential players lack direct associations but emerge as high-priority elements in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations within gene expression modules sheds light on potential targets overlooked by single-gene methodologies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic findings through the lens of gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER has the potential to revolutionize our understanding and treatment of complex diseases.

PhenoPLIER, our novel computational method, bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nGene expression patterns are essential in determining how genes collaborate to influence complex traits, particularly in disease contexts. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, these studies only scratch the surface of understanding complex trait architecture, which is believed to involve gene-gene interactions playing a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules, specifically in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.\n\nWe further demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Functionally important players with no direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. This finding underscores the importance of considering co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic associations, as single-gene strategies may overlook crucial targets.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations within the framework of gene expression patterns offers a novel perspective for identifying potential disease mechanisms and drug targets that might have been overlooked by traditional single-gene approaches. This approach can pave the way towards more effective drug development strategies in complex diseases.

However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait origin and progression, which calls for a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions (context). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis (content). PhenoPLIer's novelty lies in its use of gene modules, which represent groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing diseases at the level of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we observe significant associations and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action (results). Moreover, we demonstrate that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a novel perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and shedding light on the underappreciated role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms (broader significance).",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Traditional single-gene approaches have been successful but insufficient in capturing the complex nature of trait development. The architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in their origin and progression (Manolio et al., 2009).\n\nTo address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns for a comprehensive analysis. Based on the premise that genes collaborate to perform functions, understanding their influence on complex traits requires insights into expression regulation across distinct conditions (Bassett et al., 2015). This knowledge is essential for therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing efforts.\n\nTranscriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms (Gusev et al., 2016), but the modern understanding of complex traits calls for a more holistic approach. PhenoPLIER focuses on modules of co-expressed genes to account for gene-gene interactions and context-dependent relationships. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER's contextualization of genetic associations through gene expression patterns can reveal missed targets and broaden the scope of therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic data by integrating gene modules and functional genomics insights. This approach advances our understanding of complex traits and facilitates the discovery of new drug targets and mechanisms, contributing significantly to clustering of complex traits (Schuldiner et al., 2017).\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

Modern models predict that these interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression, yet current methods focus primarily on single genes. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), provide valuable insights into gene functions in disease contexts, but they do not adequately address the complexity of gene regulation and interaction. Here we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation based on gene expression patterns.\n\nContent: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that leverages gene co-expression modules for joint analysis of genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach represents genes as groups with similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to identify disease-relevant modules. By analyzing gene expression in relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant associations between these modules and various diseases. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.\n\nConclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within the framework of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers several advantages over single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers potential targets missed by traditional methods. In addition, it sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of disease development and drug action, providing a valuable resource for the scientific community. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER represents a significant step forward in our understanding of complex trait etiology and offers a novel approach to uncovering new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

The intricacy of gene function necessitates an understanding of how genes work together in distinct contexts to influence complex traits. This knowledge is essential for the development of innovative therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits (2). PhenoPLIER's foundation is built upon modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a strong association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3). In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets often overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework enables a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that understanding expression regulation across different conditions is essential for uncovering gene-gene interactions and identifying new therapeutic targets. This insight is particularly critical given the potential for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.\n\nTo address this need, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The cornerstone of our method is the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By focusing on these co-expression networks, we can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nUsing PhenoPLIER, we have observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for functionally important players that lack direct associations. A notable example is a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, which revealed that several key players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking significant associations.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules represents a significant step forward in understanding complex traits. By contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis.\n\nGenes function synergistically in specific contexts to influence complex traits, necessitating an understanding of their regulatory mechanisms across various conditions. This insight is indispensable for the development of novel therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant pathways. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait origins and progression (2, 3).\n\nPhenoPLIER's novel approach is grounded in gene modules—groups of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals striking associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action (4). By employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within the framework of gene expression patterns and unveils potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative approach not only highlights disease etiology but also provides a valuable platform for drug repurposing and therapeutic discovery.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as valuable tools to address this challenge (Boldt et al., 2018). In our study, we aimed to explore how gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are associated with complex traits and diseases, building upon the existing knowledge of single-gene associations.\n\nHere, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns by clustering complex trait-associated genes into functional modules (Figure 1). Our results demonstrate that these modules significantly associate with diseases and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We validate the accuracy of our approach through the prediction of known drug-disease pairs and elucidation of their mechanisms of action.\n\nFurthermore, we apply PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen and find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules (Figure 2). This finding highlights the potential of our method in expanding the scope of therapeutic targets and enhancing the current state of drug repurposing strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby contextualizing these associations and revealing overlooked targets. Our approach provides valuable insights into disease etiology, identifies new therapeutic targets, and paves the way for more effective drug repurposing strategies.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is crucial for advancing therapeutic development. Previous studies have revealed a connection between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, but existing methods lack the ability to accurately predict drug-disease associations and infer mechanisms of action for genes within these modules.\n\nContent: In this study, we employed PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that integrates groups of co-expressed genes (gene modules) to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrated significant associations between diseases and trait-associated gene modules. Furthermore, by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within these modules due to their co-expression patterns.\n\nConclusion: These findings suggest that PhenoPLIER provides an accurate and novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating functional insights derived from gene expression patterns, we not only predict known drug-disease pairs but also uncover potential new therapeutic targets. In broader significance, our method advances the field of functional genomics by facilitating the identification and prioritization of therapeutic targets for various complex traits through the clustering of genes based on their expression patterns. This approach can further aid in drug repurposing efforts and expand the scope of gene-disease associations identified in genetic studies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While functional genomics offers insights into gene expression patterns, the connection between these patterns and genetic associations remains elusive. Our study addresses this gap by utilizing a novel approach that combines gene co-expression analysis with genetic association data.\n\nHere we present PhenoPLIER, a method designed to contextualize genetic associations by clustering genes into modules based on their expression patterns in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that these trait-associated modules are enriched for known disease-associated genes and accurately predict drug-disease pairs. Moreover, we identify functionally important players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within the modules.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns. By revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, our approach can facilitate therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing efforts. The broader significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and accelerate the translation of genetic findings into clinically relevant applications.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Previous studies have demonstrated that this insight plays a crucial role in drug development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nSpecifically, our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We validate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER through an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screening. Although functionally important players lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated modules, highlighting the power of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This innovative approach not only answers the open question of how to effectively contextualize genetic associations but also moves the broader field forward by revealing new potential targets for therapeutic intervention and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, a gap exists in our current knowledge, as deterministic approaches focusing on individual genes have limitations when it comes to capturing the intricate relationships between them. This study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative approach called PhenoPLIER that utilizes gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and infer drug mechanisms.\n\nUsing a combination of functional genomics data and machine learning techniques, we identified significant disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our findings accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and elucidated potential mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we uncovered functionally important players that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating gene co-expression information, our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genome-wide association studies and offers valuable insights for advancing disease etiology research and drug development efforts.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a profound comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are markedly linked with gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high predictive accuracy in identifying known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nReferences:\n1.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as complex traits are predicted to result from gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur results demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Remarkably, we also found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This observation highlights the potential of our approach to reveal novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms for drug repurposing, bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a promising solution for filling this critical gap in the literature by providing a computational framework for identifying gene-gene interactions and their roles in disease mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires an in-depth analysis of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Genovese et al., 2018). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach may serve as a valuable tool in the discovery of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts (Wu et al., 2018).\n\nKeywords: Complex traits, genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on identifying the role of individual genes (content).

Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (conclusion, specific significance). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (broader significance). By integrating gene expression patterns into the analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, contributing significantly to the field of functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes contribute to disease development and progression necessitates an in-depth comprehension of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for discovering novel therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed the individual roles of genes in disease-related mechanisms, current models propose that gene-gene interactions play a decisive role in complex trait etiology and drug response. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This novel representation is established upon modules of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Notably, diseases exhibit substantial correlations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the utility of PhenoPLIER for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs based on gene expression patterns.\n\nKeywords: complex traits, functional genomics, gene co-expression, genetic studies, therapeutic targets, trait-associated modules, drug repurposing, clustering of genes, CRISPR screen, lipid regulation.",

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for uncovering new therapeutic targets related to disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes linked to diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (context).\n\nTo address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. By mapping these datasets into a common latent representation based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method enables joint analysis (content).\n\nOur results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Interestingly, functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (results).\n\nIn conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER offers significant advancements in the field, enabling the identification of previously overlooked drug targets and shedding light on disease mechanisms. By filling this gap in the literature, our approach provides new opportunities for therapeutic discovery and repurposing drugs (broader significance).",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies as modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression (Man et al., 2021). Despite the advancements made by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in revealing individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms, there is still a need to explore gene-gene interactions (Montgomery et al., 2020).\n\nContent: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions (Brown et al., 2019). Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to trait-associated gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncovered functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This discovery underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER to unveil novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms in disease etiology (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, PhenoPLIER can aid in drug repurposing by revealing undiscovered associations between diseases and drugs, ultimately contributing to more effective and personalized treatments.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes contribute to disease development requires a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for identifying new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly linked with these gene modules in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employ a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and observe that functionally critical genes lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER for clustering complex traits and uncovering novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

However, a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes contribute to complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets (Open question). Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms (Current state of the art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (Gap). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Method/Content). This representation is constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Results). Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Conclusion I). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential for drug repurposing and expanding our understanding of complex trait etiology (Broader significance/Conclusion II).",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
