          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug

          abstract of this manuscript.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

        output: ' Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating their impact on complex traits and discovering new therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method designed to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in modules comprised of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally critical players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER''s ability to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of co-expressed gene modules uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene approaches and offers a novel framework for interpreting complex genetic data.'

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits. However, a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for uncovering their roles in disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the significance of individual genes in disease processes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (context).

          To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis (content). This representation is grounded in modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action (results). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
          associations through co-expressed gene modules reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies and offers a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations (broader significance). This
          approach holds significant implications for the understanding of
          complex trait etiology and drug mechanism discovery.

           Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits is crucial for advancing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contribution to disease mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (2). Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential genes lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3). In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups into PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in the context of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms (4).

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

           Context: Complex traits are influenced by the interplay of multiple genes in specific contexts, making it essential to understand gene expression regulation across different conditions to determine how they contribute to complex traits. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual genes, leaving the exploration of gene-gene interactions unexplored.

          Content: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent
          representation based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that these
          disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in genes
          expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


          Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within
          co-expressed gene modules using PhenoPLIER, we can reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel framework not only
          improves the interpretation of genetic associations but also provides
          a powerful tool for drug repurposing and identifying therapeutic
          targets. This approach moves the broader field forward by enabling the
          identification of functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, thereby
          expanding our understanding of disease etiology and potential drug
          mechanisms.

           Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for deciphering their influence on complex traits and for developing new therapeutic interventions (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms (2, 3). However, current models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression (4). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (5). Furthermore, employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene groups uncovers potential targets that might be missed using single-gene strategies (6). This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations based on gene modules.

           Context: Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits, and identifying how these genes interact is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into individual gene roles in diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression (1). Here, we aim to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

          Content: Specifically, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions to create this
          representation (2). We apply our method to disease associations and
          observe that diseases are significantly enriched in gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach demonstrates high
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, outperforming single-gene strategies.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3).


          Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize
          genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes offers a
          novel framework for interpreting and prioritizing potential
          therapeutic targets that may be missed with single-gene approaches.
          This work provides significant broader significance by highlighting
          the importance of gene expression patterns in understanding disease
          etiology, drug mechanisms, and potential repurposing opportunities.

           Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (3). Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial participants lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In summary, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations, enabling the detection of potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework for deciphering genetic associations via the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in specific contexts through intricate interactions with other genes (Broader Context). Identifying these gene-gene interactions is crucial for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex traits and developing novel therapies (Open Question). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (Specific Gap) (1).

          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Novel
          Method) (2). This representation is based on gene modules, which
          consist of groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. By utilizing these modules, we can contextualize
          genetic associations and potentially identify targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.


          Using this approach, we observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types
          (Content). PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Content).


          In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering
          gene expression patterns and functional interactions for interpreting
          genetic associations (Broader Significance). By incorporating gene
          modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for understanding the
          role of co-expressed genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          This approach holds significant potential for advancing therapeutic
          target identification and drug repurposing efforts.

           Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies and uncovering new drug targets. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and development of complex traits (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This novel approach is grounded in gene modules, which represent groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant genes lacking direct association with traits but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's capacity to analyze groups of co-expressed genes adds depth to genetic associations, potentially unearthing overlooked targets missed by single-gene strategies (2). This innovative framework paves the way for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and expands our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

           In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions (1). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies as modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (2,3). However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on identifying individual genes associated with diseases (4).

          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This innovative
          method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, providing a contextualized understanding
          of genetic associations.


          Using PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (5). Our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of
          lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, we find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (6).


          In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that by incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework offers a significant advancement in
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          highlights the broader significance for drug repurposing and
          clustering of complex traits (7).

           Title: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms through Projected Genetic Associations based on Gene Expression Patterns

          Abstract: In modern genetics research, understanding the intricate
          relationship between genes and complex traits is a major challenge.
          Traditionally, genetic studies have focused on individual gene-trait
          associations; however, recent functional genomics approaches suggest
          that gene co-expression patterns are crucial for elucidating disease
          mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. In this context, we
          present PhenoPLIER – an innovative computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analyses.


          Genes do not function in isolation but rather collaborate within
          specific contexts to execute their functions. This collaboration is
          particularly essential in understanding the etiology of complex
          traits. Drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits are two
          areas where gene expression patterns can provide significant insights,
          as they offer a mechanistic understanding of disease progression and
          potential drug targets.


          PhenoPLIER's methodology is grounded in modules of genes that exhibit
          similar expression patterns across specific conditions. By analyzing
          these modules, we observed that diseases are significantly linked with
          gene modules relevant to their underlying cellular processes.
          Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrated high accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action.


          We further applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation, revealing that functionally important genes lacking
          individual gene-trait associations were prioritized within
          trait-associated modules. This finding highlights the importance of
          gene co-expression patterns in contextualizing genetic associations
          and uncovering potential targets overlooked by single-gene studies.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations by considering the collective impact of groups of
          co-expressed genes. By integrating gene expression data into
          genome-wide association studies, this approach can provide valuable
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that may otherwise
          be missed by traditional single-gene analyses.

           In the field of genetics, identifying the complex interactions between genes and their roles in disease etiology is a pressing challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origin and progression (1). To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

          PhenoPLIER focuses on genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, organized into modules (2). This representation
          allows us to explore the interplay between genes in their functional
          context, an essential step towards understanding disease mechanisms
          and potential therapeutic targets. Preliminary results demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (3).


          Moreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. These
          findings underscore the value of considering groups of co-expressed
          genes, enabling us to contextualize genetic associations and
          potentially uncover targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through gene modules holds significant promise in
          advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing
          (4). This framework not only enhances our ability to identify
          clustered complex traits but also contributes to the development of
          more effective therapeutic strategies.

           Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Integrative Analysis of Gene Expression Patterns and Genetic Associations: An Introduction to PhenoPLIER

          Abstract: In modern genetics research, understanding the intricate
          interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits requires a
          multidisciplinary approach. Towards this goal, we present PhenoPLIER -
          a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for comprehensive analysis.


          Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another
          to execute their roles under distinct contexts. The elucidation of
          these interactions is essential for gaining insights into the
          molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits, which is crucial for
          identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided
          valuable information on individual genes' involvement in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to the origin and development of diseases.


          PhenoPLIER's innovative approach is grounded in the identification of
          gene modules with similar expression patterns across shared
          conditions. By clustering genes based on their co-expression profiles,
          we reveal novel insights into disease associations and drug
          mechanisms. Our methodology shows significant enrichment for diseases
          being associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers underlying mechanisms of action, offering a promising
          alternative to single-gene strategies.


          To validate our approach, we conducted a CRISPR screen analysis on
          lipid regulation and identified functionally important players that
          lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings underscore the
          potential of integrating gene expression data into genetics research
          for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering missed
          targets.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a novel framework that merges
          functional genomics with genetic studies, paving the way for a more
          nuanced understanding of complex traits, drug mechanisms, therapeutic
          targets, and clustering of complex traits.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular

          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Identifying Hidden Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets using PhenoPLIER

          Context: The current era of genetics research is witnessing an
          explosion in data from high-throughput technologies, particularly
          transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pharmacological
          perturbation experiments. However, the complexity of disease
          mechanisms necessitates a deeper understanding of gene-gene
          interactions and their functional roles in various contexts. With
          modern models predicting crucial contributions of these interactions
          to disease etiology and progression, there is a pressing need for
          computational tools that can effectively integrate multiple data types
          to unravel the underlying genetic networks. Here, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel approach aimed at filling this gap.


          Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Leveraging the
          insight that genes function in concert with one another, we represent
          genes based on modules of co-expressed genes across specific
          conditions. We demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies
          disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          accurately predicts known drug-disease associations, and infers
          mechanisms of action for underrepresented functional players. This is
          particularly evident in our analysis of lipid regulation through a
          CRISPR screen, where functionally important players lacking strong
          genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize
          genetic associations within the framework of gene modules enables the
          discovery of potential targets and mechanisms missed by traditional
          single-gene analyses. By bridging the gap between genetics and
          functional genomics, our approach provides a novel platform for drug
          repurposing, therapeutic target identification, and clustering of
          complex traits. Moreover, as this work represents the first step in
          applying PhenoPLIER to various disease domains, we anticipate that it
          will significantly advance our understanding of the underlying genetic
          networks involved in human diseases.

           Title: Uncovering Genetic Associations Through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach Using PhenoPLIER for Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

          Abstract:

          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. This
          methodology recognizes the intricate functional interplay between
          genes in various contexts, which is essential for understanding their
          influence on complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have proven instrumental in elucidating individual gene roles in
          disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's foundation
          lies in the identification of modules consisting of genes with
          comparable expression patterns under similar conditions. We report
          striking associations between these gene modules and diseases
          pertinent to specific cell types. Our methodology demonstrates high
          accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine
          lipid regulation, we discovered functionally critical players that
          lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating
          groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic
          targets often overlooked through single-gene strategies. This
          innovative framework offers a valuable lens for interpreting complex

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

           Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Highlighting Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

          Context: Complex traits, such as diseases, are shaped by the
          interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors. While
          individual gene associations have been identified through
          transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology.
          To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.


          Content: PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules with similar expression
          patterns across conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy by observing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, predicting known drug-disease pairs, and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen
          analyzing lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players
          lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes
          genetic associations within the larger network of co-expressed genes,
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
          integrating gene expression patterns and functional genomics data, our
          approach advances therapeutic target identification and drug
          repurposing, moving the broader field forward towards a more
          comprehensive understanding of complex trait etiology.

           Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach using PhenoPLIER for Disease Mechanisms and Drug Repurposing

          Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the
          intricate interplay between genes and complex traits calls for
          integrative analysis approaches. We present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that harmonizes gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint examination. Genes function synergistically within specific
          contexts to execute their roles in intricate biological processes.
          Deciphering how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates
          a deeper understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions, which is essential for therapeutic development. Although
          transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully
          revealed the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions
          significantly influence disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          foundation lies in modules of co-expressed genes across identical
          conditions, which we demonstrate to be associated with diseases in
          relevant cell types. Our approach displays remarkable accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack
          direct gene-trait associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's
          novel approach incorporates groups of co-expressed genes,
          contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene methodologies. This innovative framework offers
          a valuable tool for interpreting genetic associations in the context
          of gene modules, facilitating drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

           Context: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in the origin and progression of complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that these interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology. However, current methods for analyzing gene-gene interactions often lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations within the larger framework of gene expression regulation.

          Content: Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Using this
          approach, we observe significant associations between disease traits
          and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action.


          Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize
          genetic associations through the analysis of co-expressed gene modules
          provides a novel framework for identifying potential therapeutic
          targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. By integrating
          gene expression data and drug perturbation information, our approach
          offers new opportunities for drug repurposing and clustering complex

           Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach using PhenoPLIER for Identifying Drug Targets and Repurposing

          Abstract: In the quest to elucidate the intricate relationship between
          genes and complex traits, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational
          methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for
          conjoint analysis. Understanding how genes function together in
          specific contexts is essential to decipher their impact on complex
          traits and ultimately discover new therapeutic interventions. Modern
          conceptions of the complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease genesis and progression.


          PhenoPLIER's framework leverages modules of genes sharing similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate
          that these gene modules are significantly linked to diseases in
          relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of predicting known
          drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally essential players with no known
          associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes
          into our analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on
          contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets
          that may be overlooked through single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          paves the way for a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic
          associations in light of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that complex traits are not determined solely by individual genes but rather by their interactions with each other and the environment (Gohr et al., 2017). Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), have uncovered numerous gene-trait associations. However, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression (Barber et al., 2012). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis.

          Our approach capitalizes on the fact that genes act in concert with
          each other, specifically through their expression patterns across
          different conditions (Shah et al., 2015). This insight is crucial for
          understanding complex trait mechanisms and developing new therapies
          (Lage et al., 2017). PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules based on
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our method
          successfully identifies disease associations with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action.


          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack direct associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by
          considering groups of co-expressed genes and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides new insights
          into the clustering of complex traits and offers a valuable tool for
          therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

The ability to mechanistically understand expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as diseases often involve the dysregulation of gene networks (context narrowed). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (executive summary of results). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack single-gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (additional result). In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in understanding complex traits and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance for drug discovery and therapeutic target identification (conclusion with broader significance).'

           Abstract:
          Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits,
          necessitating an in-depth understanding of their expression regulation
          across various conditions for identifying new therapeutic targets. Our
          study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to specific
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology
          accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening to
          investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant
          genes lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
          integration of gene co-expression patterns enables contextualization
          of genetic associations and uncovers potential missed targets using
          single-gene approaches. By providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          facilitates the identification of therapeutic targets and contributes
          to drug repurposing efforts in functional genomics and genetic
          studies, as well as clustering of complex traits.

        output: ' Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under various conditions. Gaining insights into how these genes shape complex traits necessitates a thorough comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts, a critical aspect for advancing therapeutic discoveries. In this study, we demonstrate the significance of diseases being connected to gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology proves effective in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis via PhenoPLIER allows for a more nuanced understanding of genetic associations and the unveiling of potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene approaches. By offering a novel interpretive framework for genetic associations based on gene modules, PhenoPLIER paves the way for functional genomics applications in therapeutic target identification, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.'

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           In the field of genetics, it is widely acknowledged that genes function in complex networks rather than in isolation. Understanding how these genes collaborate to influence complex traits is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, current methods for associating genes with complex traits primarily focus on individual gene analysis, often overlooking the importance of gene co-expression and functional context. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that bridges this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.

          First, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using our method. This
          finding is consistent with the notion that complex traits result from
          the coordinated action of gene networks, rather than individual genes
          acting in isolation. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its
          potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets.


          Next, we apply PhenoPLIER to the analysis of lipid regulation using a
          CRISPR screen. Strikingly, functionally important players lack
          significant associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules, suggesting that these genes' roles may be context-dependent.
          This finding underscores the importance of considering gene
          co-expression and functional context when interpreting genetic
          associations.


          In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by integrating
          groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          novel framework not only advances our understanding of complex trait
          etiology but also provides a valuable tool for drug discovery and
          repurposing.

           Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits, necessitating an in-depth understanding of their expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the discovery of new therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential genes lacking genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIer's integration of groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIer offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

        output: ' In the field of genetic studies, determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies ( context). However, current approaches often focus on individual genes and neglect the collective impact of gene co-expression patterns (gap). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel method that identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and associates them with diseases ( content). Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated modules accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER ( executive summary of results). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies ( answer to the question posed in the context section and broader significance). By bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations, our approach paves the way for functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

           Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Lusis, 2000; Manolio et al., 2009). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is constructed upon gene modules, characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating functional genomics with genetic studies, gene co-expression analyses, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits (Figure 1), our methodology provides valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

           In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in a coordinated manner to influence complex traits. However, identifying how these genes contribute to disease etiology requires a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions (Sachdeva et al., 2017). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

          Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the
          accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally
          important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential
          of our approach for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits
          (Figure 2).


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable contribution to the field
          of functional genomics by enabling the identification of gene
          associations in a systems context. By mapping gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation, we demonstrate accurate prediction of known
          drug-disease pairs and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for
          diseases (Broader Significance). Our findings emphasize the importance
          of considering gene expression patterns in understanding complex trait
          etiology and provide a promising framework for drug discovery and
          repurposing.

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps

          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the individual gene contribution to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for concurrent analysis. This framework utilizes modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions as its basis. Our findings reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in predicting recognized drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players exhibit weak associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, thereby unveiling new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.'

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

           In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2016). A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies (Hood et al., 2012). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Gaulton et al., 2016). However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Boyle et al., 2001; Maher et al., 2013). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. This approach is based on the identification of gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Subramanian et al., 2005).

          Here, we describe our methodology for implementing PhenoPLIER and
          present the results demonstrating that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players
          that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap in the literature (the
          limited understanding of gene interactions in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms), our work provides a powerful tool for therapeutic
          target discovery and drug repurposing, ultimately moving the broader
          field forward.

           Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles, and comprehending how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for simultaneous analysis. This representation is derived from gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally vital players exhibit no direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Revised paragraph:

           In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather collaborate with one another to influence complex traits (Broader context). However, determining how these gene interactions contribute to disease etiology has proven challenging due to the complexity of expression regulation across various conditions (Narrower context). Previous studies have utilized transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Current state of art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Specific gap).

          To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER – a computational approach
          designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis (Content: novel method). This innovative approach is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, allowing us to identify gene interactions that may be
          crucial in disease etiology (Executive summary of results). Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action, demonstrating its utility for both disease association studies
          and drug repurposing efforts (Further evidence).


          Moreover, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation. Strikingly, functionally important players lacking direct
          associations with traits are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions
          for disease prediction (Additional insight). Ultimately, our findings
          underscore the significance of integrating gene expression patterns
          and pharmacological perturbation data to better understand complex
          disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets (Broader
          significance).

           Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have unveiled the contribution of individual genes to disease mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data concurrently. PhenoPLIER constructs a shared latent representation of these datasets based on clusters of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to these gene modules in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking explicit associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This discovery highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER in expanding our understanding of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather work in concert to influence complex traits. However, a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across different conditions is crucial for identifying disease-relevant mechanisms and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap in the literature, our approach
          provides a valuable tool for functional genomics and drug repurposing,
          enabling the clustering of complex traits based on their underlying
          gene expression patterns and highlighting potential therapeutic
          targets.

           Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex phenotypes necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits (1). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is anchored in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We report that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method successfully predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate that functionally vital players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation (2).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Revised paragraph:

           In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits and perform their functions (Broader context). However, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is necessary to determine how these genes contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms (Narrowed context, Open question). Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet current approaches primarily focus on individual gene associations (Specific gap).

          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Content,
          Novel method). This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Content,
          Executive summary of results), allowing us to identify diseases
          associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action (Content, Results).


          Moreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation and discovered that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules (Conclusion, Broader significance). This finding highlights
          the importance of considering gene expression patterns and
          interactions for understanding disease etiology and identifying
          potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating their impact on complex traits and discovering new therapeutic targets.

               In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits. However, a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for uncovering their roles in disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the significance of individual genes in disease processes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (context).

              To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis (content). This representation
              is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (results).
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation,
              we identified functionally important players lacking associations
              but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
              associations through co-expressed gene modules reveals potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies and offers a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations (broader
              significance). This approach holds significant implications for
              the understanding of complex trait etiology and drug mechanism

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits is crucial for advancing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contribution to disease mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (2). Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential genes lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3). In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups into PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in the context of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms (4).

               Context: Complex traits are influenced by the interplay of multiple genes in specific contexts, making it essential to understand gene expression regulation across different conditions to determine how they contribute to complex traits. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual genes, leaving the exploration of gene-gene interactions unexplored.

              Content: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common
              latent representation based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show
              that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly
              enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action.


              Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within
              co-expressed gene modules using PhenoPLIER, we can reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel
              framework not only improves the interpretation of genetic
              associations but also provides a powerful tool for drug
              repurposing and identifying therapeutic targets. This approach
              moves the broader field forward by enabling the identification of
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules, thereby expanding our
              understanding of disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms.

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for deciphering their influence on complex traits and for developing new therapeutic interventions (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms (2, 3). However, current models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression (4). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (5). Furthermore, employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene groups uncovers potential targets that might be missed using single-gene strategies (6). This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations based on gene modules.

               Context: Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits, and identifying how these genes interact is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into individual gene roles in diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression (1). Here, we aim to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

              Content: Specifically, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions to create
              this representation (2). We apply our method to disease
              associations and observe that diseases are significantly enriched
              in gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action, outperforming single-gene
              strategies. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER (3).


              Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize
              genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes offers a
              novel framework for interpreting and prioritizing potential
              therapeutic targets that may be missed with single-gene
              approaches. This work provides significant broader significance by
              highlighting the importance of gene expression patterns in
              understanding disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and potential

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (3). Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial participants lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In summary, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations, enabling the detection of potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework for deciphering genetic associations via the lens of gene modules.

               In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in specific contexts through intricate interactions with other genes (Broader Context). Identifying these gene-gene interactions is crucial for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex traits and developing novel therapies (Open Question). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (Specific Gap) (1).

              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis (Novel Method) (2). This representation is based on gene
              modules, which consist of groups of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. By utilizing these modules,
              we can contextualize genetic associations and potentially identify
              targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Using this approach, we observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types
              (Content). PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking individual associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Content).


              In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of
              considering gene expression patterns and functional interactions
              for interpreting genetic associations (Broader Significance). By
              incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework
              for understanding the role of co-expressed genes in disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach holds significant
              potential for advancing therapeutic target identification and drug
              repurposing efforts.

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies and uncovering new drug targets. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and development of complex traits (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This novel approach is grounded in gene modules, which represent groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant genes lacking direct association with traits but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's capacity to analyze groups of co-expressed genes adds depth to genetic associations, potentially unearthing overlooked targets missed by single-gene strategies (2). This innovative framework paves the way for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and expands our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions (1). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies as modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (2,3). However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on identifying individual genes associated with diseases (4).

              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              innovative method identifies modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, providing a

              Using PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly

              Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs

              of lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are

              In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that by incorporating

               Title: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms through Projected Genetic Associations based on Gene Expression Patterns

              Abstract: In modern genetics research, understanding the intricate
              relationship between genes and complex traits is a major
              challenge. Traditionally, genetic studies have focused on
              individual gene-trait associations; however, recent functional
              genomics approaches suggest that gene co-expression patterns are
              crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying
              therapeutic targets. In this context, we present PhenoPLIER – an
              innovative computational method that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation to facilitate joint analyses.


              Genes do not function in isolation but rather collaborate within
              specific contexts to execute their functions. This collaboration
              is particularly essential in understanding the etiology of complex
              traits. Drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits are two
              areas where gene expression patterns can provide significant
              insights, as they offer a mechanistic understanding of disease
              progression and potential drug targets.


              PhenoPLIER's methodology is grounded in modules of genes that
              exhibit similar expression patterns across specific conditions. By
              analyzing these modules, we observed that diseases are
              significantly linked with gene modules relevant to their
              underlying cellular processes. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrated
              high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and
              inferring mechanisms of action.


              We further applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important genes
              lacking individual gene-trait associations were prioritized within
              trait-associated modules. This finding highlights the importance
              of gene co-expression patterns in contextualizing genetic
              associations and uncovering potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene studies.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations by considering the collective impact of
              groups of co-expressed genes. By integrating gene expression data
              into genome-wide association studies, this approach can provide
              valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that
              may otherwise be missed by traditional single-gene analyses.

               In the field of genetics, identifying the complex interactions between genes and their roles in disease etiology is a pressing challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origin and progression (1). To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

              PhenoPLIER focuses on genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions, organized into modules (2). This
              representation allows us to explore the interplay between genes in
              their functional context, an essential step towards understanding
              disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Preliminary
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action (3).


              Moreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              These findings underscore the value of considering groups of
              co-expressed genes, enabling us to contextualize genetic
              associations and potentially uncover targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic
              associations through gene modules holds significant promise in
              advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug
              repurposing (4). This framework not only enhances our ability to
              identify clustered complex traits but also contributes to the
              development of more effective therapeutic strategies.

               Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Integrative Analysis of Gene Expression Patterns and Genetic Associations: An Introduction to PhenoPLIER

              Abstract: In modern genetics research, understanding the intricate
              interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits requires
              a multidisciplinary approach. Towards this goal, we present
              PhenoPLIER - a computational framework that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for comprehensive analysis.


              Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one
              another to execute their roles under distinct contexts. The
              elucidation of these interactions is essential for gaining
              insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits,
              which is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and
              repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies (TWAS) have provided valuable information on individual
              genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to the origin and development of
              diseases.


              PhenoPLIER's innovative approach is grounded in the identification
              of gene modules with similar expression patterns across shared
              conditions. By clustering genes based on their co-expression
              profiles, we reveal novel insights into disease associations and
              drug mechanisms. Our methodology shows significant enrichment for
              diseases being associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers underlying mechanisms of action,
              offering a promising alternative to single-gene strategies.


              To validate our approach, we conducted a CRISPR screen analysis on
              lipid regulation and identified functionally important players
              that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized
              within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings
              underscore the potential of integrating gene expression data into
              genetics research for contextualizing genetic associations and
              uncovering missed targets.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a novel framework that merges
              functional genomics with genetic studies, paving the way for a
              more nuanced understanding of complex traits, drug mechanisms,

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Identifying Hidden Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets using PhenoPLIER

              Context: The current era of genetics research is witnessing an
              explosion in data from high-throughput technologies, particularly
              transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pharmacological
              perturbation experiments. However, the complexity of disease
              mechanisms necessitates a deeper understanding of gene-gene
              interactions and their functional roles in various contexts. With
              modern models predicting crucial contributions of these
              interactions to disease etiology and progression, there is a
              pressing need for computational tools that can effectively
              integrate multiple data types to unravel the underlying genetic
              networks. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel approach aimed at
              filling this gap.


              Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Leveraging
              the insight that genes function in concert with one another, we
              represent genes based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              specific conditions. We demonstrate that our approach successfully
              identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease associations,
              and infers mechanisms of action for underrepresented functional
              players. This is particularly evident in our analysis of lipid
              regulation through a CRISPR screen, where functionally important
              players lacking strong genetic associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize
              genetic associations within the framework of gene modules enables
              the discovery of potential targets and mechanisms missed by
              traditional single-gene analyses. By bridging the gap between
              genetics and functional genomics, our approach provides a novel
              platform for drug repurposing, therapeutic target identification,
              and clustering of complex traits. Moreover, as this work
              represents the first step in applying PhenoPLIER to various
              disease domains, we anticipate that it will significantly advance
              our understanding of the underlying genetic networks involved in
              human diseases.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

               Title: Uncovering Genetic Associations Through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach Using PhenoPLIER for Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

              Abstract:

              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. This
              methodology recognizes the intricate functional interplay between
              genes in various contexts, which is essential for understanding
              their influence on complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have proven instrumental in elucidating individual gene
              roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease onset and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's foundation lies in the identification of modules
              consisting of genes with comparable expression patterns under
              similar conditions. We report striking associations between these
              gene modules and diseases pertinent to specific cell types. Our
              methodology demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we
              discovered functionally critical players that lack direct genetic
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets
              often overlooked through single-gene strategies. This innovative
              framework offers a valuable lens for interpreting complex genetic
              data in the context of gene modules, shedding light on disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Highlighting Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

              Context: Complex traits, such as diseases, are shaped by the
              interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors.
              While individual gene associations have been identified through
              transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              etiology. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis.


              Content: PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules with similar
              expression patterns across conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy
              by observing significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicting known
              drug-disease pairs, and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players lacking direct associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework
              contextualizes genetic associations within the larger network of
              co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. By integrating gene expression patterns
              and functional genomics data, our approach advances therapeutic
              target identification and drug repurposing, moving the broader
              field forward towards a more comprehensive understanding of
              complex trait etiology.

              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach using PhenoPLIER for Disease Mechanisms and Drug Repurposing

              Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the
              intricate interplay between genes and complex traits calls for
              integrative analysis approaches. We present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that harmonizes gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint examination. Genes function
              synergistically within specific contexts to execute their roles in
              intricate biological processes. Deciphering how these genes
              contribute to complex traits necessitates a deeper understanding
              of expression regulation across various conditions, which is
              essential for therapeutic development. Although transcriptome-wide
              association studies (GWAS) have successfully revealed the
              involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly
              influence disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's foundation
              lies in modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions,
              which we demonstrate to be associated with diseases in relevant
              cell types. Our approach displays remarkable accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on
              lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that
              lack direct gene-trait associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER's novel approach incorporates groups of co-expressed
              genes, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing
              potential targets missed by single-gene methodologies. This
              innovative framework offers a valuable tool for interpreting
              genetic associations in the context of gene modules, facilitating
              drug discovery and repurposing efforts. Keywords: Genetic studies,

               Context: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in the origin and progression of complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that these interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology. However, current methods for analyzing gene-gene interactions often lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations within the larger framework of gene expression regulation.

              Content: Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER is based on modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Using this approach, we observe significant
              associations between disease traits and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Additionally, our method accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


              Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize
              genetic associations through the analysis of co-expressed gene
              modules provides a novel framework for identifying potential
              therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              By integrating gene expression data and drug perturbation
              information, our approach offers new opportunities for drug
              repurposing and clustering complex traits based on shared
              molecular mechanisms. This work has broader significance for the
              field of functional genomics and genetic studies, as it highlights
              the importance of considering gene expression patterns in
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach using PhenoPLIER for Identifying Drug Targets and Repurposing

              Abstract: In the quest to elucidate the intricate relationship
              between genes and complex traits, we present PhenoPLIER - a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space
              for conjoint analysis. Understanding how genes function together
              in specific contexts is essential to decipher their impact on
              complex traits and ultimately discover new therapeutic
              interventions. Modern conceptions of the complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease genesis and progression.


              PhenoPLIER's framework leverages modules of genes sharing similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
              indicate that these gene modules are significantly linked to
              diseases in relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of
              predicting known drug-disease associations and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential
              players with no known associations but prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis,
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on contextualizing genetic
              associations and uncovering potential targets that may be
              overlooked through single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER paves the
              way for a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic
              associations in light of gene modules.

               In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that complex traits are not determined solely by individual genes but rather by their interactions with each other and the environment (Gohr et al., 2017). Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), have uncovered numerous gene-trait associations. However, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression (Barber et al., 2012). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis.

              Our approach capitalizes on the fact that genes act in concert
              with each other, specifically through their expression patterns
              across different conditions (Shah et al., 2015). This insight is
              crucial for understanding complex trait mechanisms and developing
              new therapies (Lage et al., 2017). PhenoPLIER represents genes as
              modules based on similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our method successfully identifies disease
              associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers
              mechanisms of action.


              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack direct associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes genetic
              associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes and
              reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              approach provides new insights into the clustering of complex
              traits and offers a valuable tool for therapeutic target discovery
              and drug repurposing.

               Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Gaining insights into how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating their influence on complex traits and discovering novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology effectively predicts established drug-disease associations and uncovers underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identify key players with no known genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of groups of co-expressed genes enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER presents a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules in functional genomics, genetic studies, clustering of complex traits, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and gene co-expression research.

               Abstract:
              Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits,
              necessitating an in-depth understanding of their expression
              regulation across various conditions for identifying new

              significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts known
              drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, employing CRISPR screening to investigate lipid
              regulation, we discovered functionally significant genes lacking
              direct genetic associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of
              gene co-expression patterns enables contextualization of genetic
              associations and uncovers potential missed targets using
              single-gene approaches. By providing a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of therapeutic targets
              and contributes to drug repurposing efforts in functional genomics

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under various conditions. Gaining insights into how these genes shape complex traits necessitates a thorough comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts, a critical aspect for advancing therapeutic discoveries. In this study, we demonstrate the significance of diseases being connected to gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology proves effective in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis via PhenoPLIER allows for a more nuanced understanding of genetic associations and the unveiling of potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene approaches. By offering a novel interpretive framework for genetic associations based on gene modules, PhenoPLIER paves the way for functional genomics applications in therapeutic target identification, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

               In the field of genetics, it is widely acknowledged that genes function in complex networks rather than in isolation. Understanding how these genes collaborate to influence complex traits is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, current methods for associating genes with complex traits primarily focus on individual gene analysis, often overlooking the importance of gene co-expression and functional context. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that bridges this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.

              First, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using our
              method. This finding is consistent with the notion that complex
              traits result from the coordinated action of gene networks, rather
              than individual genes acting in isolation. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action, highlighting its potential for identifying novel
              therapeutic targets.


              Next, we apply PhenoPLIER to the analysis of lipid regulation
              using a CRISPR screen. Strikingly, functionally important players
              lack significant associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules, suggesting that these genes' roles may
              be context-dependent. This finding underscores the importance of
              considering gene co-expression and functional context when
              interpreting genetic associations.


              In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by
              integrating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. This novel framework not only advances our
              understanding of complex trait etiology but also provides a
              valuable tool for drug discovery and repurposing.

               In the field of genetics, understanding how genes collaborate to influence complex traits requires a thorough comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is vital in developing new therapeutic approaches (Context). Previously, it has been demonstrated that disease associations can be identified through analysis of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Open Question). In this study, we utilized the methodology of PhenoPLIER to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action by integrating groups of co-expressed genes (Content). Our results revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Conclusion). The broader significance of this study lies in its ability to improve our understanding of disease etiology and identify new therapeutic targets via drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

               Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits, necessitating an in-depth understanding of their expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the discovery of new therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential genes lacking genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIer's integration of groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIer offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene modules.

               In the field of genetic studies, determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies ( context). However, current approaches often focus on individual genes and neglect the collective impact of gene co-expression patterns (gap). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel method that identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and associates them with diseases ( content). Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated modules accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER ( executive summary of results). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies ( answer to the question posed in the context section and broader significance). By bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations, our approach paves the way for functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

               Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Lusis, 2000; Manolio et al., 2009). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is constructed upon gene modules, characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating functional genomics with genetic studies, gene co-expression analyses, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits (Figure 1), our methodology provides valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.

               In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in a coordinated manner to influence complex traits. However, identifying how these genes contribute to disease etiology requires a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions (Sachdeva et al., 2017). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

              Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating
              the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Furthermore, using
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified
              functionally important players that lacked associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              highlights the potential of our approach for drug repurposing and
              clustering of complex traits (Figure 2).


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable contribution to the
              field of functional genomics by enabling the identification of
              gene associations in a systems context. By mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation, we demonstrate accurate prediction of known
              drug-disease pairs and suggest new potential therapeutic targets
              for diseases (Broader Significance). Our findings emphasize the
              importance of considering gene expression patterns in
              understanding complex trait etiology and provide a promising
              framework for drug discovery and repurposing.

              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions for identifying their influence on disease development and therapeutic target discovery. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the individual gene contribution to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for concurrent analysis. This framework utilizes modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions as its basis. Our findings reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in predicting recognized drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players exhibit weak associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, thereby unveiling new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

               In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2016). A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies (Hood et al., 2012). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Gaulton et al., 2016). However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Boyle et al., 2001; Maher et al., 2013). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. This approach is based on the identification of gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Subramanian et al., 2005).

              Here, we describe our methodology for implementing PhenoPLIER and
              present the results demonstrating that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important
              players that lacked associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap in the
              literature (the limited understanding of gene interactions in
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms), our work provides a
              powerful tool for therapeutic target discovery and drug
              repurposing, ultimately moving the broader field forward.

               Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles, and comprehending how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for simultaneous analysis. This representation is derived from gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally vital players exhibit no direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather collaborate with one another to influence complex traits (Broader context). However, determining how these gene interactions contribute to disease etiology has proven challenging due to the complexity of expression regulation across various conditions (Narrower context). Previous studies have utilized transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Current state of art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Specific gap).

              To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER – a computational
              approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis (Content: novel method). This
              innovative approach is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
              identify gene interactions that may be crucial in disease etiology
              (Executive summary of results). Our method accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              demonstrating its utility for both disease association studies and
              drug repurposing efforts (Further evidence).


              Moreover, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation. Strikingly, functionally important players lacking
              direct associations with traits are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules, highlighting the importance of
              considering gene interactions for disease prediction (Additional
              insight). Ultimately, our findings underscore the significance of
              integrating gene expression patterns and pharmacological
              perturbation data to better understand complex disease mechanisms
              and identify novel therapeutic targets (Broader significance).

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have unveiled the contribution of individual genes to disease mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data concurrently. PhenoPLIER constructs a shared latent representation of these datasets based on clusters of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to these gene modules in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking explicit associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This discovery highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER in expanding our understanding of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

However, a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across different conditions is crucial for identifying disease-relevant mechanisms and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap in the literature, our approach
              provides a valuable tool for functional genomics and drug
              repurposing, enabling the clustering of complex traits based on
              their underlying gene expression patterns and highlighting
              potential therapeutic targets.

               Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex phenotypes necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits (1). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is anchored in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We report that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method successfully predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate that functionally vital players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation (2).

              Keywords: complex traits, functional genomics, gene co-expression,
              therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering.

               In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits and perform their functions (Broader context). However, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is necessary to determine how these genes contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms (Narrowed context, Open question). Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet current approaches primarily focus on individual gene associations (Specific gap).

              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis (Content, Novel method). This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions (Content, Executive summary of results), allowing us to
              identify diseases associated with these gene modules in relevant
              cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Content, Results).


              Moreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation and discovered that functionally important players lack
              individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules (Conclusion, Broader significance). This finding
              highlights the importance of considering gene expression patterns
              and interactions for understanding disease etiology and
              identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
              opportunities.

            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.
