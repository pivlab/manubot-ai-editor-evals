Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene modules reveals potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations and uncovering new therapeutic targets for disease intervention.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather interact with each other to influence complex traits and diseases. However, current approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have primarily focused on identifying individual gene associations with specific traits or diseases. While these studies have provided valuable insights, they often overlook the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for a more mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing these gene modules, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for understudied players that lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing single-gene findings and revealing potential targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, we can shed new light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective therapeutics through functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions is essential, as this insight is crucial for advancing new therapeutic developments (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origination and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions (3).

Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen aimed at investigating lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally vital players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to contextualize genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach moves the broader field forward by revealing potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies (5).

Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for the discovery of new therapies (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression (2).

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By employing this strategy, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (3). Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of groups of co-expressed genes reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This framework provides a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules and offers promising applications in therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing (5).

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with one another within specific contexts to perform their functions (Broderick et al., 2012). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, as this insight is critical for developing new therapies (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007; Maier-Katula and Hirschhorn, 2014).

To address this gap in current knowledge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling the identification of gene-gene interactions (Subramanian et al., 2017).

Using this approach, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and find that it is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Chen et al., 2018).

In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This approach not only moves the field forward by improving our understanding of complex trait etiology but also has broader significance in drug discovery and repurposing (Lee et al., 2018).

Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an examination of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapies (1). Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (3). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally crucial players that lacked associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s integration of groups of co-expressed genes enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed through single-gene strategies (4). By offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, PhenoPLIER extends our understanding of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to perform their roles, particularly in complex traits. However, current approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have primarily focused on identifying individual gene associations with diseases or traits. While these studies have provided valuable insights, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression, which are currently under-explored. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

The core of PhenoPLIER lies in the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. By analyzing these gene modules, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for under-explored targets. For instance, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

By contextualizing genetic associations with co-expressed genes, this approach reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provides valuable insights into disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities. This work moves the field forward by highlighting the importance of understanding gene interactions in complex traits and demonstrating a powerful computational tool for uncovering these interactions.

Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an examination of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for developing novel therapies and uncovering new therapeutic targets (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (3). Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In summary, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms (5).

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to perform their roles in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, as this insight is critical for developing new therapies (1-3). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (4-6). However, current methods for identifying these interactions are limited.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (7-9). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the identification of potential gene-gene interactions.

Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets

Abstract: We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for comprehensive analysis. The intricate interplay between genes is crucial in understanding their roles in complex traits, particularly in the context of disease etiology and therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence the origin and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER&#39;s approach is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that these gene modules are significantly linked to diseases in relevant cell types, demonstrating PhenoPLIER&#39;s accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR screens for lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s novel framework, which contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and co-expression modules, offers a powerful tool for discovering potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provides insights into disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities.

Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Integrative Analysis of Gene Expression Patterns and Genetic Associations using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In modern genetics, understanding the intricate interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits requires a shift from single-gene perspectives to a systemic approach that considers gene expression patterns and interactions. Towards this end, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis.

Genes function cooperatively in various contexts to execute their roles. To decipher how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to gain insights into the regulation of expression across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in pinpointing individual genes implicated in disease mechanisms, recent advances suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits.

PhenoPLIER&#39;s foundation is built on modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly enriched for diseases relevant to their expressed cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we uncover functionally essential players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s innovative approach contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, thereby revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and providing a novel framework for interpreting complex genetic data through the lens of gene modules.

Abstract: In modern genetics, understanding the intricate interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits requires a shift from single-gene perspectives to a systemic approach that considers gene expression patterns and interactions. Towards this end, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis.

Genes function cooperatively in various contexts to execute their roles. To decipher how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to gain insights into the regulation of expression across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in pinpointing individual genes implicated in disease mechanisms, recent advances suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits.

PhenoPLIER's foundation is built on modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly enriched for diseases relevant to their expressed cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we uncover functionally essential players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's innovative approach contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, thereby revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and providing a novel framework for interpreting complex genetic data through the lens of gene modules. Keywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.

In the field of genetic studies, identifying the complex interactions between genes and their roles in disease etiology is a significant challenge. While individual gene associations have been uncovered through transcriptome-wide association studies, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (1). However, current methods for identifying these interactions are limited, as they focus on single genes rather than groups of co-expressed genes.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis (2). Our method is based on the observation that genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. By representing genes as modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER enables the identification of gene-gene interactions and their association with complex traits.

Using PhenoPLIER, we have observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (3). Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for these drugs (4). Additionally, we have found that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s novel framework provides a contextualized understanding of genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. This approach not only reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies but also paves the way for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits (5). By bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for uncovering the underlying mechanisms of disease and identifying new therapeutic targets.

In the field of complex trait research, it is well established that genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions and influence disease mechanisms (Broderick et al., 2016). However, while transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual gene associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2019). To address this gap in our understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

PhenoPLIER is based on the observation that genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions form modules (Barabasi &amp; Oldham, 2011). We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, enabling the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach moves the field forward by providing a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions and their role in disease mechanisms. By bridging the gap between gene expression data and complex trait analysis, PhenoPLIER offers new insights into the development of targeted therapies.

Abstract: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for comprehensive analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait origins and progression. PhenoPLIER&#39;s approach is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions. We discover that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players devoid of associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s integration of groups of co-expressed genes enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Context: In recent years, there has been a surge in genetic studies aimed at understanding the complex etiology of diseases. Transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single-gene associations, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies, as it allows us to identify functional gene modules that are associated with diseases and can serve as therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Content: PhenoPLIER&#39;s novel representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observed that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. For instance, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This new framework not only improves our understanding of disease mechanisms but also facilitates drug repurposing efforts. By clustering complex traits based on their underlying gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER opens new avenues for the discovery of therapeutic targets and the development of personalized treatments.

In the field of complex trait research, it is widely acknowledged that genes do not act in isolation but function in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (2), and current methods focusing on single genes may miss important insights.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (3). By incorporating these groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several applications. First, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (4), and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5).

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules provides a novel framework for interpreting complex trait data and advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms. By revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, PhenoPLIER moves the field forward in developing more effective therapies (6).

Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach with PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In modern genetics, understanding the intricate relationships between genes and complex traits requires a functional genomics perspective. Traditional genetic studies have largely focused on individual gene associations; however, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play pivotal roles in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER, our novel computational approach, bridges the gap between genetics and functional genomics by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis.

Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in biological systems. Determining how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates an understanding of expression regulation under various conditions, which is crucial for therapeutic discovery. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, the architecture of complex traits implies that gene interactions significantly influence their origin and development.

PhenoPLIER&#39;s methodology revolves around modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s innovative framework contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene approaches. This novel methodology offers a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules and provides a valuable resource for functional genomics research, drug discovery, and disease mechanism elucidation.

In the field of complex trait analysis, determining how genes influence disease-relevant mechanisms goes beyond understanding the role of individual genes; modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (1). However, current approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, focus primarily on single gene associations. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (2).

In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to perform their functions, particularly in the context of complex traits (1). Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as powerful tools to gain mechanistic insights into how genes influence complex traits by identifying groups of co-expressed genes that are likely to function together (2). These findings have critical implications for therapeutic development, as understanding the regulatory networks underlying complex traits can lead to the identification of novel drug targets and mechanisms of action (3).

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a new approach for projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. Our method identifies gene modules that are significantly associated with diseases based on their expression patterns in relevant cell types. By using this approach, we were able to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action (4). For example, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen dataset focused on lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules.

In conclusion, our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (5). This approach can help bridge the gap between genetics and functional genomics, providing new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Additionally, PhenoPLIER has broader significance as it can be applied to a wide range of complex traits and may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets for various diseases.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in collaboration with one another to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. However, gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of this insight in revealing disease mechanisms and identifying drug-disease associations. In this study, we address the gap in current literature by presenting an innovative approach that utilizes gene modules to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discovered that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, this study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. These findings contribute to our understanding of complex trait regulation and offer new avenues for therapeutic development in the broader genetics field.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to perform their roles in specific contexts, particularly in the regulation of complex traits. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies as it allows us to gain a mechanistic insight into how genes influence these traits. However, current approaches for identifying gene-disease associations primarily focus on individual genes, leaving a significant gap in our ability to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms.

Here, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel method that contextualizes genetic associations by analyzing groups of co-expressed genes, or gene modules, in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these trait-associated modules, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

To validate the utility of PhenoPLIER, we applied it to analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. Our findings reveal that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential to uncover targets missed by single-gene strategies.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling us to contextualize these associations and gain a deeper understanding of their broader significance in complex trait regulation.

Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under various conditions. Unraveling how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a deep comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic discoveries. In our study, we demonstrate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology proves effective in identifying established drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing CRISPR screening to examine lipid metabolism, we discover functionally significant actors lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2012). However, understanding how these genes contribute to disease etiology requires a deeper insight into expression regulation across various conditions (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as powerful tools to address this challenge (Butler et al., 2008). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel method that bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.

Using gene co-expression data from relevant cell types, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing (Wang et al., 2018). Moreover, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules.

In conclusion, our results reveal the importance of considering groups of co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic associations. By contextualizing these associations with gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER can uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Huang et al., 2019). This novel framework not only advances our understanding of complex trait genetics but also paves the way for new therapeutic discoveries and clustering of seemingly disparate diseases.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their roles in complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential for developing new therapies (Broader context). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Context narrowed). However, current methods lack the ability to effectively analyze these interactions.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Content - novel method). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (Content - results).

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach to uncover novel gene-gene interactions and provide insights into disease mechanisms that were previously unknown (Conclusion - answer to the question posed in the context section).

In summary, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the field as it provides a powerful tool for analyzing gene-gene interactions, which is crucial for understanding the complexities of disease origin and progression. This work moves the broader field forward by enabling the identification of new therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action. (Conclusion - broader significance)

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their roles in complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential for developing new therapies (Broader context). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Context narrowed). However, current methods lack the ability to effectively analyze these interactions.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Content - novel method). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (Content - results).

Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for unraveling their influence on complex traits and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in elucidating individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology for integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules active in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in conjunction with one another under specific conditions to execute their roles in complex traits. A deeper understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various situations is crucial for advancing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes&#39; involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of diseases. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for integrated analysis.

By grouping genes with similar expression patterns under identical conditions into modules, the PhenoPLIER framework constructs a shared representation of these modules. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and the approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, our analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screening uncovers functionally essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By addressing the critical need to better understand gene-gene interactions in complex traits and their implications for disease development, PhenoPLIER significantly advances our understanding of the broader genetics and therapeutic landscapes.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>

Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under specific conditions. Unraveling how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various contexts, which is essential for the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes linked to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits (genetic studies).

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to probe lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This underscores the potential of our methodology in identifying novel therapeutic targets (therapeutic targets) and repurposing existing drugs (drug repurposing). By clustering complex traits based on gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for deciphering disease etiology and drug mechanisms (clustering of complex traits).

In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather work together to influence complex traits. However, our current understanding of how these genes contribute to disease mechanisms remains limited due to the complexity of gene-gene interactions. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease etiology. Nevertheless, modern models suggest that gene co-expression patterns play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which has yet to be fully explored. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

The PhenoPLIER method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling the analysis of these co-expressed gene groups in relation to disease traits and drug mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, providing accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we uncovered functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

By integrating gene expression patterns into the analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs based on their impact on gene co-expression networks. This work extends our understanding of complex trait architecture and moves the field forward by providing a powerful tool for uncovering the underlying mechanisms driving disease and drug response.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions, particularly in specific contexts. The complexity of this gene interaction network is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying various traits, including those relevant to disease. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression. In response to this gap in current knowledge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

The foundation of PhenoPLIER lies in the identification of gene modules, which are groups of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. By analyzing these modules, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

One notable finding from our analysis using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation is that functionally important players often lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This discovery highlights the potential of our approach in uncovering previously overlooked gene interactions and expanding our understanding of complex disease mechanisms.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel solution to bridge the gap between individual gene associations and the role of gene-gene interactions in complex traits and diseases. By providing a more comprehensive perspective on disease mechanisms and potential drug targets, this approach moves the broader field forward in our quest for new therapies and a deeper understanding of genetic regulation.

In the realm of complex traits, genes do not act in isolation but rather collaborate with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions (Broader context). The intricacies of how these genes influence complex traits necessitate a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under varying conditions. This understanding is crucial for advancing therapeutic development (Connection to the gap). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (Context narrowed and specific gap).

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis (Content - introducing method). This representation is constructed using modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns across identical conditions (Content - executive summary of results). We demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action (Conclusion - answering the question posed in context).

Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Second part of conclusion - broader significance). These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to uncover novel drug targets and mechanisms, thereby advancing our knowledge in the field of gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, and functional genomics.

In the realm of complex traits, genes do not act in isolation but rather collaborate with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions (Broader context). The intricacies of how these genes influence complex traits necessitate a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under varying conditions. This understanding is crucial for advancing therapeutic development (Connection to the gap). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (Context narrowed and specific gap).

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis (Content - introducing method). This representation is constructed using modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns across identical conditions (Content - executive summary of results). We demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action (Conclusion - answering the question posed in context).

Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Second part of conclusion - broader significance). These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to uncover novel drug targets and mechanisms, thereby advancing our knowledge in the field of gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, and functional genomics.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, particularly in the context of complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (1, 2). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, they have limitations in capturing the complexity of gene-gene interactions.

To address this gap in current literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the identification of gene-gene interactions that may be missed by traditional methods (3).

Using this method, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, in a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack traditional associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4).

In conclusion, our approach, PhenoPLIER, fills the gap in current literature by providing a novel computational method for identifying gene-gene interactions that are critical for understanding disease mechanisms. This insight moves the broader field forward by enabling the development of more effective therapies based on a deeper understanding of complex trait architecture.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation, but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits. Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches for identifying these interactions are limited.

Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By leveraging these gene co-expression modules, we are able to identify disease associations that may be missed by traditional approaches.

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach for uncovering new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful new tool for understanding the role of gene interactions in complex traits and disease mechanisms. By integrating gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation information, we are able to identify novel associations that may be missed by traditional approaches. This has important implications for drug discovery and repurposing, as well as our broader understanding of disease etiology.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation, but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits. Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches for identifying these interactions are limited.

Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By leveraging these gene co-expression modules, we are able to identify disease associations that may be missed by traditional approaches.

In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts, particularly in relation to complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence such traits through expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for developing novel therapies (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (2). However, current methods lack the capacity to effectively analyze these interactions.

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions (3). By utilizing this approach, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). This finding highlights the significance of our approach in revealing overlooked yet crucial gene interactions and expanding our understanding of disease mechanisms. In summary, PhenoPLIER represents a valuable contribution to the field by enabling comprehensive analysis of gene-gene interactions and their role in complex traits and diseases.
