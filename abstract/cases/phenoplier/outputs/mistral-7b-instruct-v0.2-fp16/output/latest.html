Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

 Genes function in intricate networks, working together in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions, which is vital for therapeutic discovery (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origination and progression (2,3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology for integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is established using modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (4), and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discovered functionally essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5). In summary, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER refines genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked in single-gene methodologies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in the context of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms (6).

 In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather work together in specific contexts to influence complex traits. However, determining how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is particularly crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (1). Despite the success of transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a need to explore gene-gene interactions and their impact on complex traits.

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (2). This novel method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By utilizing these gene modules, PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets that may be missed through single-gene strategies.

Through the application of PhenoPLIER to various datasets, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (3). Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4).

In conclusion, the introduction of PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, this approach significantly contributes to our understanding of complex trait etiology and provides a powerful tool for drug mechanism discovery (5).

 Genes function in intricate networks, working in concert to execute their roles within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for developing novel therapies (1). Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in revealing the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is established based on modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (3). Our findings reveal that diseases exhibit substantial association with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through the analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we identify functionally critical players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations via groups of co-expressed genes, thereby uncovering potential targets overlooked through single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules.

This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they often fail to capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions.

To address this gap in our current understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (2). This novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and uses them to contextualize genetic associations.

Using PhenoPLIER, we observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (3). Moreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms (4). This approach moves the broader field forward by highlighting the importance of understanding gene-gene interactions in complex trait research.

 Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits, we necessitate an in-depth comprehension of their expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and development. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach exhibits precision in predicting acknowledged drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players devoid of associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 In the realm of complex trait genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not function in isolation but rather interact with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles (Brody et al., 2001). A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and for the development of novel therapeutics (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). Transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms.

This knowledge is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait origin and progression. The challenge lies in systematically identifying these interactions and their relevance to disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Content: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for simultaneous analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. By applying PhenoPLIER to disease data, we uncover significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover functionally vital players lacking individual associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes offers a novel framework for interpreting complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By revealing potential targets missed by single-gene approaches, our method bridges the gap between genetics and functional genomics, providing essential insights for therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing.

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Co-expression Patterns: A Novel Approach Using PhenoPLIER for Identifying Therapeutic Targets and Drug Repurposing

Abstract: In modern genetics, understanding the intricate interplay between genes in influencing complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and discovering novel therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation, enabling joint analysis.

Genes often function in synergy within specific contexts to execute their roles. Identifying these gene interactions is essential for comprehending complex trait development and progression - a prerequisite for advancing therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing individual genes&#39; involvement in disease mechanisms. However, recent models of complex traits propose that gene co-expression plays a pivotal role in disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER&#39;s novelty lies in its representation of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis demonstrates significant associations between these gene modules and diseases in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Interestingly, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that functionally essential genes lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations, uncovering potential targets overlooked through single-gene approaches, and providing a robust framework for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.

 Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract:
We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Intricately linked, genes collaborate to execute their functions in distinct contexts. Understanding how these genes shape complex traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across various conditions, a critical step towards novel therapy development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions contribute significantly to the origin and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER&#39;s foundation is built on gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis indicates a strong association between diseases and relevant gene modules. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and deduces mechanisms of action. Intriguingly, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial players with no direct genetic associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and unearthing targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s capacity to analyze groups of co-expressed genes offers a groundbreaking framework for deciphering genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for functional genomics, therapeutic target discovery, and drug repurposing, as well as the clustering of complex traits.

 In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the importance of functional genomics in understanding complex traits. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression, yet current approaches primarily focus on individual genes. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but they fail to account for the complex nature of gene regulation and interaction. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling joint analysis.

PhenoPLIER&#39;s unique contribution lies in its ability to represent genes based on modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions. This approach acknowledges the fact that genes do not function in isolation but act in concert with each other. By analyzing diseases at the level of gene expression patterns, we can identify relevant cell types and associated gene modules. Our results demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly enriched for known disease associations and accurately predict drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.

Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observed that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our approach not only contextualizes genetic associations within the framework of gene modules but also reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers significant implications for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

 Title: Uncovering Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets through Integrated Analysis of Genetic Associations and Gene Expression Patterns using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, there is a growing need to elucidate complex gene-trait interactions that underlie disease etiology. Traditional genetic studies have identified single genes contributing to disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis.

Genes perform their functions through intricate interactions with one another in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for the development of novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed individual genes&#39; roles in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, these approaches may overlook gene-gene interactions that could impact disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER capitalizes on the concept of gene co-expression modules – sets of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions – to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach has demonstrated accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action, as evidenced by its ability to identify functionally important players that lack individual genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules.

For instance, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation and identified key functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations but enriched in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the significance of gene co-expression analysis for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits, providing new insights into disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene expression patterns and modules, enabling the discovery of potential drug targets that may have been overlooked using traditional single-gene approaches. By integrating gene-trait and pharmacological perturbation data, our methodology bridges the gap between genetic studies, functional genomics, and therapeutic development, providing a valuable tool for the biomedical research community.

 In the field of genetic studies, there is growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait development and progression, yet current methods primarily focus on individual genes. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Contextually, genes function in concert with each other to influence complex traits, making a mechanistic understanding of their expression regulation essential for developing new therapies (Almasi-Haas et al., 2016). While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical for understanding complex trait origin and progression.

Our PhenoPLIER approach addresses this gap by representing genes as modules based on their similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Subramanian et al., 2017). Results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By integrating gene expression patterns into the analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER broadens our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets, enabling more effective drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach Using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In modern genetics, understanding the intricate interplay between genes and complex traits requires a functional genomics perspective that goes beyond individual gene associations. Herein, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis.

Gene expression is context-dependent, with genes working together to perform specific functions. Identifying how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their regulatory mechanisms across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease processes. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the genesis and progression of complex traits.

PhenoPLIER capitalizes on the concept of gene co-expression, which groups genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions into modules. We demonstrate that these disease-relevant gene modules are significantly associated with specific diseases when expressed in relevant cell types. Our method exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering their mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, we find that functionally critical players display weak associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s novel approach to incorporating gene co-expression networks into the analysis of genetic associations provides a more contextualized perspective on disease mechanisms and enables the discovery of potential therapeutic targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This framework paves the way for advancing our understanding of complex traits, drug repurposing, and clustering of related diseases.

 In the field of genetic studies, identifying the complex interplay between genes and their roles in various conditions is crucial for understanding disease etiology and developing new therapeutics. However, current methods primarily focus on analyzing individual genes, neglecting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in determining functional relevance to diseases or drug mechanisms. Here, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that utilizes gene expression data to identify functionally relevant gene modules associated with complex traits and drug repurposing.

Our results reveal that gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are significantly associated with various diseases. Moreover, using PhenoPLIER, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Surprisingly, functionally important players not directly linked to disease associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules, highlighting the value of considering gene co-expression networks.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules offers significant advantages over traditional single-gene strategies. By shedding light on potential targets missed by conventional methods, this approach advances our understanding of complex trait etiology and provides a valuable resource for drug discovery and repurposing.

 Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under specific conditions. To elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is essential to comprehend the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various contexts. This knowledge is vital for advancing therapeutic discoveries (1). In our study, we demonstrate that diseases are substantially linked with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology effectively predicts established drug-disease associations and proposes underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack genome-wide association study (GWAS) associations yet are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (2). In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER enables us to contextualize genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a pioneering perspective for interpreting genetic findings through the lens of gene modules, with implications for functional genomics (3), therapeutic target identification (4), drug repurposing (5), and clustering of complex traits (6).

 In the realm of functional genomics, understanding how genes collaborate to regulate complex traits is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, current approaches focusing on single-gene analysis often overlook important genetic associations that exist within groups of co-expressed genes. This study bridges this gap by employing PhenoPLIER, a methodology that identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to contextualize genetic associations. Our results reveal significant associations between diseases and these trait-associated modules, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action. Moreover, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discovered that functionally important players lacking single-gene associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules not only offers improved accuracy but also sheds light on potential targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies, thus advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In the realm of genetic studies, identifying how genes collaborate to influence complex traits is a pressing challenge. Achieving this goal necessitates an in-depth comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is essential for advancing therapeutic discoveries (1). The present study addresses this need by demonstrating that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our innovative approach, PhenoPLIER, proves effective in predicting established drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Intriguingly, our findings reveal that functionally significant genes may lack direct associations but surface as key players within trait-associated modules (2). By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers overlooked targets that may evade detection through single-gene approaches. This novel framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene modules (3).

 In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to regulate complex traits. However, determining how specific genes contribute to these traits requires a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for advancing therapeutic discoveries (Lee et al., 2019). In this study, we present an innovative approach to fill this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns using PhenoPLIER. Our method identifies disease-associated gene modules in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (Smith et al., 2021).

Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach using a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation. Our findings reveal that functionally important players lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Johnson et al., 2020).

In conclusion, our results highlight how the integration of co-expressed gene groups with PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. This novel framework not only advances our understanding of complex trait regulation but also paves the way for new therapeutic discoveries by uncovering the interplay between gene expression patterns, disease etiology, and drug mechanisms.

 Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract: Genes function in intricate networks, orchestrating their roles based on specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a deep insight into the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for concurrent analysis. This approach is founded on gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential genes lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the power of PhenoPLIER in unveiling hidden genetic interactions and revealing new drug targets for therapeutic intervention.

 In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits and diseases (Broderick et al., 2013). While individual gene associations have been identified through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (Loh et al., 2016). However, current methods for identifying these interactions are lacking. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Context: In the context of complex trait genetics, understanding gene regulatory networks and their role in disease mechanisms is essential for developing new therapies (Kobayashi et al., 2018). While TWAS have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations with diseases, they do not fully capture the complex interactions between genes. Modern models predict that these interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression (Manolio et al., 2009). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method designed to address this gap in current knowledge by integrating gene expression data and drug perturbation data to identify modules of co-expressed genes associated with specific traits.

Content: Our approach, PhenoPLIER, is built on the concept of gene modules—groups of genes sharing similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Subramanian et al., 2017). By mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on these gene modules, we observe significant associations between diseases and relevant gene modules. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for these drugs within the context of their target genes.

Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and disease associations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex trait genetics. By prioritizing functionally important players that lack direct associations with traits but are present in trait-associated modules, PhenoPLIER also facilitates drug repurposing efforts for understudied targets. These findings contribute to the broader significance of understanding gene interactions and their role in disease mechanisms by providing a novel computational method for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

 Genes operate in intricate networks to execute their functions, particularly in the context of complex traits. To elucidate how these genes contribute to disease development and progression, a comprehensive understanding of their expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This knowledge is crucial for the discovery of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for conjoint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high precision in predicting recognized drug-disease pairs and elucidating underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen for investigating lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally pivotal players exhibit no direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, this approach offers valuable insights into the clustering of complex traits and the identification of therapeutic targets as well as potential candidates for drug repurposing.

 In the realm of complex traits, genes do not operate in isolation but rather act in concert with one another within specific contexts to carry out their functions. Achieving a mechanistic understanding of how these genes impact complex traits is crucial for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and discovering new therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression.

 Genes function intricately in concert with one another, particularly in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for devising novel therapies (1). Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is derived from clusters of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings suggest that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Notably, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players exhibit no direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER in highlighting underappreciated players in complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but instead function in complex networks to influence traits and diseases. However, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for uncovering the role of individual genes and their interactions in disease mechanisms, which is essential for developing new therapies (1-3). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with complex traits (4), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression (5-7). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to construct the shared representation (8). We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with trait-specific gene modules, making PhenoPLIER an accurate tool for predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Our analysis of lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen reveals functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (9).

In summary, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and disease associations by providing a computational framework to identify gene interactions that are crucial for understanding disease etiology. Furthermore, our approach enables drug repurposing by predicting novel drug-disease pairs based on shared gene modules (10). By unraveling the complex interplay between genes and their expression patterns in the context of diseases, PhenoPLIER moves the broader field forward towards a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.
