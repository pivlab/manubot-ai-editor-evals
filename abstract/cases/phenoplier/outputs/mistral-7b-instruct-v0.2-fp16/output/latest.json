Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating their impact on complex traits and discovering new therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method designed to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in modules comprised of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally critical players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of co-expressed gene modules uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene approaches and offers a novel framework for interpreting complex genetic data."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Context: Complex traits are influenced by the interplay of multiple genes in specific contexts, making it essential to understand gene expression regulation across different conditions to determine how they contribute to complex traits. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual genes, leaving the exploration of gene-gene interactions unexplored.\n\nContent: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within co-expressed gene modules using PhenoPLIER, we can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel framework not only improves the interpretation of genetic associations but also provides a powerful tool for drug repurposing and identifying therapeutic targets. This approach moves the broader field forward by enabling the identification of functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, thereby expanding our understanding of disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for deciphering their influence on complex traits and for developing new therapeutic interventions (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms (2, 3). However, current models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression (4). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (5). Furthermore, employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene groups uncovers potential targets that might be missed using single-gene strategies (6). This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations based on gene modules.\n\nReferences:\n1. Barabasi, A.-L., & Oltvai, Z. N. (2004).

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Context: Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits, and identifying how these genes interact is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into individual gene roles in diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression (1). Here, we aim to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContent: Specifically, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to create this representation (2). We apply our method to disease associations and observe that diseases are significantly enriched in gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, outperforming single-gene strategies. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3).\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes offers a novel framework for interpreting and prioritizing potential therapeutic targets that may be missed with single-gene approaches. This work provides significant broader significance by highlighting the importance of gene expression patterns in understanding disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and potential repurposing opportunities.

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (3). Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial participants lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In summary, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations, enabling the detection of potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework for deciphering genetic associations via the lens of gene modules.\n\nReferences:\n1. Kauppi E, et al.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in specific contexts through intricate interactions with other genes (Broader Context). Identifying these gene-gene interactions is crucial for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex traits and developing novel therapies (Open Question). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (Specific Gap) (1).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Novel Method) (2). This representation is based on gene modules, which consist of groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By utilizing these modules, we can contextualize genetic associations and potentially identify targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nUsing this approach, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Content). PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Content).\n\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering gene expression patterns and functional interactions for interpreting genetic associations (Broader Significance). By incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for understanding the role of co-expressed genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach holds significant potential for advancing therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing efforts."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies and uncovering new drug targets. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and development of complex traits (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This novel approach is grounded in gene modules, which represent groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant genes lacking direct association with traits but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's capacity to analyze groups of co-expressed genes adds depth to genetic associations, potentially unearthing overlooked targets missed by single-gene strategies (2). This innovative framework paves the way for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and expands our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nReferences:\n1.

          "output": " In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions (1). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies as modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (2,3). However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on identifying individual genes associated with diseases (4).\n\nHere, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This innovative method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, providing a contextualized understanding of genetic associations.\n\nUsing PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (5). Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (6).\n\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and highlights the broader significance for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits (7)."

          "output": " Title: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms through Projected Genetic Associations based on Gene Expression Patterns\n\nAbstract: In modern genetics research, understanding the intricate relationship between genes and complex traits is a major challenge. Traditionally, genetic studies have focused on individual gene-trait associations; however, recent functional genomics approaches suggest that gene co-expression patterns are crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. In this context, we present PhenoPLIER – an innovative computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analyses.\n\nGenes do not function in isolation but rather collaborate within specific contexts to execute their functions. This collaboration is particularly essential in understanding the etiology of complex traits. Drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits are two areas where gene expression patterns can provide significant insights, as they offer a mechanistic understanding of disease progression and potential drug targets.\n\nPhenoPLIER's methodology is grounded in modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across specific conditions. By analyzing these modules, we observed that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules relevant to their underlying cellular processes. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrated high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nWe further applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important genes lacking individual gene-trait associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules. This finding highlights the importance of gene co-expression patterns in contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets overlooked by single-gene studies.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by considering the collective impact of groups of co-expressed genes. By integrating gene expression data into genome-wide association studies, this approach can provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that may otherwise be missed by traditional single-gene analyses."

          "output": " In the field of genetics, identifying the complex interactions between genes and their roles in disease etiology is a pressing challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origin and progression (1). To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nPhenoPLIER focuses on genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, organized into modules (2). This representation allows us to explore the interplay between genes in their functional context, an essential step towards understanding disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Preliminary results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (3).\n\nMoreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the value of considering groups of co-expressed genes, enabling us to contextualize genetic associations and potentially uncover targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through gene modules holds significant promise in advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing (4). This framework not only enhances our ability to identify clustered complex traits but also contributes to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Towards this goal, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for comprehensive analysis.\n\nGenes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under distinct contexts. The elucidation of these interactions is essential for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits, which is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable information on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and development of diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative approach is grounded in the identification of gene modules with similar expression patterns across shared conditions. By clustering genes based on their co-expression profiles, we reveal novel insights into disease associations and drug mechanisms. Our methodology shows significant enrichment for diseases being associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers underlying mechanisms of action, offering a promising alternative to single-gene strategies.\n\nTo validate our approach, we conducted a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation and identified functionally important players that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating gene expression data into genetics research for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering missed targets.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a novel framework that merges functional genomics with genetic studies, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of complex traits, drug mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and clustering of complex traits."

          "output": " Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Identifying Hidden Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets using PhenoPLIER\n\nContext: The current era of genetics research is witnessing an explosion in data from high-throughput technologies, particularly transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pharmacological perturbation experiments. However, the complexity of disease mechanisms necessitates a deeper understanding of gene-gene interactions and their functional roles in various contexts. With modern models predicting crucial contributions of these interactions to disease etiology and progression, there is a pressing need for computational tools that can effectively integrate multiple data types to unravel the underlying genetic networks. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel approach aimed at filling this gap.\n\nContent: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Leveraging the insight that genes function in concert with one another, we represent genes based on modules of co-expressed genes across specific conditions. We demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease associations, and infers mechanisms of action for underrepresented functional players. This is particularly evident in our analysis of lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen, where functionally important players lacking strong genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations within the framework of gene modules enables the discovery of potential targets and mechanisms missed by traditional single-gene analyses. By bridging the gap between genetics and functional genomics, our approach provides a novel platform for drug repurposing, therapeutic target identification, and clustering of complex traits. Moreover, as this work represents the first step in applying PhenoPLIER to various disease domains, we anticipate that it will significantly advance our understanding of the underlying genetic networks involved in human diseases."

This methodology recognizes the intricate functional interplay between genes in various contexts, which is essential for understanding their influence on complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have proven instrumental in elucidating individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's foundation lies in the identification of modules consisting of genes with comparable expression patterns under similar conditions. We report striking associations between these gene modules and diseases pertinent to specific cell types. Our methodology demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered functionally critical players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets often overlooked through single-gene strategies. This innovative framework offers a valuable lens for interpreting complex genetic data in the context of gene modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

While individual gene associations have been identified through transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContent: PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that harmonizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint examination. Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute their roles in intricate biological processes. Deciphering how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a deeper understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for therapeutic development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully revealed the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's foundation lies in modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions, which we demonstrate to be associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our approach displays remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack direct gene-trait associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach incorporates groups of co-expressed genes, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene methodologies. This innovative framework offers a valuable tool for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, facilitating drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": " Context: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in the origin and progression of complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that these interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology. However, current methods for analyzing gene-gene interactions often lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations within the larger framework of gene expression regulation.\n\nContent: Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Additionally, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of co-expressed gene modules provides a novel framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. By integrating gene expression data and drug perturbation information, our approach offers new opportunities for drug repurposing and clustering complex traits based on shared molecular mechanisms.

Understanding how genes function together in specific contexts is essential to decipher their impact on complex traits and ultimately discover new therapeutic interventions. Modern conceptions of the complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease genesis and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's framework leverages modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that these gene modules are significantly linked to diseases in relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of predicting known drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players with no known associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER paves the way for a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations in light of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that complex traits are not determined solely by individual genes but rather by their interactions with each other and the environment (Gohr et al., 2017). Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), have uncovered numerous gene-trait associations. However, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression (Barber et al., 2012). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis.\n\nOur approach capitalizes on the fact that genes act in concert with each other, specifically through their expression patterns across different conditions (Shah et al., 2015). This insight is crucial for understanding complex trait mechanisms and developing new therapies (Lage et al., 2017). PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules based on similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our method successfully identifies disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides new insights into the clustering of complex traits and offers a valuable tool for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing."

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other in specific contexts to influence complex traits (context). The ability to mechanistically understand expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as diseases often involve the dysregulation of gene networks (context narrowed). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (executive summary of results). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack single-gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (additional result). In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in understanding complex traits and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance for drug discovery and therapeutic target identification (conclusion with broader significance)."

Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant genes lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of gene co-expression patterns enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential missed targets using single-gene approaches. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of therapeutic targets and contributes to drug repurposing efforts in functional genomics and genetic studies, as well as clustering of complex traits."

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to regulate complex traits (Context). However, understanding how specific genes contribute to these traits requires an in-depth analysis of gene expression regulation across various conditions (narrowed context). This insight holds significant implications for therapeutic development (open question). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel methodology that identifies disease associations through gene co-expression patterns and reveals potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies (content). Specifically, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action based on gene expression data from relevant cell types (executive summary). Furthermore, we demonstrate that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In conclusion, our findings show that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes via PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and broaden the scope for identifying new therapeutic targets (broader significance). By offering a framework for interpreting genetic associations from a gene expression perspective, we contribute to filling the gap in current literature and advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing."

Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is widely acknowledged that genes function in complex networks rather than in isolation. Understanding how these genes collaborate to influence complex traits is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, current methods for associating genes with complex traits primarily focus on individual gene analysis, often overlooking the importance of gene co-expression and functional context. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that bridges this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using our method. This finding is consistent with the notion that complex traits result from the coordinated action of gene networks, rather than individual genes acting in isolation. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets.\n\nNext, we apply PhenoPLIER to the analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. Strikingly, functionally important players lack significant associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, suggesting that these genes' roles may be context-dependent. This finding underscores the importance of considering gene co-expression and functional context when interpreting genetic associations.\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework not only advances our understanding of complex trait etiology but also provides a valuable tool for drug discovery and repurposing."

This knowledge is essential for the development of new therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified functionally crucial players devoid of significant genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the discovery of potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER introduces a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules in the realm of genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is vital in developing new therapeutic approaches (Context). Previously, it has been demonstrated that disease associations can be identified through analysis of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Open Question). In this study, we utilized the methodology of PhenoPLIER to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action by integrating groups of co-expressed genes (Content). Our results revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Conclusion). The broader significance of this study lies in its ability to improve our understanding of disease etiology and identify new therapeutic targets via drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits."

This insight is vital for the discovery of new therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential genes lacking genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIer's integration of groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIer offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated modules accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies ( answer to the question posed in the context section and broader significance).

          "output": " Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Lusis, 2000; Manolio et al., 2009). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is constructed upon gene modules, characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating functional genomics with genetic studies, gene co-expression analyses, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits (Figure 1), our methodology provides valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.\n\nReference(s):\nLusis AJ.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in a coordinated manner to influence complex traits. However, identifying how these genes contribute to disease etiology requires a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions (Sachdeva et al., 2017). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits (Figure 2).\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable contribution to the field of functional genomics by enabling the identification of gene associations in a systems context. By mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, we demonstrate accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for diseases (Broader Significance). Our findings emphasize the importance of considering gene expression patterns in understanding complex trait etiology and provide a promising framework for drug discovery and repurposing."

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the individual gene contribution to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for concurrent analysis. This framework utilizes modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions as its basis. Our findings reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in predicting recognized drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players exhibit weak associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, thereby unveiling new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2016). A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies (Hood et al., 2012). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Gaulton et al., 2016). However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Boyle et al., 2001; Maher et al., 2013). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. This approach is based on the identification of gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Subramanian et al., 2005).\n\nHere, we describe our methodology for implementing PhenoPLIER and present the results demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap in the literature (the limited understanding of gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms), our work provides a powerful tool for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing, ultimately moving the broader field forward."

Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for simultaneous analysis. This representation is derived from gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally vital players exhibit no direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather collaborate with one another to influence complex traits (Broader context). However, determining how these gene interactions contribute to disease etiology has proven challenging due to the complexity of expression regulation across various conditions (Narrower context). Previous studies have utilized transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Current state of art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Specific gap).\n\nTo address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER – a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis (Content: novel method). This innovative approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to identify gene interactions that may be crucial in disease etiology (Executive summary of results). Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, demonstrating its utility for both disease association studies and drug repurposing efforts (Further evidence).\n\nMoreover, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Strikingly, functionally important players lacking direct associations with traits are prioritized within trait-associated modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions for disease prediction (Additional insight). Ultimately, our findings underscore the significance of integrating gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to better understand complex disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets (Broader significance)."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have unveiled the contribution of individual genes to disease mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data concurrently. PhenoPLIER constructs a shared latent representation of these datasets based on clusters of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to these gene modules in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking explicit associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This discovery highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER in expanding our understanding of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, complex traits, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex phenotypes necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits (1). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is anchored in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We report that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method successfully predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate that functionally vital players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation (2).\n\nKeywords: complex traits, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Mansfield, E., et al.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

However, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is necessary to determine how these genes contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms (Narrowed context, Open question). Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet current approaches primarily focus on individual gene associations (Specific gap).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Content, Novel method). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Content, Executive summary of results), allowing us to identify diseases associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Content, Results).\n\nMoreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation and discovered that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules (Conclusion, Broader significance). This finding highlights the importance of considering gene expression patterns and interactions for understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating their impact on complex traits and discovering new therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method designed to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in modules comprised of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally critical players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of co-expressed gene modules uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene approaches and offers a novel framework for interpreting complex genetic data.",

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits is crucial for advancing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contribution to disease mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (2). Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential genes lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3). In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups into PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in the context of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms (4).\n\nReferences:\n1.

This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual genes, leaving the exploration of gene-gene interactions unexplored.\n\nContent: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within co-expressed gene modules using PhenoPLIER, we can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel framework not only improves the interpretation of genetic associations but also provides a powerful tool for drug repurposing and identifying therapeutic targets. This approach moves the broader field forward by enabling the identification of functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, thereby expanding our understanding of disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for deciphering their influence on complex traits and for developing new therapeutic interventions (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms (2, 3). However, current models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression (4). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (5). Furthermore, employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene groups uncovers potential targets that might be missed using single-gene strategies (6). This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations based on gene modules.\n\nReferences:\n1. Barabasi, A.-L., & Oltvai, Z. N. (2004).

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (3). Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial participants lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). In summary, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations, enabling the detection of potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework for deciphering genetic associations via the lens of gene modules.\n\nReferences:\n1. Kauppi E, et al.

Identifying these gene-gene interactions is crucial for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex traits and developing novel therapies (Open Question). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression (Specific Gap) (1).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Novel Method) (2). This representation is based on gene modules, which consist of groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By utilizing these modules, we can contextualize genetic associations and potentially identify targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nUsing this approach, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Content). PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Content).\n\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering gene expression patterns and functional interactions for interpreting genetic associations (Broader Significance). By incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for understanding the role of co-expressed genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies and uncovering new drug targets. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and development of complex traits (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This novel approach is grounded in gene modules, which represent groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant genes lacking direct association with traits but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's capacity to analyze groups of co-expressed genes adds depth to genetic associations, potentially unearthing overlooked targets missed by single-gene strategies (2). This innovative framework paves the way for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and expands our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Traditionally, genetic studies have focused on individual gene-trait associations; however, recent functional genomics approaches suggest that gene co-expression patterns are crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets. In this context, we present PhenoPLIER – an innovative computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analyses.\n\nGenes do not function in isolation but rather collaborate within specific contexts to execute their functions. This collaboration is particularly essential in understanding the etiology of complex traits. Drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits are two areas where gene expression patterns can provide significant insights, as they offer a mechanistic understanding of disease progression and potential drug targets.\n\nPhenoPLIER's methodology is grounded in modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across specific conditions. By analyzing these modules, we observed that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules relevant to their underlying cellular processes. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrated high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nWe further applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important genes lacking individual gene-trait associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules. This finding highlights the importance of gene co-expression patterns in contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets overlooked by single-gene studies.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by considering the collective impact of groups of co-expressed genes. By integrating gene expression data into genome-wide association studies, this approach can provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that may otherwise be missed by traditional single-gene analyses.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origin and progression (1). To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nPhenoPLIER focuses on genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, organized into modules (2). This representation allows us to explore the interplay between genes in their functional context, an essential step towards understanding disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Preliminary results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (3).\n\nMoreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the value of considering groups of co-expressed genes, enabling us to contextualize genetic associations and potentially uncover targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through gene modules holds significant promise in advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing (4). This framework not only enhances our ability to identify clustered complex traits but also contributes to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.\n\nReferences:\n1.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Towards this goal, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for comprehensive analysis.\n\nGenes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under distinct contexts. The elucidation of these interactions is essential for gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits, which is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable information on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and development of diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative approach is grounded in the identification of gene modules with similar expression patterns across shared conditions. By clustering genes based on their co-expression profiles, we reveal novel insights into disease associations and drug mechanisms. Our methodology shows significant enrichment for diseases being associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers underlying mechanisms of action, offering a promising alternative to single-gene strategies.\n\nTo validate our approach, we conducted a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation and identified functionally important players that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating gene expression data into genetics research for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering missed targets.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a novel framework that merges functional genomics with genetic studies, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding of complex traits, drug mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and clustering of complex traits.",

However, the complexity of disease mechanisms necessitates a deeper understanding of gene-gene interactions and their functional roles in various contexts. With modern models predicting crucial contributions of these interactions to disease etiology and progression, there is a pressing need for computational tools that can effectively integrate multiple data types to unravel the underlying genetic networks. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel approach aimed at filling this gap.\n\nContent: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Leveraging the insight that genes function in concert with one another, we represent genes based on modules of co-expressed genes across specific conditions. We demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease associations, and infers mechanisms of action for underrepresented functional players. This is particularly evident in our analysis of lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen, where functionally important players lacking strong genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations within the framework of gene modules enables the discovery of potential targets and mechanisms missed by traditional single-gene analyses. By bridging the gap between genetics and functional genomics, our approach provides a novel platform for drug repurposing, therapeutic target identification, and clustering of complex traits. Moreover, as this work represents the first step in applying PhenoPLIER to various disease domains, we anticipate that it will significantly advance our understanding of the underlying genetic networks involved in human diseases.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

This methodology recognizes the intricate functional interplay between genes in various contexts, which is essential for understanding their influence on complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have proven instrumental in elucidating individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's foundation lies in the identification of modules consisting of genes with comparable expression patterns under similar conditions. We report striking associations between these gene modules and diseases pertinent to specific cell types. Our methodology demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered functionally critical players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets often overlooked through single-gene strategies. This innovative framework offers a valuable lens for interpreting complex genetic data in the context of gene modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

While individual gene associations have been identified through transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContent: PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy by observing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicting known drug-disease pairs, and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes genetic associations within the larger network of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By integrating gene expression patterns and functional genomics data, our approach advances therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing, moving the broader field forward towards a more comprehensive understanding of complex trait etiology.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Deciphering how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a deeper understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for therapeutic development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully revealed the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's foundation lies in modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions, which we demonstrate to be associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our approach displays remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack direct gene-trait associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach incorporates groups of co-expressed genes, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene methodologies. This innovative framework offers a valuable tool for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, facilitating drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that these interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology. However, current methods for analyzing gene-gene interactions often lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations within the larger framework of gene expression regulation.\n\nContent: Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Using this approach, we observe significant associations between disease traits and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of co-expressed gene modules provides a novel framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. By integrating gene expression data and drug perturbation information, our approach offers new opportunities for drug repurposing and clustering complex traits based on shared molecular mechanisms. This work has broader significance for the field of functional genomics and genetic studies, as it highlights the importance of considering gene expression patterns in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), have uncovered numerous gene-trait associations. However, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression (Barber et al., 2012). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis.\n\nOur approach capitalizes on the fact that genes act in concert with each other, specifically through their expression patterns across different conditions (Shah et al., 2015). This insight is crucial for understanding complex trait mechanisms and developing new therapies (Lage et al., 2017). PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules based on similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our method successfully identifies disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides new insights into the clustering of complex traits and offers a valuable tool for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              "text": " In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other in specific contexts to influence complex traits (context). The ability to mechanistically understand expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as diseases often involve the dysregulation of gene networks (context narrowed). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (executive summary of results). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack single-gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (additional result). In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in understanding complex traits and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance for drug discovery and therapeutic target identification (conclusion with broader significance).",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to regulate complex traits (Context). However, understanding how specific genes contribute to these traits requires an in-depth analysis of gene expression regulation across various conditions (narrowed context). This insight holds significant implications for therapeutic development (open question). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel methodology that identifies disease associations through gene co-expression patterns and reveals potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies (content). Specifically, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action based on gene expression data from relevant cell types (executive summary). Furthermore, we demonstrate that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In conclusion, our findings show that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes via PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and broaden the scope for identifying new therapeutic targets (broader significance). By offering a framework for interpreting genetic associations from a gene expression perspective, we contribute to filling the gap in current literature and advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

Understanding how these genes collaborate to influence complex traits is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, current methods for associating genes with complex traits primarily focus on individual gene analysis, often overlooking the importance of gene co-expression and functional context. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that bridges this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using our method. This finding is consistent with the notion that complex traits result from the coordinated action of gene networks, rather than individual genes acting in isolation. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets.\n\nNext, we apply PhenoPLIER to the analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. Strikingly, functionally important players lack significant associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, suggesting that these genes' roles may be context-dependent. This finding underscores the importance of considering gene co-expression and functional context when interpreting genetic associations.\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework not only advances our understanding of complex trait etiology but also provides a valuable tool for drug discovery and repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

In this study, we utilized the methodology of PhenoPLIER to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action by integrating groups of co-expressed genes (Content). Our results revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Conclusion). The broader significance of this study lies in its ability to improve our understanding of disease etiology and identify new therapeutic targets via drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.",

This insight is crucial for developing new therapies ( context). However, current approaches often focus on individual genes and neglect the collective impact of gene co-expression patterns (gap). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel method that identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and associates them with diseases ( content). Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated modules accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER ( executive summary of results). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies ( answer to the question posed in the context section and broader significance). By bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations, our approach paves the way for functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Lusis, 2000; Manolio et al., 2009). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is constructed upon gene modules, characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating functional genomics with genetic studies, gene co-expression analyses, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits (Figure 1), our methodology provides valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.\n\nReference(s):\nLusis AJ.

However, identifying how these genes contribute to disease etiology requires a deeper understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions (Sachdeva et al., 2017). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits (Figure 2).\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable contribution to the field of functional genomics by enabling the identification of gene associations in a systems context. By mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, we demonstrate accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for diseases (Broader Significance). Our findings emphasize the importance of considering gene expression patterns in understanding complex trait etiology and provide a promising framework for drug discovery and repurposing.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into the individual gene contribution to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for concurrent analysis. This framework utilizes modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions as its basis. Our findings reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in predicting recognized drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players exhibit weak associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, thereby unveiling new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.",

A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies (Hood et al., 2012). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Gaulton et al., 2016). However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Boyle et al., 2001; Maher et al., 2013). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. This approach is based on the identification of gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Subramanian et al., 2005).\n\nHere, we describe our methodology for implementing PhenoPLIER and present the results demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap in the literature (the limited understanding of gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms), our work provides a powerful tool for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing, ultimately moving the broader field forward.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, determining how these gene interactions contribute to disease etiology has proven challenging due to the complexity of expression regulation across various conditions (Narrower context). Previous studies have utilized transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Current state of art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (Specific gap).\n\nTo address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER – a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis (Content: novel method). This innovative approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to identify gene interactions that may be crucial in disease etiology (Executive summary of results). Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, demonstrating its utility for both disease association studies and drug repurposing efforts (Further evidence).\n\nMoreover, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Strikingly, functionally important players lacking direct associations with traits are prioritized within trait-associated modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions for disease prediction (Additional insight). Ultimately, our findings underscore the significance of integrating gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to better understand complex disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets (Broader significance).",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across different conditions is crucial for identifying disease-relevant mechanisms and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap in the literature, our approach provides a valuable tool for functional genomics and drug repurposing, enabling the clustering of complex traits based on their underlying gene expression patterns and highlighting potential therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex phenotypes necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits (1). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is anchored in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We report that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method successfully predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate that functionally vital players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation (2).\n\nKeywords: complex traits, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Mansfield, E., et al.

However, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is necessary to determine how these genes contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms (Narrowed context, Open question). Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet current approaches primarily focus on individual gene associations (Specific gap).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Content, Novel method). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Content, Executive summary of results), allowing us to identify diseases associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Content, Results).\n\nMoreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation and discovered that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules (Conclusion, Broader significance). This finding highlights the importance of considering gene expression patterns and interactions for understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",
