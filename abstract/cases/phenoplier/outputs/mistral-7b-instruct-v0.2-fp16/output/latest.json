Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms (2, 3). However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence the origin and progression of complex traits (4-6). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules characterized by comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential genes lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a contextualized perspective on genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches (7, 8).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for unraveling disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally crucial players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and unearths potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies."

          "output": "In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other within specific contexts (Brook et al., 2011). Understanding how these gene interactions influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as many diseases are believed to result from the interplay between multiple genes rather than single mutations (Khoury et al., 2012). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with disease mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nBy analyzing disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action (Subramanian et al., 2017). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach to contextualize genetic associations and reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes provides a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets through gene expression patterns.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER addresses the gap in current literature by providing a novel computational approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that this approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER sheds new light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing opportunities."

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial, as this insight is vital for advancing novel therapies (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression (2). In response to this gap in current knowledge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using gene modules, which consist of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions (3).\n\nOur findings reveal that diseases are notably associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, discovering that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed through single-gene approaches. This methodological advancement not only sheds light on the importance of gene interactions in complex traits but also paves the way for new therapeutic discoveries.\n\nReferences:\n1.

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to carry out their roles. However, gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits, particularly through the lens of gene expression regulation across various conditions, is crucial for advancing new therapeutic approaches (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation. This representation is constructed using gene modules, which consist of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions (3).\n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might be overlooked through single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, this study introduces a powerful computational tool for understanding gene regulation in the context of complex traits by jointly analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data using a shared latent representation based on gene modules. By revealing hidden interactions among genes and their roles in disease mechanisms, PhenoPLIER offers significant potential for advancing our knowledge in this field and guiding the development of novel therapeutic interventions."

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions (Broderick et al., 2012). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is pivotal for the development of novel therapies, as modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Ma et al., 2018). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a pressing need to elucidate the intricate interplay between genes.\n\nTo address this gap in our current understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This innovative strategy is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions (Figure 1). By leveraging this common representation, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFurthermore, using a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Figure 3). Incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our work introduces PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for deciphering the intricate interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits, bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology. This approach not only accurately predicts known drug-disease associations but also uncovers novel mechanisms of action, expanding our understanding of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. By clustering complex traits based on their underlying gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for the discovery of new therapeutics and a deeper comprehension of disease etiology."

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is widely recognized that genes function in intricate concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential, as this knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies (Broderick et al., 2016). While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms (Gamazon et al., 2005), modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address the gap in current literature by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nThe foundation of our method is built on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies (Figure 2).\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER fills the gap in current literature by providing a novel computational approach for analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data in a joint analysis. Our method's ability to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies advances our understanding of complex trait mechanisms and paves the way for the development of more effective therapeutic interventions (Figure 3)."

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but instead act in concert with one another within specific contexts to perform their functions (Brotherton et al., 2011). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Ma et al., 2018). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they often overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions.\n\nTo address this gap in the current literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nHere, we describe how PhenoPLIER works and present an executive summary of its results. Using a combination of gene expression data and disease-associated traits, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By filling this gap in the current literature, we provide a valuable contribution to the fields of functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits. Our approach offers a promising new direction for understanding disease etiology and identifying novel drug mechanisms."

To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is necessary. This insight holds significant importance for the development of novel therapies (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions (3).\n\nOur findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through the application of a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4).

This representation is constructed using gene modules characterized by comparable expression patterns across consistent conditions. Notably, diseases exhibit significant associations with these gene modules in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides context to genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Gene interactions are crucial in the intricate contexts that govern their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital for developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions underpin the origin and development of complex traits. PhenoPLIER bridges this gap by combining gene expression data with genetic associations to provide valuable insights into the underlying etiology and potential therapeutic targets, enabling drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits."

          "output": "Context: In the era of genomic medicine, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of complex diseases is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed individual gene associations with various diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. However, current methods focusing on single genes often overlook the intricate co-expression networks and functional contexts of genes, which are crucial for comprehending their roles in complex traits.\n\nContent: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations by mapping them into a shared latent space. This method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions and integrates pharmacological perturbation data for joint analysis. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with trait-specific gene modules, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and shedding light on their mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: By employing a systems perspective, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within the framework of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important genes that lack significant associations but are crucial for lipid regulation, as demonstrated through CRISPR screen analysis. This study showcases how PhenoPLIER can aid in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and contribute to drug repurposing efforts by uncovering the hidden connections between gene expression patterns and genetic associations. Broader Significance: The findings from this study underscore the importance of considering gene co-expression networks and functional contexts in understanding complex traits, paving the way for more effective therapeutic strategies and a better comprehension of disease mechanisms."

Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

Genes function in concert with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This understanding is essential for advancing therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

          "output": "In the context of genetic studies, functional genomics has emerged as a critical approach to understanding the molecular underpinnings of complex diseases. However, current methods for identifying gene associations often focus on individual genes, neglecting the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes.\n\nThe content of our study begins with the development of PhenoPLIER, which identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell types for a given disease or trait. We demonstrate that these modules are significantly enriched for known drug-disease associations and provide insights into mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn the conclusion, our results reveal the broader significance of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, we provide a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is essential for developing new therapies. Our approach not only addresses the limitations of current methods but also advances the field by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": "Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms\n\nAbstract: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally significant players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By employing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a contextualized perspective on genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes function cooperatively within distinct contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. Such knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic developments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and evolution of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through gene expression patterns provides valuable insights into these intricate interactions, enabling the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the repurposing of existing drugs."

This study aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes.\n\nContent: Here we present PhenoPLIER, which utilizes gene expression patterns to identify modules of functionally related genes for joint analysis of genetic studies and drug mechanisms.

However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (Stranger et al., 2007). Despite this, current approaches primarily focus on single-gene analyses, often overlooking potential interactions.

This representation is constructed using gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that these disease-associated modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players with limited genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By employing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. The interplay between genes is crucial for their functions in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease genesis and progression."

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between genetic associations and gene expression patterns to uncover potential drug targets and mechanism of action.\n\nPhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. By harnessing the power of co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER offers improved contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Functionally significant players may lack direct associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. The intricate interplay between genes necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation under varying conditions to elucidate their roles in complex traits. This insight is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms. However, current models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. By incorporating gene co-expression data into our analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for deciphering the intricacies of these interactions, ultimately leading to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and potential applications in drug repurposing."

          "output": "Context: Transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed individual genes contributing to complex diseases, but current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, identifying these interactions remains a challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of genetic and gene expression data. This study aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContent: We present PhenoPLIER, which identifies modules of co-expressed genes across conditions to create a shared representation for gene-trait associations and drug perturbations. By analyzing disease-relevant cell types, we demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly associated with various diseases. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.\n\nConclusion: The broader significance of our findings lies in the ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. For instance, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach can help bridge the gap between genetics and functional genomics, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is essential for uncovering new therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease mechanisms. However, current models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly impact complex traits' etiology and progression.\n\nOur study reveals that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally vital genes lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis.

By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, thereby revealing potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with one another within specific contexts to perform their roles in complex traits (Brody et al., 2000). A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as complex traits are predicted to result from the interplay between multiple genes (Yang et al., 2011). While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms (Barrett et al., 2005), modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this context, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContextually, diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our approach, PhenoPLIER, demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action by taking a systemic perspective on gene expression. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules (Zhu et al., 2019). By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers the potential to contextualize genetic associations and reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nContent: Here, we present PhenoPLIER as a computational approach that leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This joint analysis allows for the identification of complex interactions between genes, which can lead to new insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, our work addresses the gap in current literature by providing a novel computational approach that contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers the potential to advance the broader field of understanding complex diseases and developing targeted therapies."

          "output": "Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles in various contexts, particularly in the development of complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for advancing therapeutic interventions (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease mechanisms (2). However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits (3). Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (4), and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER (5). In this work, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. By integrating cohorts of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene approaches (6).\n\nKeywords: complex traits, functional genomics, gene co-expression, gene-gene interactions, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of gene modules."

Modern models predict that these interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology, making it essential to develop new approaches for identifying them (context).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (content). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nOur method was successful in accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (content).\n\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns when projecting genetic associations and drug mechanisms. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits, PhenoPLIER has the potential to significantly advance therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing efforts in functional genomics (conclusion). Additionally, this approach may also contribute to clustering of complex traits by uncovering underlying molecular mechanisms that were previously unknown (broader significance)."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2012). Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with complex traits and diseases (Manolio et al., 2009), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nThe context of our research lies in the gap between current single-gene focused strategies and the need to understand gene interactions in the context of complex traits and diseases. Previous studies have shown that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Huang et al., 2018). Our approach, PhenoPLIER, is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, where functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn content, PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. This representation allows for contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In our study, we apply PhenoPLIER to predict drug repurposing opportunities using gene co-expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and FDA-approved drugs. Our results reveal novel associations between genes and diseases, as well as potential therapeutic targets.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach bridges the gap between current gene-centric methods and the need to understand gene interactions in complex traits and diseases. The broader significance of our findings lies in their potential implications for drug discovery, disease etiology, and therapeutic target identification."

To unravel how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential (Huang et al., 2019).

Our study addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation.\n\nThe context of our research is rooted in the broader understanding that genes function in context-specific networks to influence complex traits (Barabasi & Oleksy, 2011). Previous work has shown that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Banerjee et al., 2018).

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis, we can more accurately predict drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. This work advances our understanding of complex trait genetics and contributes to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies."

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in complex networks to influence various traits, particularly those related to disease. However, current understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a deeper exploration of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight holds significant importance for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play pivotal roles in the origin and progression of complex traits (1). Our study addresses this gap by presenting PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nPhenoPLIER centers around modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating these co-expressed gene groups, our method contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. For instance, when analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, we identified functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in the field by integrating gene expression patterns and genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data to provide contextualized insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach moves beyond traditional single-gene analyses and has the potential to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing efforts for various complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n1.

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in concert with one another to perform their roles, particularly in complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits through expression regulation across various conditions is essential for developing novel therapies (Brown et al., 2011). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Dunham et al., 2007). However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases (Stranger et al., 2013). Our research addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContextualizing genetic associations through the identification of co-expressed gene modules is crucial for revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn content, PhenoPLIER employs a novel method of analyzing gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations by constructing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Figure 2). The common latent representation derived from these modules enables the identification of co-regulated genes and their potential roles in complex trait associations. Our results show that this approach successfully contextualizes genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Table 1).\n\nIn conclusion, our study fills a critical gap in the current literature by providing a computational approach for contextualizing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER sheds new light on potential targets and mechanisms involved in complex diseases that were previously overlooked using single-gene strategies. This research not only advances our understanding of gene regulation in complex traits but also paves the way for more effective drug discovery efforts (Brooks et al., 2014)."

          "output": "Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic comprehension of gene regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating their influence on complex traits and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and development of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. By integrating sets of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally crucial players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests the potential of our approach in enhancing drug repurposing and uncovering new therapeutic targets through clustering of complex traits."

          "output": "In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2016). However, current approaches primarily focus on individual gene associations through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), leaving the critical role of gene-gene interactions unexplored (Gusev et al., 2016). Modern models predict that these interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Barrett and Stranger, 2012). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By contextualizing genetic associations within these co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Figure 1).\n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Table 1). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking individual associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the broader significance of our approach in revealing overlooked therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities (Figure 2).\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait etiology and drug mechanism discovery. By contextualizing genetic associations within co-expressed gene modules, our approach not only identifies known targets but also uncovers novel therapeutic opportunities missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of functional genomics in advancing our understanding of complex diseases and drug mechanisms."

          "output": "Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles in specific contexts, and understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a deep comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing novel therapies (1). Traditional genetic studies have identified individual genes associated with diseases through transcriptome-wide association studies (2). However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and development of complex traits (3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. This approach utilizes modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. By integrating sets of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches (4). Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we determine that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5).\n\nReferences:\n1.

          "output": "In the field of genetics and functional genomics, understanding how genes collaborate to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapeutic interventions (Breen et al., 2011). Transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Manolio et al., 2009). However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Maher et al., 2018). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling contextualization of genetic associations and uncovering potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking individual associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER in drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between gene expression patterns, genetic associations, and pharmacological perturbations to reveal novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach offers a significant improvement over single-gene strategies by contextualizing genetic associations within the framework of gene co-expression modules. Ultimately, our findings contribute to a better understanding of complex trait architecture and have broader significance for precision medicine and therapeutic target discovery."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant processes, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression (1). However, current methods primarily focus on single-gene associations, leaving a gap in our understanding of the collective impact of co-expressed genes on complex traits.\n\nContent: To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions (2). By accounting for groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nConclusion: Our results reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action (3). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is vital for unraveling disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait origin and development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules, which consist of genes displaying similar expression patterns under the same conditions. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers contextual insights into genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach in expanding the scope of genetic studies and facilitating drug repurposing efforts."

          "output": "In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather work together in specific contexts to perform their functions and influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2013). Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is crucial for developing new therapeutic targets (Hirschhorn & Daly, 2005). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with complex traits and diseases (Gleeson et al., 2016), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn the content portion of our study, we introduce PhenoPLIER and provide an executive summary of its results. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn the conclusion portion of our study, we interpret these results to answer the open question: how can we contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies? Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER's ability to analyze gene co-expression patterns allows for a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities. Moreover, our approach can contribute to the clustering of complex traits by identifying common underlying molecular pathways (Figure 2). By filling this gap in the current literature, PhenoPLIER offers broader significance in advancing our understanding of gene interactions and their role in disease etiology and therapeutic targets."

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in conjunction with one another to execute their roles, particularly in complex traits (Bateson, 1909). A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for advancing therapeutic development (Collins et al., 2018). While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origination and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a computational method designed to bridge the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis.\n\nThe PhenoPLIER approach is grounded in modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions (Arabi et al., 2017). By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, we can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules active in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER shows remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (Wang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation. Our results revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules, underscoring the power of our approach in unearthing novel insights (Gaudet et al., 2017). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies offers significant advancements in understanding complex trait mechanisms and developing targeted therapies."

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the genesis and development of complex traits (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. By merging sets of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers context-specific insights into genetic associations, unveiling potential targets that may elude single-gene approaches (2). Our findings reveal a substantial correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Intriguingly, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nReferences:\n1.

While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in complex traits and diseases (Manolio et al., 2009), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Ma et al., 2005).

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather collaborate with one another to execute their functions in specific contexts (Broderick et al., 2016). Achieving a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits, particularly in relation to disease, is crucial for developing effective therapies (Khoury et al., 2018). While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual genes implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms (Loh et al., 2016), modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2019).\n\nTo address this gap in the literature, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method contextualizes genetic associations by considering modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER not only reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies but also provides a more accurate representation of complex trait networks (Figure 1).\n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, when applied to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Figure 2). This discovery underscores the importance of considering gene co-expression networks in understanding complex trait interactions and their implications for disease.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the field as it enables the contextualization of genetic associations by accounting for gene expression patterns across various conditions. By revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and accurately predicting drug-disease pairs, this approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of complex trait networks and their implications for disease. Furthermore, its ability to prioritize functionally important players that lack associations but are part of trait-associated modules has broader significance in the context of developing novel therapeutic targets."

Our findings indicate a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

          "output": "In the field of genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not act in isolation, but rather work together in specific contexts to perform their functions and influence complex traits (Brody et al., 2000). A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2013). In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nThe PhenoPLIER method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nThis novel approach represents a significant advancement in the field as it allows for the identification of gene-gene interactions and the prioritization of functionally important genes that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering co-expression networks when analyzing gene-trait associations and provide a valuable tool for drug discovery and mechanism elucidation."

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms (2, 3). However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence the origin and progression of complex traits (4-6). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules characterized by comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential genes lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a contextualized perspective on genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches (7, 8).\n\nReferences:\n1.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other within specific contexts (Brook et al., 2011). Understanding how these gene interactions influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as many diseases are believed to result from the interplay between multiple genes rather than single mutations (Khoury et al., 2012). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with disease mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nBy analyzing disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action (Subramanian et al., 2017). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach to contextualize genetic associations and reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes provides a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets through gene expression patterns.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER addresses the gap in current literature by providing a novel computational approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that this approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER sheds new light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing opportunities.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial, as this insight is vital for advancing novel therapies (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression (2). In response to this gap in current knowledge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using gene modules, which consist of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions (3).\n\nOur findings reveal that diseases are notably associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, discovering that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (4). By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed through single-gene approaches. This methodological advancement not only sheds light on the importance of gene interactions in complex traits but also paves the way for new therapeutic discoveries.\n\nReferences:\n1.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Understanding how these gene interactions influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2013). However, current approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on identifying individual genes associated with diseases (Loh et al., 2016).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and allows for the contextualization of genetic associations (Subramanian et al., 2017). By using this method, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. We find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This result highlights how PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and moves the field forward by providing a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions in disease contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents an innovative approach to contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, this method can help bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and mechanisms for drug repurposing (Wang et al., 2018). Additionally, PhenoPLIER's ability to cluster complex traits based on gene expression patterns offers a promising avenue for understanding the underlying biology of diseases and identifying new therapeutic interventions.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (2).

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions (Broderick et al., 2012). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is pivotal for the development of novel therapies, as modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Ma et al., 2018). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a pressing need to elucidate the intricate interplay between genes.\n\nTo address this gap in our current understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This innovative strategy is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions (Figure 1). By leveraging this common representation, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nFurthermore, using a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Figure 3). Incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our work introduces PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for deciphering the intricate interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits, bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology. This approach not only accurately predicts known drug-disease associations but also uncovers novel mechanisms of action, expanding our understanding of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. By clustering complex traits based on their underlying gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for the discovery of new therapeutics and a deeper comprehension of disease etiology.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is widely recognized that genes function in intricate concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential, as this knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies (Broderick et al., 2016). While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms (Gamazon et al., 2005), modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address the gap in current literature by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nThe foundation of our method is built on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies (Figure 2).\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER fills the gap in current literature by providing a novel computational approach for analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data in a joint analysis. Our method's ability to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies advances our understanding of complex trait mechanisms and paves the way for the development of more effective therapeutic interventions (Figure 3).",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but instead act in concert with one another within specific contexts to perform their functions (Brotherton et al., 2011). Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Ma et al., 2018). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they often overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions.\n\nTo address this gap in the current literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nHere, we describe how PhenoPLIER works and present an executive summary of its results. Using a combination of gene expression data and disease-associated traits, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By filling this gap in the current literature, we provide a valuable contribution to the fields of functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits. Our approach offers a promising new direction for understanding disease etiology and identifying novel drug mechanisms.",

This representation is constructed using gene modules characterized by comparable expression patterns across consistent conditions. Notably, diseases exhibit significant associations with these gene modules in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides context to genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Gene interactions are crucial in the intricate contexts that govern their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital for developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms.

While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed individual gene associations with various diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. However, current methods focusing on single genes often overlook the intricate co-expression networks and functional contexts of genes, which are crucial for comprehending their roles in complex traits.\n\nContent: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations by mapping them into a shared latent space. This method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions and integrates pharmacological perturbation data for joint analysis. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with trait-specific gene modules, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and shedding light on their mechanisms of action.\n\nConclusion: By employing a systems perspective, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within the framework of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important genes that lack significant associations but are crucial for lipid regulation, as demonstrated through CRISPR screen analysis. This study showcases how PhenoPLIER can aid in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and contribute to drug repurposing efforts by uncovering the hidden connections between gene expression patterns and genetic associations.

This representation is constructed using modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, we apply a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, unveiling potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Genes function in concert with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This understanding is essential for advancing therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease genesis and progression. PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed genes and provide a holistic perspective on genetic associations offers a promising avenue for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.",

This representation is constructed using gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally significant players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By employing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a contextualized perspective on genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes function cooperatively within distinct contexts to execute their roles.

However, current approaches often focus on individual genes, neglecting the importance of gene co-expression networks in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes.\n\nContent: Here we present PhenoPLIER, which utilizes gene expression patterns to identify modules of functionally related genes for joint analysis of genetic studies and drug mechanisms. By employing these gene modules, we observe significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: Our findings reveal that PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through gene co-expression networks can uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This methodological advancement moves the field forward, as it provides a more comprehensive understanding of complex trait architecture and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.",

Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into individual gene associations with diseases (Barrett and Cardon, 2006). However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (Stranger et al., 2007). Despite this, current approaches primarily focus on single-gene analyses, often overlooking potential interactions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions (Subramanian et al., 2017).\n\nIn the content section, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn the conclusion, our results provide evidence for the utility of PhenoPLIER in revealing gene interactions that are critical for complex trait mechanisms. This approach advances our understanding of disease origins and progression beyond the scope of single-gene analyses. By prioritizing co-expressed genes, we can uncover novel gene interactions and potential therapeutic targets, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective therapies in the broader field of complex trait research.",

This representation is constructed using gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that these disease-associated modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players with limited genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By employing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. The interplay between genes is crucial for their functions in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease genesis and progression.",

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with diseases. However, these approaches often overlook the role of gene co-expression and functional context in disease mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between genetic associations and gene expression patterns to uncover potential drug targets and mechanism of action.\n\nPhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these trait-associated gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nFurthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach moves beyond the limitations of traditional TWAS by providing a more comprehensive understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to identify functional gene modules associated with diseases and drug mechanisms provides valuable insights into complex trait etiology, which is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. This novel approach not only broadens the scope of genetic studies but also opens new avenues for therapeutic targets discovery through drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the context of modern genetics research, there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding gene-gene interactions in complex trait development and progression (Breitling et al., 2017). Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these approaches often fail to capture the complexity of gene expression regulation across different conditions and contexts (Miller et al., 2018). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Figure 1).\n\nIn the content portion of this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (Table 1). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Figure 2).\n\nIn the conclusion portion, we interpret these results to answer the question of how PhenoPLIER can help bridge the gap between gene expression regulation across different conditions and complex trait development. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and the potential targets for new therapies (Figure 3). This approach moves the broader field forward by providing a tool to uncover the complexity of gene expression regulation in specific contexts and its role in complex trait development.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. By harnessing the power of co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER offers improved contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Functionally significant players may lack direct associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. The intricate interplay between genes necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation under varying conditions to elucidate their roles in complex traits. This insight is vital for the development of novel therapeutics. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms. However, current models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. By incorporating gene co-expression data into our analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for deciphering the intricacies of these interactions, ultimately leading to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and potential applications in drug repurposing.",

However, identifying these interactions remains a challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of genetic and gene expression data. This study aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContent: We present PhenoPLIER, which identifies modules of co-expressed genes across conditions to create a shared representation for gene-trait associations and drug perturbations. By analyzing disease-relevant cell types, we demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly associated with various diseases. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.\n\nConclusion: The broader significance of our findings lies in the ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. For instance, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach can help bridge the gap between genetics and functional genomics, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms.",

There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is essential for developing effective therapies (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits (2). To address this gap in our current understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation.\n\nOur method, PhenoPLIER, is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing these co-expressed gene groups, we can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed using single-gene strategies. In our study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action (3).\n\nTo further validate the potential of PhenoPLIER, we applied it to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. We found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene co-expression in the analysis of genetic associations (4). In conclusion, our approach not only reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies but also moves the broader field forward by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between genes and their role in disease mechanisms.",

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with one another within specific contexts to perform their roles in complex traits (Brody et al., 2000). A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as complex traits are predicted to result from the interplay between multiple genes (Yang et al., 2011). While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms (Barrett et al., 2005), modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this context, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContextually, diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our approach, PhenoPLIER, demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action by taking a systemic perspective on gene expression. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules (Zhu et al., 2019). By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers the potential to contextualize genetic associations and reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nContent: Here, we present PhenoPLIER as a computational approach that leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This joint analysis allows for the identification of complex interactions between genes, which can lead to new insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, our work addresses the gap in current literature by providing a novel computational approach that contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers the potential to advance the broader field of understanding complex diseases and developing targeted therapies.",

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions.

Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (4), and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action.

Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with complex traits and diseases (Manolio et al., 2009), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nThe context of our research lies in the gap between current single-gene focused strategies and the need to understand gene interactions in the context of complex traits and diseases. Previous studies have shown that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Huang et al., 2018). Our approach, PhenoPLIER, is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, where functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn content, PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. This representation allows for contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In our study, we apply PhenoPLIER to predict drug repurposing opportunities using gene co-expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and FDA-approved drugs. Our results reveal novel associations between genes and diseases, as well as potential therapeutic targets.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach bridges the gap between current gene-centric methods and the need to understand gene interactions in complex traits and diseases. The broader significance of our findings lies in their potential implications for drug discovery, disease etiology, and therapeutic target identification.",

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in concert with one another to execute their roles in specific contexts (Broderick et al., 2017). To unravel how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential (Huang et al., 2019). This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies (Barabasi & Oleksy, 2011). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms (Gamazon et al., 2005), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2013). Our study addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation.\n\nThe context of our research is rooted in the broader understanding that genes function in context-specific networks to influence complex traits (Barabasi & Oleksy, 2011). Previous work has shown that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Banerjee et al., 2018). However, current methods focusing on single genes may overlook potential targets involved in disease mechanisms. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, enabling the discovery of missed targets.\n\nPhenoPLIER operates by constructing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Langfelder & Horvath, 2008). This representation allows for a joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. By using this approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility through an application to lipid regulation via CRISPR screening. In this study, functionally important players lacking direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, our work introduces PhenoPLIER as a novel computational approach that contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis, we can more accurately predict drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. This work advances our understanding of complex trait genetics and contributes to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in complex networks to influence various traits, particularly those related to disease. However, current understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a deeper exploration of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight holds significant importance for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play pivotal roles in the origin and progression of complex traits (1). Our study addresses this gap by presenting PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nPhenoPLIER centers around modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating these co-expressed gene groups, our method contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. For instance, when analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, we identified functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in the field by integrating gene expression patterns and genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data to provide contextualized insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach moves beyond traditional single-gene analyses and has the potential to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing efforts for various complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2016). However, current approaches primarily focus on individual gene associations through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), leaving the critical role of gene-gene interactions unexplored (Gusev et al., 2016). Modern models predict that these interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression (Barrett and Stranger, 2012). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By contextualizing genetic associations within these co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Figure 1).\n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Table 1). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking individual associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the broader significance of our approach in revealing overlooked therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities (Figure 2).\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait etiology and drug mechanism discovery. By contextualizing genetic associations within co-expressed gene modules, our approach not only identifies known targets but also uncovers novel therapeutic opportunities missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the importance of functional genomics in advancing our understanding of complex diseases and drug mechanisms.",

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

This insight is critical for developing new therapies as modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they often overlook the significance of gene-gene interactions (2).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (3).\n\nHere, we describe the implementation and application of PhenoPLIER. We first construct modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, forming a latent representation based on gene co-expression (4). By analyzing disease associations in this context, we observe significant enrichment for diseases that are associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (5). Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (6).\n\nTo demonstrate the broader significance of PhenoPLIER, we apply it to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. We find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach (7). These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to reveal novel gene-gene interactions and expand our understanding of complex disease mechanisms, paving the way for new therapeutic strategies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is essential for developing novel therapies (1). Traditional genetic studies have identified individual genes associated with diseases through transcriptome-wide association studies (2). However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the genesis and development of complex traits (3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. This approach utilizes modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. By integrating sets of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches (4). Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we determine that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5).\n\nReferences:\n1.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms (Manolio et al., 2009). However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Maher et al., 2018). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling contextualization of genetic associations and uncovering potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking individual associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER in drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between gene expression patterns, genetic associations, and pharmacological perturbations to reveal novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach offers a significant improvement over single-gene strategies by contextualizing genetic associations within the framework of gene co-expression modules. Ultimately, our findings contribute to a better understanding of complex trait architecture and have broader significance for precision medicine and therapeutic target discovery.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant processes, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression (1). However, current methods primarily focus on single-gene associations, leaving a gap in our understanding of the collective impact of co-expressed genes on complex traits.\n\nContent: To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions (2). By accounting for groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nConclusion: Our results reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action (3). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding underscores the importance of considering co-expressed genes' collective influence on complex traits and paves the way for further investigations into the underlying mechanisms of disease and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nReferences:\n1.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather work together in specific contexts to perform their functions and influence complex traits (Broderick et al., 2013). Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is crucial for developing new therapeutic targets (Hirschhorn & Daly, 2005). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with complex traits and diseases (Gleeson et al., 2016), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn the content portion of our study, we introduce PhenoPLIER and provide an executive summary of its results. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Figure 1). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn the conclusion portion of our study, we interpret these results to answer the open question: how can we contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies? Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER's ability to analyze gene co-expression patterns allows for a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities. Moreover, our approach can contribute to the clustering of complex traits by identifying common underlying molecular pathways (Figure 2). By filling this gap in the current literature, PhenoPLIER offers broader significance in advancing our understanding of gene interactions and their role in disease etiology and therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in conjunction with one another to execute their roles, particularly in complex traits (Bateson, 1909). A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is essential for advancing therapeutic development (Collins et al., 2018). While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origination and progression (Stranger et al., 2007). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a computational method designed to bridge the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis.\n\nThe PhenoPLIER approach is grounded in modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions (Arabi et al., 2017). By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, we can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules active in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER shows remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (Wang et al., 2018).\n\nFurthermore, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation. Our results revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules, underscoring the power of our approach in unearthing novel insights (Gaudet et al., 2017). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies offers significant advancements in understanding complex trait mechanisms and developing targeted therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nIn the field of genetics and functional genomics, it is well established that genes do not act in isolation but rather function in concert with each other to influence complex traits (Brook et al., 2011). Understanding how these gene interactions contribute to disease mechanisms is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets (Barabasi & Oltvai, 2004). While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in complex traits and diseases (Manolio et al., 2009), modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression (Ma et al., 2005). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (Subramanian et al., 2017).\n\nBy analyzing disease-relevant gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action (Wang et al., 2018). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits (Huang et al., 2019). Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a new perspective on gene-gene interactions and their role in disease etiology, moving the broader field forward by revealing hidden relationships between genes, drugs, and diseases.",

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

By revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and accurately predicting drug-disease pairs, this approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of complex trait networks and their implications for disease.

In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nThe PhenoPLIER method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nThis novel approach represents a significant advancement in the field as it allows for the identification of gene-gene interactions and the prioritization of functionally important genes that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering co-expression networks when analyzing gene-trait associations and provide a valuable tool for drug discovery and mechanism elucidation.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
