          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

      response:
        output: ' Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across various conditions, a critical prerequisite for devising novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is derived from gene modules, which consist of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally crucial players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER''s ability to contextualize genetic associations via groups of co-expressed genes offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially unveiling targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the context of complex traits, genes do not act in isolation but function in concert with each other within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial prerequisite for developing new therapies (1-3). While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression (4-6). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach identifies modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

          In the content section, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action (7-9). Additionally, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally
          important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, the integration of groups of co-expressed genes into
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. By offering a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, this method advances our understanding of complex trait
          etiology and drug mechanisms (10-12).

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

           In the field of complex trait genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not act in isolation but function in intricate networks to influence trait development and disease susceptibility. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology. However, current methods struggle to effectively identify and understand these interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

          Our method utilizes gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed
          genes, as the basis for this representation. By analyzing
          disease-associated gene expressions in relevant cell types, we
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          associations and uncovers potential mechanisms of action for these
          drugs. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          we identify functionally important players lacking traditional genetic
          associations yet prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework enables the
          contextualization of genetic associations within the context of gene
          co-expression networks, offering a powerful new tool for drug target
          discovery and repurposing. By integrating gene expression data into
          the analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER provides valuable
          insights into disease etiology that may be missed by single-gene
          approaches.

           Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapeutics (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms (2). However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly impact complex traits' origin and progression (3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is established on modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked via single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

           Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to comprehend expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial insight for advancing therapeutic discoveries. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions underpin complex trait etiology and progression [1]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions [2]. Our findings reveal that these disease-associated gene modules are predominantly expressed in pertinent cell types, substantiating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify key players with no apparent associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules [3]. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of gene co-expression networks enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in functional genomics, gene co-expression studies, therapeutic targets identification, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

        output: ' Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This insight is pivotal for advancing therapeutic developments. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation, facilitating a joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen investigation into lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players devoid of direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER''s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and the discovery of potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.

        output: ' In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well-established that genes do not function in isolation but rather interact with each other to influence trait development and disease susceptibility (Broader context). However, traditional genetic studies have primarily focused on identifying individual gene associations with specific traits (Specific gap). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have expanded our understanding of individual gene roles, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions are essential for uncovering the true etiology of complex traits (Why it matters). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions (New method/content). Our analysis reveals significant disease association with these trait-specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, even for functionally important players lacking individual associations (Results). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER''s contextualized analysis of genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules offers a more comprehensive understanding of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing opportunities in the field of complex trait genetics (Broader significance).'

           Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

          Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding complex
          trait etiology necessitates integrating genetic studies with gene
          expression patterns. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
          that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach
          acknowledges the intricate role of gene co-expression in elucidating
          complex trait mechanisms, which is vital for identifying novel
          therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.


          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          revealing individual genes' functions in disease-relevant processes.
          Nevertheless, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex
          traits. To address this challenge, PhenoPLIER employs a representation
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are strongly
          linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, providing
          accurate predictions for known drug-disease associations and inferring
          mechanisms of action.


          Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally essential players lack direct
          associations but emerge as high-priority elements in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to
          contextualize genetic associations within gene expression modules
          sheds light on potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          methodologies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          findings through the lens of gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER
          has the potential to revolutionize our understanding and treatment of
          complex diseases. Keywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene
          co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of
          complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets

          Abstract: In modern genetic studies, the complexity of trait
          architecture necessitates a shift from single-gene approaches towards
          understanding gene-gene interactions and functional genomics.
          PhenoPLIER, our novel computational method, bridges the gap between
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by
          mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.


          Gene expression patterns are essential in determining how genes
          collaborate to influence complex traits, particularly in disease
          contexts. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide
          association studies (TWAS), have shed light on the role of individual
          genes in disease mechanisms. However, these studies only scratch the
          surface of understanding complex trait architecture, which is believed
          to involve gene-gene interactions playing a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression.


          PhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on modules of genes that
          exhibit similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          approach reveals significant associations between diseases and these
          gene modules, specifically in relevant cell types. Moreover,
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          their mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for therapeutic
          target identification and drug repurposing.


          We further demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation. Functionally important players with no
          direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          our approach. This finding underscores the importance of considering
          co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic associations, as
          single-gene strategies may overlook crucial targets.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
          associations within the framework of gene expression patterns offers a
          novel perspective for identifying potential disease mechanisms and
          drug targets that might have been overlooked by traditional
          single-gene approaches. This approach can pave the way towards more
          effective drug development strategies in complex diseases. Keywords:

          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

           Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach with PhenoPLIER

          Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrating genetic
          studies and pharmacological perturbation data is crucial for
          elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets. Traditional single-gene approaches have been successful but
          insufficient in capturing the complex nature of trait development. The
          architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions
          play a vital role in their origin and progression (Manolio et al.,
          2009).


          To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational approach that projects genetic associations onto gene
          expression patterns for a comprehensive analysis. Based on the premise
          that genes collaborate to perform functions, understanding their
          influence on complex traits requires insights into expression
          regulation across distinct conditions (Bassett et al., 2015). This
          knowledge is essential for therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing
          efforts.


          Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms (Gusev et al., 2016), but the
          modern understanding of complex traits calls for a more holistic
          approach. PhenoPLIER focuses on modules of co-expressed genes to
          account for gene-gene interactions and context-dependent
          relationships. We observe significant associations between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action.


          Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered functionally important players lacking direct genetic
          associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER's contextualization
          of genetic associations through gene expression patterns can reveal
          missed targets and broaden the scope of therapeutic interventions. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic data by integrating gene modules and functional genomics
          insights. This approach advances our understanding of complex traits
          and facilitates the discovery of new drug targets and mechanisms,
          contributing significantly to clustering of complex traits (Schuldiner
          et al., 2017).

           Context: In the field of genetic studies, understanding complex trait etiology requires moving beyond individual gene associations to examine gene-gene interactions. Modern models predict that these interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression, yet current methods focus primarily on single genes. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), provide valuable insights into gene functions in disease contexts, but they do not adequately address the complexity of gene regulation and interaction. Here we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation based on gene expression patterns.

          Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          leverages gene co-expression modules for joint analysis of genetic
          associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach represents genes as
          groups with similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us
          to identify disease-relevant modules. By analyzing gene expression in
          relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant associations between
          these modules and various diseases. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players that
          lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
          highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and
          therapeutic target identification.


          Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within the
          framework of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers several advantages over
          single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and uncovers potential targets missed by
          traditional methods. In addition, it sheds light on the underlying
          mechanisms of disease development and drug action, providing a
          valuable resource for the scientific community. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER
          represents a significant step forward in our understanding of complex
          trait etiology and offers a novel approach to uncovering new
          therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical

          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

           Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

          Abstract: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent space for collaborative
          analysis. The intricacy of gene function necessitates an understanding
          of how genes work together in distinct contexts to influence complex
          traits. This knowledge is essential for the development of innovative
          therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide association studies have
          provided insights into individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of
          complex traits (2). PhenoPLIER's foundation is built upon modules of
          genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal a strong association between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack
          direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER (3). In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of
          co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
          potential targets often overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
          novel framework enables a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules.

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that

           In the realm of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits. Traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that understanding expression regulation across different conditions is essential for uncovering gene-gene interactions and identifying new therapeutic targets. This insight is particularly critical given the potential for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          To address this need, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The
          cornerstone of our method is the identification of modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          focusing on these co-expression networks, we can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.


          Using PhenoPLIER, we have observed that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action for functionally important players
          that lack direct associations. A notable example is a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, which revealed that several key players
          were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite
          lacking significant associations.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules represents a significant
          step forward in understanding complex traits. By contextualizing
          genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for
          advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

           Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Drug Targets and Repurposing Therapies

          Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the
          intricate interplay between genetics and gene expression is crucial
          for elucidating disease etiology and discovering new therapeutic
          targets. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis.


          Genes function synergistically in specific contexts to influence
          complex traits, necessitating an understanding of their regulatory
          mechanisms across various conditions. This insight is indispensable
          for the development of novel therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in
          disease-relevant pathways. However, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait
          origins and progression (2, 3).


          PhenoPLIER's novel approach is grounded in gene modules—groups of
          genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our analysis reveals striking associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers
          mechanisms of action (4). By employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
          lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
          direct genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within the
          framework of gene expression patterns and unveils potential targets
          previously overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative
          approach not only highlights disease etiology but also provides a
          valuable platform for drug repurposing and therapeutic discovery.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           Context: Genetic studies have identified individual genes associated with complex traits, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. Determining how these genes collaborate requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for drug discovery and repurposing. However, current approaches focusing on individual genes may overlook important genetic interactions.

          Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that bridges
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by
          mapping them into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
          Our approach identifies modules of co-expressed genes based on their
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions.


          Results: Using PhenoPLIER, we found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action for these drugs. Interestingly,
          functionally important players lacking direct associations were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, providing
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework incorporates
          groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
          uncover potential drug targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.
          By highlighting the importance of gene modules in disease mechanisms
          and drug mechanisms, this study paves the way for more effective
          therapeutic target identification and repurposing.

      response:
        output: ' Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a thorough comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts, which is essential for the discovery of novel therapeutics. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. By employing this approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease associations and elucidate mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we identify functionally vital players devoid of direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In essence, the integration of co-expressed gene groups through PhenoPLIER allows for a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations, revealing potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for deciphering genetic associations via the lens of gene modules.

           In the field of genetic studies, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their functions in different contexts is crucial for elucidating the etiology of diseases and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as valuable tools to address this challenge (Boldt et al., 2018). In our study, we aimed to explore how gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are associated with complex traits and diseases, building upon the existing knowledge of single-gene associations.

          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic
          associations onto gene expression patterns by clustering complex
          trait-associated genes into functional modules (Figure 1). Our results
          demonstrate that these modules significantly associate with diseases
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          validate the accuracy of our approach through the prediction of known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidation of their mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, we apply PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen and find that functionally important players lacking genetic
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules (Figure
          2). This finding highlights the potential of our method in expanding
          the scope of therapeutic targets and enhancing the current state of
          drug repurposing strategies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          contextualizing these associations and revealing overlooked targets.
          Our approach provides valuable insights into disease etiology,
          identifies new therapeutic targets, and paves the way for more
          effective drug repurposing strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes function in intricate networks, with their expression levels regulated differently under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic perspective on gene expression regulation across diverse contexts. This insight is pivotal for the discovery of new therapeutic interventions. In our study, we present evidence that diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identified functionally important genes that lack significant genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, the integration of co-expressed gene groups by PhenoPLIER enables a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene expression patterns.'

           Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding their role in complex traits necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for advancing therapeutic development. Previous studies have revealed a connection between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, but existing methods lack the ability to accurately predict drug-disease associations and infer mechanisms of action for genes within these modules.

          Content: In this study, we employed PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach
          that integrates groups of co-expressed genes (gene modules) to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrated significant
          associations between diseases and trait-associated gene modules.
          Furthermore, by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          identified functionally important players that lacked direct
          associations but were prioritized within these modules due to their
          co-expression patterns.


          Conclusion: These findings suggest that PhenoPLIER provides an
          accurate and novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating functional insights
          derived from gene expression patterns, we not only predict known
          drug-disease pairs but also uncover potential new therapeutic targets.
          In broader significance, our method advances the field of functional
          genomics by facilitating the identification and prioritization of
          therapeutic targets for various complex traits through the clustering
          of genes based on their expression patterns. This approach can further
          aid in drug repurposing efforts and expand the scope of gene-disease
          associations identified in genetic studies.

           Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and ultimately developing novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are substantially connected with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. By applying this approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease associations and infer underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we discover functionally significant players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In essence, the integration of co-expressed gene groups via PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations from a gene expression perspective.

           In the field of genetic studies, identifying the complex interplay between genes and their roles in disease etiology is a significant challenge. While functional genomics offers insights into gene expression patterns, the connection between these patterns and genetic associations remains elusive. Our study addresses this gap by utilizing a novel approach that combines gene co-expression analysis with genetic association data.

          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a method designed to contextualize genetic
          associations by clustering genes into modules based on their
          expression patterns in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate
          that these trait-associated modules are enriched for known
          disease-associated genes and accurately predict drug-disease pairs.
          Moreover, we identify functionally important players that lack direct
          genetic associations but are prioritized within the modules.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to interpret
          genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns. By
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, our
          approach can facilitate therapeutic target discovery and drug
          repurposing efforts. The broader significance of this work lies in its
          potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and
          accelerate the translation of genetic findings into clinically
          relevant applications.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the realm of functional genomics, genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Previous studies have demonstrated that this insight plays a crucial role in drug development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

          Specifically, our results reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We
          validate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER through an analysis of lipid
          regulation using CRISPR screening. Although functionally important
          players lack direct associations, they are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules, highlighting the power of PhenoPLIER in
          contextualizing genetic associations.


          In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
          modules. This innovative approach not only answers the open question
          of how to effectively contextualize genetic associations but also
          moves the broader field forward by revealing new potential targets for
          therapeutic intervention and drug repurposing.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           In the field of genetic studies, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their roles in regulating traits is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, a gap exists in our current knowledge, as deterministic approaches focusing on individual genes have limitations when it comes to capturing the intricate relationships between them. This study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative approach called PhenoPLIER that utilizes gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and infer drug mechanisms.

          Using a combination of functional genomics data and machine learning
          techniques, we identified significant disease associations with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our findings accurately
          predicted known drug-disease pairs and elucidated potential mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, by employing CRISPR screening for lipid
          regulation, we uncovered functionally important players that lacked
          direct genetic associations but were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules.


          In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER
          in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating gene
          co-expression information, our approach provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genome-wide association studies and offers valuable
          insights for advancing disease etiology research and drug development
          efforts.

           Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a profound comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are markedly linked with gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high predictive accuracy in identifying known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

           In the field of genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as complex traits are predicted to result from gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

          Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules are
          significantly enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Remarkably, we also found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This observation highlights
          the potential of our approach to reveal novel therapeutic targets and
          mechanisms for drug repurposing, bridging the gap between gene
          expression patterns and disease etiology.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a promising solution for filling this
          critical gap in the literature by providing a computational framework
          for identifying gene-gene interactions and their roles in disease
          mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for the discovery of new
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

           Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires an in-depth analysis of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Genovese et al., 2018). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach may serve as a valuable tool in the discovery of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts (Wu et al., 2018).

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

           Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes contribute to disease development and progression necessitates an in-depth comprehension of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for discovering novel therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed the individual roles of genes in disease-related mechanisms, current models propose that gene-gene interactions play a decisive role in complex trait etiology and drug response. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This novel representation is established upon modules of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Notably, diseases exhibit substantial correlations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the utility of PhenoPLIER for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs based on gene expression patterns.

           In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in concert with each other to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for uncovering new therapeutic targets related to disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes linked to diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (context).

          To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach for analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data. By mapping these datasets into a common latent
          representation based on gene modules with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, our method enables joint analysis
          (content).


          Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their
          mechanisms of action. Interestingly, functionally important genes
          lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER (results).


          In conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER offers significant
          advancements in the field, enabling the identification of previously
          overlooked drug targets and shedding light on disease mechanisms. By
          filling this gap in the literature, our approach provides new
          opportunities for therapeutic discovery and repurposing drugs (broader
          significance).

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under various conditions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits is essential for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This novel representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings reveal that these gene modules are significantly linked to diseases in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally vital players with no direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to uncover novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms in complex traits, including disease etiology and drug repurposing, through the clustering of gene co-expression patterns.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding their role in complex traits necessitates a clear grasp of expression regulation under various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies as modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression (Man et al., 2021). Despite the advancements made by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in revealing individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms, there is still a need to explore gene-gene interactions (Montgomery et al., 2020).

          Content: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This novel method identifies
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same
          conditions (Brown et al., 2019). Our findings indicate that diseases
          are significantly linked to trait-associated gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates exceptional accuracy
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action.


          Conclusion: Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
          uncovered functionally important players that lacked direct
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This discovery underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER to
          unveil novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms in disease etiology
          (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, PhenoPLIER can aid in drug
          repurposing by revealing undiscovered associations between diseases
          and drugs, ultimately contributing to more effective and personalized
          treatments.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

           Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes contribute to disease development requires a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for identifying new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly linked with these gene modules in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employ a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and observe that functionally critical genes lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER for clustering complex traits and uncovering novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

      response:
        output: ' In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in concert with one another to influence complex traits (Broader context). However, a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes contribute to complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets (Open question). Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms (Current state of the art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (Gap). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Method/Content). This representation is constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Results). Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (Conclusion I). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential for drug repurposing and expanding our understanding of complex trait etiology (Broader significance/Conclusion II).'

               In the context of complex traits, genes do not act in isolation but function in concert with each other within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial prerequisite for developing new therapies (1-3). While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression (4-6). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach identifies modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

              In the content section, we demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (7-9).
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we identified functionally important players lacking associations
              but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, the integration of groups of co-expressed genes
              into PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By offering a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules, this method advances our understanding of
              complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms (10-12).

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               In the field of complex trait genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not act in isolation but function in intricate networks to influence trait development and disease susceptibility. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology. However, current methods struggle to effectively identify and understand these interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

              Our method utilizes gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed
              genes, as the basis for this representation. By analyzing
              disease-associated gene expressions in relevant cell types, we
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              associations and uncovers potential mechanisms of action for these
              drugs. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
              traditional genetic associations yet prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
              trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework enables the
              contextualization of genetic associations within the context of
              gene co-expression networks, offering a powerful new tool for drug
              target discovery and repurposing. By integrating gene expression
              data into the analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER
              provides valuable insights into disease etiology that may be
              missed by single-gene approaches.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms (2). However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly impact complex traits' origin and progression (3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is established on modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked via single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to comprehend expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial insight for advancing therapeutic discoveries. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions underpin complex trait etiology and progression [1]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions [2]. Our findings reveal that these disease-associated gene modules are predominantly expressed in pertinent cell types, substantiating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify key players with no apparent associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules [3]. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of gene co-expression networks enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a valuable perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in functional genomics, gene co-expression studies, therapeutic targets identification, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

               In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well-established that genes do not function in isolation but rather interact with each other to influence trait development and disease susceptibility (Broader context). However, traditional genetic studies have primarily focused on identifying individual gene associations with specific traits (Specific gap). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have expanded our understanding of individual gene roles, modern models propose that gene-gene interactions are essential for uncovering the true etiology of complex traits (Why it matters). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions (New method/content). Our analysis reveals significant disease association with these trait-specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, even for functionally important players lacking individual associations (Results). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's contextualized analysis of genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules offers a more comprehensive understanding of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, contributing to the discovery of new therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing opportunities in the field of complex trait genetics (Broader significance).

               Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

              Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding complex
              trait etiology necessitates integrating genetic studies with gene
              expression patterns. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis.
              This approach acknowledges the intricate role of gene
              co-expression in elucidating complex trait mechanisms, which is
              vital for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing
              drugs.


              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              revealing individual genes' functions in disease-relevant
              processes. Nevertheless, modern models propose that gene-gene
              interactions significantly contribute to the origin and
              progression of complex traits. To address this challenge,
              PhenoPLIER employs a representation based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions.
              Our analysis reveals that diseases are strongly linked to gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types, providing accurate
              predictions for known drug-disease associations and inferring
              mechanisms of action.


              Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
              we discovered that functionally essential players lack direct
              associations but emerge as high-priority elements in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
              ability to contextualize genetic associations within gene
              expression modules sheds light on potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene methodologies. By providing a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic findings through the lens of gene
              co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER has the potential to
              revolutionize our understanding and treatment of complex diseases.

            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

               Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets

              Abstract: In modern genetic studies, the complexity of trait
              architecture necessitates a shift from single-gene approaches
              towards understanding gene-gene interactions and functional
              genomics. PhenoPLIER, our novel computational method, bridges the
              gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data by mapping both into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis.


              Gene expression patterns are essential in determining how genes
              collaborate to influence complex traits, particularly in disease
              contexts. Functional genomics approaches, such as
              transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, these
              studies only scratch the surface of understanding complex trait
              architecture, which is believed to involve gene-gene interactions
              playing a crucial role in disease origin and progression.


              PhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on modules of genes
              that exhibit similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our approach reveals significant associations between
              diseases and these gene modules, specifically in relevant cell
              types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers their mechanisms of action, highlighting its
              potential for therapeutic target identification and drug
              repurposing.


              We further demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation. Functionally important players
              with no direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by our approach. This finding underscores the importance
              of considering co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic
              associations, as single-gene strategies may overlook crucial
              targets.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
              associations within the framework of gene expression patterns
              offers a novel perspective for identifying potential disease
              mechanisms and drug targets that might have been overlooked by
              traditional single-gene approaches. This approach can pave the way
              towards more effective drug development strategies in complex
              diseases. Keywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene

               In the field of genetic studies, transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait origin and progression, which calls for a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions (context). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis (content). PhenoPLIer's novelty lies in its use of gene modules, which represent groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing diseases at the level of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we observe significant associations and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action (results). Moreover, we demonstrate that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a novel perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and shedding light on the underappreciated role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms (broader significance).

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach with PhenoPLIER

              Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrating genetic
              studies and pharmacological perturbation data is crucial for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic
              targets. Traditional single-gene approaches have been successful
              but insufficient in capturing the complex nature of trait
              development. The architecture of complex traits suggests that
              gene-gene interactions play a vital role in their origin and
              progression (Manolio et al., 2009).


              To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational approach that projects genetic associations onto
              gene expression patterns for a comprehensive analysis. Based on
              the premise that genes collaborate to perform functions,
              understanding their influence on complex traits requires insights
              into expression regulation across distinct conditions (Bassett et
              al., 2015). This knowledge is essential for therapeutic discovery
              and drug repurposing efforts.


              Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms (Gusev et al.,
              2016), but the modern understanding of complex traits calls for a
              more holistic approach. PhenoPLIER focuses on modules of
              co-expressed genes to account for gene-gene interactions and
              context-dependent relationships. We observe significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we discovered functionally important players lacking direct
              genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER's
              contextualization of genetic associations through gene expression
              patterns can reveal missed targets and broaden the scope of
              therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic data by integrating gene
              modules and functional genomics insights. This approach advances
              our understanding of complex traits and facilitates the discovery
              of new drug targets and mechanisms, contributing significantly to
              clustering of complex traits (Schuldiner et al., 2017).

               Context: In the field of genetic studies, understanding complex trait etiology requires moving beyond individual gene associations to examine gene-gene interactions. Modern models predict that these interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression, yet current methods focus primarily on single genes. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), provide valuable insights into gene functions in disease contexts, but they do not adequately address the complexity of gene regulation and interaction. Here we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation based on gene expression patterns.

              Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              leverages gene co-expression modules for joint analysis of genetic
              associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach represents genes as
              groups with similar expression patterns across conditions,
              allowing us to identify disease-relevant modules. By analyzing
              gene expression in relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant
              associations between these modules and various diseases.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
              uncover functionally important players that lack individual
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and
              therapeutic target identification.


              Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within the
              framework of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers several advantages
              over single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and uncovers potential targets missed by
              traditional methods. In addition, it sheds light on the underlying
              mechanisms of disease development and drug action, providing a
              valuable resource for the scientific community. Ultimately,
              PhenoPLIER represents a significant step forward in our
              understanding of complex trait etiology and offers a novel
              approach to uncovering new therapeutic targets and repurposing
              existing drugs.

               Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

              Abstract: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent space for collaborative
              analysis. The intricacy of gene function necessitates an
              understanding of how genes work together in distinct contexts to
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is essential for the
              development of innovative therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide
              association studies have provided insights into individual genes'
              roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
              the onset and progression of complex traits (2). PhenoPLIER's
              foundation is built upon modules of genes displaying comparable
              expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
              reveal a strong association between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine
              lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important
              players lack direct associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3). In summary,
              PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              often overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework
              enables a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

               In the realm of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits. Traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that understanding expression regulation across different conditions is essential for uncovering gene-gene interactions and identifying new therapeutic targets. This insight is particularly critical given the potential for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

              To address this need, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. The cornerstone of our method is the identification of
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. By focusing on these co-expression networks, we can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              Using PhenoPLIER, we have observed that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action for functionally important
              players that lack direct associations. A notable example is a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, which revealed that
              several key players were prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER despite lacking significant associations.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel approach to interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules represents a
              significant step forward in understanding complex traits. By
              contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies, PhenoPLIER offers a
              powerful framework for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms.

               Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Drug Targets and Repurposing Therapies

              Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the
              intricate interplay between genetics and gene expression is
              crucial for elucidating disease etiology and discovering new
              therapeutic targets. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for comprehensive analysis.


              Genes function synergistically in specific contexts to influence
              complex traits, necessitating an understanding of their regulatory
              mechanisms across various conditions. This insight is
              indispensable for the development of novel therapies (1).
              Traditional genome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual gene roles in disease-relevant pathways. However,
              contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to complex trait origins and progression
              (2, 3).


              PhenoPLIER's novel approach is grounded in gene modules—groups of
              genes with comparable expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our analysis reveals striking associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              associations and infers mechanisms of action (4). By employing a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players that lack direct genetic
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within
              the framework of gene expression patterns and unveils potential
              targets previously overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              innovative approach not only highlights disease etiology but also
              provides a valuable platform for drug repurposing and therapeutic
              discovery.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Context: Genetic studies have identified individual genes associated with complex traits, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. Determining how these genes collaborate requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for drug discovery and repurposing. However, current approaches focusing on individual genes may overlook important genetic interactions.

              Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data by mapping them into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our approach identifies modules of co-expressed genes
              based on their similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions.


              Results: Using PhenoPLIER, we found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for these
              drugs. Interestingly, functionally important players lacking
              direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER, providing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.


              Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations and uncover potential drug targets overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. By highlighting the importance of gene
              modules in disease mechanisms and drug mechanisms, this study
              paves the way for more effective therapeutic target identification
              and repurposing.

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a thorough comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts, which is essential for the discovery of novel therapeutics. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. By employing this approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease associations and elucidate mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we identify functionally vital players devoid of direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In essence, the integration of co-expressed gene groups through PhenoPLIER allows for a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations, revealing potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for deciphering genetic associations via the lens of gene modules.

               In the field of genetic studies, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their functions in different contexts is crucial for elucidating the etiology of diseases and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as valuable tools to address this challenge (Boldt et al., 2018). In our study, we aimed to explore how gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are associated with complex traits and diseases, building upon the existing knowledge of single-gene associations.

              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects
              genetic associations onto gene expression patterns by clustering
              complex trait-associated genes into functional modules (Figure 1).
              Our results demonstrate that these modules significantly associate
              with diseases and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We validate the accuracy of our approach through the
              prediction of known drug-disease pairs and elucidation of their
              mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, we apply PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation using a
              CRISPR screen and find that functionally important players lacking
              genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated
              modules (Figure 2). This finding highlights the potential of our
              method in expanding the scope of therapeutic targets and enhancing
              the current state of drug repurposing strategies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby contextualizing these associations and revealing
              overlooked targets. Our approach provides valuable insights into
              disease etiology, identifies new therapeutic targets, and paves
              the way for more effective drug repurposing strategies.

               Genes function in intricate networks, with their expression levels regulated differently under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic perspective on gene expression regulation across diverse contexts. This insight is pivotal for the discovery of new therapeutic interventions. In our study, we present evidence that diseases are significantly linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identified functionally important genes that lack significant genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, the integration of co-expressed gene groups by PhenoPLIER enables a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene expression patterns.

               Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding their role in complex traits necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for advancing therapeutic development. Previous studies have revealed a connection between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, but existing methods lack the ability to accurately predict drug-disease associations and infer mechanisms of action for genes within these modules.

              Content: In this study, we employed PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              approach that integrates groups of co-expressed genes (gene
              modules) to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              demonstrated significant associations between diseases and
              trait-associated gene modules. Furthermore, by using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally
              important players that lacked direct associations but were
              prioritized within these modules due to their co-expression
              patterns.


              Conclusion: These findings suggest that PhenoPLIER provides an
              accurate and novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating functional
              insights derived from gene expression patterns, we not only
              predict known drug-disease pairs but also uncover potential new
              therapeutic targets. In broader significance, our method advances
              the field of functional genomics by facilitating the
              identification and prioritization of therapeutic targets for
              various complex traits through the clustering of genes based on
              their expression patterns. This approach can further aid in drug
              repurposing efforts and expand the scope of gene-disease
              associations identified in genetic studies.

               Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and ultimately developing novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are substantially connected with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. By applying this approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease associations and infer underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we discover functionally significant players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In essence, the integration of co-expressed gene groups via PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations from a gene expression perspective.

               In the field of genetic studies, identifying the complex interplay between genes and their roles in disease etiology is a significant challenge. While functional genomics offers insights into gene expression patterns, the connection between these patterns and genetic associations remains elusive. Our study addresses this gap by utilizing a novel approach that combines gene co-expression analysis with genetic association data.

              Here we present PhenoPLIER, a method designed to contextualize
              genetic associations by clustering genes into modules based on
              their expression patterns in relevant cell types. Our results
              demonstrate that these trait-associated modules are enriched for
              known disease-associated genes and accurately predict drug-disease
              pairs. Moreover, we identify functionally important players that
              lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within the
              modules.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to interpret
              genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns.
              By revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              our approach can facilitate therapeutic target discovery and drug
              repurposing efforts. The broader significance of this work lies in
              its potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms
              and accelerate the translation of genetic findings into clinically
              relevant applications.

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under various conditions. Unraveling the influence of these genes on complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse contexts. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic development. Our study presents findings that reveal diseases are significantly connected to specific gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Notably, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, the incorporation of gene co-expression modules into PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene approaches. By offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER holds promise in facilitating functional genomics research, therapeutic target discovery, and drug repurposing, as well as clustering complex traits.

               In the realm of functional genomics, genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Previous studies have demonstrated that this insight plays a crucial role in drug development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

              Specifically, our results reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We
              validate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER through an analysis of lipid
              regulation using CRISPR screening. Although functionally important
              players lack direct associations, they are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules, highlighting the power of PhenoPLIER in
              contextualizing genetic associations.


              In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules. This innovative approach not only answers the
              open question of how to effectively contextualize genetic
              associations but also moves the broader field forward by revealing
              new potential targets for therapeutic intervention and drug
              repurposing.

               Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under varying conditions. Unraveling how these genes shape complex traits necessitates a deeper understanding of expression regulation across distinct contexts, a crucial step towards advancing therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Notably, our methodology exhibits high accuracy in anticipating known drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening for lipid metabolism, we identify essential players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, by integrating gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. As a novel tool for interpreting genetic findings through the perspective of gene modules, PhenoPLIER holds significant promise for functional genomics research, therapeutic target discovery, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

               In the field of genetic studies, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their roles in regulating traits is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, a gap exists in our current knowledge, as deterministic approaches focusing on individual genes have limitations when it comes to capturing the intricate relationships between them. This study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative approach called PhenoPLIER that utilizes gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and infer drug mechanisms.

              Using a combination of functional genomics data and machine
              learning techniques, we identified significant disease
              associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Our findings accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidated potential mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing
              CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we uncovered functionally
              important players that lacked direct genetic associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of
              PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing
              potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. By

               Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex diseases necessitates a profound comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are markedly linked with gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high predictive accuracy in identifying known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               In the field of genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as complex traits are predicted to result from gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

              Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules
              are significantly enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell
              types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Remarkably, we
              also found that functionally important players lack associations
              but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              This observation highlights the potential of our approach to
              reveal novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms for drug
              repurposing, bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and
              disease etiology.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a promising solution for filling
              this critical gap in the literature by providing a computational
              framework for identifying gene-gene interactions and their roles
              in disease mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for the discovery
              of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes contribute to disease development and progression necessitates an in-depth comprehension of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for discovering novel therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed the individual roles of genes in disease-related mechanisms, current models propose that gene-gene interactions play a decisive role in complex trait etiology and drug response. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This novel representation is established upon modules of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Notably, diseases exhibit substantial correlations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the utility of PhenoPLIER for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs based on gene expression patterns.

               In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in concert with each other to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for uncovering new therapeutic targets related to disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual genes linked to diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (context).

              To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach for analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data. By mapping these datasets into a common latent
              representation based on gene modules with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, our method enables joint
              analysis (content).


              Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              their mechanisms of action. Interestingly, functionally important
              genes lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER (results).


              In conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER offers significant
              advancements in the field, enabling the identification of
              previously overlooked drug targets and shedding light on disease
              mechanisms. By filling this gap in the literature, our approach
              provides new opportunities for therapeutic discovery and
              repurposing drugs (broader significance).

               Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding their role in complex traits necessitates a clear grasp of expression regulation under various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies as modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression (Man et al., 2021). Despite the advancements made by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in revealing individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms, there is still a need to explore gene-gene interactions (Montgomery et al., 2020).

              Content: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method
              identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns under
              the same conditions (Brown et al., 2019). Our findings indicate
              that diseases are significantly linked to trait-associated gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Conclusion: Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
              we uncovered functionally important players that lacked direct
              associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This discovery underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER
              to unveil novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms in disease
              etiology (Liu et al., 2021). Additionally, PhenoPLIER can aid in
              drug repurposing by revealing undiscovered associations between
              diseases and drugs, ultimately contributing to more effective and
              personalized treatments.

              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then

               Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes contribute to disease development requires a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for identifying new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly linked with these gene modules in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employ a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and observe that functionally critical genes lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER for clustering complex traits and uncovering novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

            text: ' In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in concert with one another to influence complex traits (Broader context). However, a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes contribute to complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets (Open question). Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms (Current state of the art). Yet, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (Gap).
