          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry out
          their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
          etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover
          that functionally important players lack individual genetic
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a critical challenge. This
          knowledge is not only essential for gaining mechanistic insights into
          expression regulation across different conditions but also plays a
          pivotal role in developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in
          understanding the impact of gene-gene interactions on complex trait
          architecture and disease progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, enabling accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and
          inference of mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This work underscores the broader significance of functional genomics
          in uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for
          more effective drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to carry out
          their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation under various conditions, which is crucial for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          substantial associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack genetic associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a critical challenge. This
          is particularly important in the development of new therapies, as
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, there remains a gap in understanding
          how these genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly

          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This approach not only advances our
          understanding of disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          The study of complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding
          of gene expression regulation across various conditions, as genes
          often work in concert to fulfill their functions. This knowledge is
          not only crucial for academic purposes but also has significant
          implications for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and

          analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important

          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex
          traits and contributing to the development of novel therapeutic

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to carry out
          their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across various conditions, which is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
          complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this paper, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the
          same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players may lack
          direct genetic associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease etiology and progression. However, current methods lack the
          ability to effectively analyze these interactions. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players were
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER despite lacking individual associations. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This work highlights the importance of
          considering gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, providing a framework for future functional genomics
          studies and drug repurposing efforts.

          The study of complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of
          gene expression regulation across various conditions, as genes work in
          concert with each other to carry out their functions. This knowledge
          is not only crucial for basic research but also plays a significant
          role in the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the individual roles of genes
          in disease mechanisms; however, they often overlook the importance of
          gene-gene interactions, which are predicted to be critical in disease
          origin and progression by modern models of complex trait architecture.
          In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

          screen, we discovered that functionally important players may lack
          individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          our approach can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby
          advancing the broader field of complex trait research and therapeutic
          development.

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry
          out their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to
          complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
          expression regulation under various conditions, which is crucial for
          the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          influence disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          important players may lack associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          The study of complex traits necessitates an understanding of the
          concerted actions of genes in specific contexts, particularly their
          expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide association
          studies have demonstrated by uncovering individual gene roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and
          progression of diseases, yet this aspect remains largely unexplored.
          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results show significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate prediction
          of known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          found that functionally important players lacked individual genetic
          associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
          approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby moving the
          broader field forward in understanding disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to
          fulfill their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
          traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and unveil
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease etiology and progression. This highlights a gap in our current
          understanding - the need to explore these interactions systematically.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to
          fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across different conditions. Through our analysis,
          we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene

          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene

          not only advances our understanding of disease etiology but also opens
          up new avenues for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex
          traits.

          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other
          in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework designed to
          integrate genetic association studies with pharmacological
          perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on gene modules
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs while also inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, by utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          we find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes operate in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions, which has been shown to be crucial for developing new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology
          and progression.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how genes interact with each other to influence complex traits is
          crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology. However,
          current methodologies often overlook these interactions, focusing
          instead on single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          understanding of disease etiology but also opens up new avenues for
          drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under the same conditions. We observe significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players may lack
          direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes work together in specific
          contexts to carry out their functions; understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease etiology and progression.

          In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how groups of co-expressed genes influence complex traits is a
          significant challenge. This knowledge gap is particularly relevant as
          it hinders our ability to develop new therapies, given that genes
          often act in concert with each other to perform their functions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology

          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This not only advances our

          The field of genetics has made significant strides in understanding
          the role of individual genes in various complex traits and diseases
          through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, there remains

          This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar

          overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate in harmony with
          each other in specific contexts to execute their functions.
          Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various
          conditions, which has been shown to be pivotal for the development of
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
          complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role
          in disease etiology and progression.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes interact
          with each other to influence complex traits is pivotal for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease etiology and progression. However, current methods often
          overlook these crucial interactions. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players
          lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This approach moves the broader
          field forward by providing a more comprehensive understanding of gene
          interactions in complex traits and offering new insights into disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the pursuit of understanding complex traits and their underlying
          genetic associations, current transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms.
          However, there remains a significant gap in our knowledge regarding
          gene-gene interactions and their collective influence on these traits.
          This is particularly important as modern models predict that such
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To
          bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions to create this representation. Through our
          research, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
          demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Interestingly, when applied to a
          CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This work underscores the importance of considering gene
          interactions when determining how genes influence complex traits,
          providing a mechanistic understanding that is critical for developing
          new therapies.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how groups of co-expressed genes influence complex traits is pivotal
          for elucidating disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they often overlook
          the intricate network of gene-gene interactions that are crucial to
          the origin and progression of complex traits. To bridge this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while
          inferring their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          Consequently, our approach not only advances the understanding of
          complex traits' architecture but also paves the way for more effective
          drug repurposing and target identification in disease treatment.

          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. We observe that
          diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms
          of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally significant players may lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By encompassing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate in harmony
          with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions.
          Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various
          conditions. It has been demonstrated that this understanding is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual
          genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture posit that gene-gene interactions play a
          pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In recent years, transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          contributing to our understanding of complex traits and facilitating
          the development of new therapies. However, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          progression, necessitating a more comprehensive approach for studying
          genetic associations. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, enabling accurate prediction of known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations
          and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
          highlighting the importance of understanding expression regulation
          across different conditions for determining how genes influence
          complex traits and developing new therapies. This work underscores the
          broader significance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          functional genomics studies to better understand disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          In the broader field of genetics, understanding how genes interact
          with each other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in
          disease origin and progression. However, there remains a gap in our
          understanding of how these interactions contribute to complex traits.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses
          this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

          Genes often work in harmony to carry out their functions within
          specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex
          traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease
          etiology and progression. Our findings indicate a substantial
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. PhenoPLIER, our proposed computational approach,
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint

          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By integrating

          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a significant challenge.
          This mechanistic insight is not only crucial for deciphering disease
          etiology but also for developing new therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, yet they fall short
          in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted
          to play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this
          gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our methodology allows us to
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation analysis, we find that functionally
          important players, despite lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the
          broader significance of our approach in advancing functional genomics
          and drug repurposing through the clustering of complex traits.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease origin and progression. However, current literature lacks a
          comprehensive approach to analyze these interactions and their impact
          on complex traits. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIEER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Using PhenoPLIER, we have observed significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important
          players, despite lacking individual associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study demonstrates the
          effectiveness of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, thus advancing our understanding of complex
          traits and disease mechanisms.

          Genes often collaborate with each other in specific circumstances to
          carry out their functions. To understand how these genes impact
          complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions is required. This insight has proven crucial
          for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease onset and progression. We observe a significant
          association between diseases and modules of co-expressed genes
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players may lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we

          on clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a significant challenge.
          This mechanistic understanding is not only crucial for deciphering
          disease etiology but also for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
          progression. However, current literature lacks a comprehensive
          approach to map these interactions and their implications for complex
          traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          addresses this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach
          reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate prediction of
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. This method not only advances our
          understanding of disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug
          repurposing and therapeutic target identification.

          Genes often collaborate with each other in specific contexts to carry
          out their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to
          complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for
          the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          influence disease etiology and progression. We observe substantial
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          significant players lack individual genetic associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this
          paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of

          In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes interact
          with each other to perform their functions in specific contexts. To
          understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is
          required. This insight is critical for developing new therapies and
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized

          significance of our approach in moving the field forward towards

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how multiple genes interact
          with each other to perform their functions is crucial for determining
          their influence on complex traits. This insight is not only
          fundamental but also critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
          and progression. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of
          how these interactions contribute to complex traits and diseases. Here
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill
          this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our method has
          proven accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, demonstrating that diseases are significantly

          by single-gene strategies, thereby moving the broader field forward
          towards a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions and
          their role in complex traits and diseases.

          Genes often collaborate with each other in specific contexts to carry
          out their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to
          complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
          expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly influence disease onset and progression. We
          observe a significant association between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          we find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this study,
          we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The elucidation of complex traits necessitates a comprehensive
          understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions,
          as genes often work in tandem to carry out their functions. This
          insight is crucial for the development of new therapies, and
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
          progression, highlighting a gap in our understanding of complex trait
          architecture. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps genetic associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions and co-expression
          patterns in understanding complex traits and developing new
          therapeutic strategies, ultimately moving the broader field forward.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin
          and progression. However, current methods often overlook these
          interactions, leading to a gap in our understanding of the complex
          trait architecture. In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

          regulation reveals that functionally important players lack individual
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This study not only fills the gap in understanding gene
          interactions' role in complex traits but also highlights potential
          targets for future therapeutic interventions, advancing our broader
          knowledge of disease mechanisms and treatment strategies.

          Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their

          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions, which is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a crucial yet challenging
          task. This comprehension is not only essential for elucidating disease
          etiology but also for developing new therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene functions in disease-relevant mechanisms, the prediction of
          modern models suggests that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease origin and progression. However, the current
          literature lacks a comprehensive approach to map these interactions
          effectively. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
          designed to fill this gap by mapping genetic associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate prediction
          of known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          found that functionally important players, despite lacking
          associations, were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel approach not only
          advances our understanding of disease etiology but also opens new
          avenues for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.

          Genes often collaborate with each other in specific contexts to carry
          out their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation under various conditions, which is vital for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of the architecture of
          complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          impact disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes with analogous expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and expose
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. We find that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies and deciphering disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a significant part in disease origin and progression. This
          highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that utilizes modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across various conditions to contextualize
          genetic associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          our approach can reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate the
          functional importance of players lacking associations through a CRISPR
          screen analyzing lipid regulation, where trait-associated modules
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER highlight these crucial elements. This study
          underscores the value of considering gene co-expression patterns in
          genetic studies and provides a powerful tool for drug repurposing and
          identifying therapeutic targets.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other in specific contexts is crucial for determining their roles in
          complex traits and disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual gene functions,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease origin and progression. This highlights a gap in

          that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation

          underscores the importance of considering gene interactions when
          studying complex traits and offers a novel approach to reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately
          contributing to the development of new therapies.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a significant challenge.
          This mechanistic understanding is not only crucial for deciphering
          disease etiology but also for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene functions in disease-relevant mechanisms, they often overlook the
          importance of gene-gene interactions, which are predicted to play a
          pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen
          analyzing lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This work underscores the importance of
          considering gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies, which can
          not only highlight disease etiology but also reveal novel therapeutic
          targets and drug mechanisms for repurposing.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other to perform their functions is crucial for determining their
          influence on complex traits. This insight is not only fundamental to
          our comprehension of genetic mechanisms but also critical for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          significant role in disease origin and progression. However, current
          methods often overlook these interactions, creating a gap in our
          understanding of complex traits and their genetic underpinnings. Here,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address
          this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. This method allows us to contextualize
          genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          thereby revealing potential targets that might be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players, despite lacking associations, were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential
          of our approach to uncover novel gene interactions and improve our
          understanding of complex traits, ultimately moving the broader field
          forward.

          Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions, which is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology
          and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By considering
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players may lack
          individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The field of genetics has long been focused on understanding the
          individual roles of genes and how they contribute to complex traits
          and diseases. However, it is increasingly recognized that genes do not
          act in isolation but rather in concert with each other, making
          gene-gene interactions a crucial aspect of disease etiology and
          progression. Despite this, current methods for identifying genetic
          associations often overlook these interactions, leading to missed
          opportunities for drug discovery and therapeutic target
          identification. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
          us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering
          gene interactions in genetic studies and suggest that our approach has
          broad significance for advancing functional genomics and drug
          discovery.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other and influence complex traits is a significant challenge. This
          knowledge is not only crucial for gaining insights into gene
          expression regulation across different conditions but also plays a
          critical role in developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. In this
          paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes

          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players lacking associations were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the
          importance of considering gene interactions in understanding complex
          traits and disease mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader
          field of genetics and therapeutic development.

          Genes often work together to carry out their functions in specific
          contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions, which is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease etiology and

          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players may lack
          individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for understanding
          complex traits and developing effective therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes, they often overlook the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and progression. This paper aims to
          fill this gap by introducing a novel computational approach called
          PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study highlights the
          importance of considering gene co-expression patterns for identifying
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately
          advancing our understanding of complex traits and disease mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genes often collaborate with each other within specific contexts to
          carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide
          context to genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally significant players may lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other to influence complex traits is a significant challenge. This
          knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies and uncovering
          disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual gene functions, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are vital in the origin and progression of
          diseases. In this paper, we address the gap in current literature by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This study highlights the importance of considering gene
          expression patterns and co-expression networks for understanding
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately moving the broader
          field forward towards more effective therapeutic target identification
          and drug repurposing strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          currently a gap in our understanding of these complex interactions and
          their implications for disease treatment. Here, we present PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a

          treatment.

              Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry
              out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack
              individual genetic associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies.

              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in

              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a critical
              challenge. This knowledge is not only essential for gaining
              mechanistic insights into expression regulation across different
              conditions but also plays a pivotal role in developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in understanding the
              impact of gene-gene interactions on complex trait architecture and
              disease progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate
              prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inference of mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking
              associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
              approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. This work underscores the broader significance of
              functional genomics in uncovering disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, paving the way for more effective drug repurposing and
              clustering of complex traits.

              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other to perform their functions in specific contexts is
              crucial for determining their influence on complex traits. This
              insight is not only fundamental but also critical for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to carry
              out their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation under various conditions, which is crucial
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in

              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly impact disease etiology and progression. In this

              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe substantial associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation,
              we find that functionally important players lack genetic
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies.

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a critical
              challenge. This is particularly important in the development of
              new therapies, as modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, there remains a gap in understanding how these genes
              work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
              important players lacking associations were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This approach not only advances our understanding of
              disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing

              The study of complex traits necessitates a comprehensive
              understanding of gene expression regulation across various
              conditions, as genes often work in concert to fulfill their
              functions. This knowledge is not only crucial for academic
              purposes but also has significant implications for the development
              of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms,

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in disease etiology and progression. However,
              current methods lack the ability to effectively analyze these
              interactions. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
              players were prioritized by PhenoPLIER despite lacking individual
              associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This work highlights the importance of considering gene expression
              patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a
              framework for future functional genomics studies and drug
              repurposing efforts.

              The study of complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding
              of gene expression regulation across various conditions, as genes
              work in concert with each other to carry out their functions. This
              knowledge is not only crucial for basic research but also plays a
              significant role in the development of new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              individual roles of genes in disease mechanisms; however, they
              often overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions, which are
              predicted to be critical in disease origin and progression by

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This

              concerted actions of genes in specific contexts, particularly
              their expression regulation across different conditions. This
              knowledge is vital for developing new therapies, as
              transcriptome-wide association studies have demonstrated by
              uncovering individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to the origin and progression of
              diseases, yet this aspect remains largely unexplored. Here we
              present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges
              this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              results show significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate
              prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked
              individual genetic associations but were prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies, thereby moving the broader field forward
              in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to

              In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant role in disease etiology and progression. This

              explore these interactions systematically. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill this gap by
              mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
              method is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions. Through our analysis, we
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the
              accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

              players often lack associations but are prioritized in

              approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER not only
              advances our understanding of disease etiology but also opens up
              new avenues for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other in specific contexts to perform their functions is
              crucial for determining their influence on complex traits. This
              insight is not only fundamental but also critical for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach
              moves the broader field forward by providing a more comprehensive
              understanding of gene interactions in disease mechanisms, thus
              paving the way for novel therapeutic interventions.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              missed by single-gene strategies. This work underscores the
              importance of considering gene interactions in complex traits and
              offers a new method for identifying these interactions, thereby
              moving the broader field forward towards a more comprehensive
              understanding of disease mechanisms.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
              unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under the same conditions. We observe
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules

              predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players may lack
              direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions; understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for

              In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how groups of co-expressed genes influence complex
              traits is a significant challenge. This knowledge gap is
              particularly relevant as it hinders our ability to develop new
              therapies, given that genes often act in concert with each other
              to perform their functions. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and

              computational approach that maps genetic associations and

              The field of genetics has made significant strides in
              understanding the role of individual genes in various complex

              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal

              Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
              integrates genetic association data and pharmacological
              perturbation information into a unified latent representation for
              joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing
              a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally significant actors lack associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              provide context for genetic associations and unveil potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate in
              harmony with each other in specific contexts to execute their
              functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across various conditions, which has been shown to be pivotal for
              the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a vital role in disease etiology and progression.

              In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is pivotal for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.
              However, current methods often overlook these crucial
              interactions. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              designed to fill this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
              players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              approach moves the broader field forward by providing a more

              In the pursuit of understanding complex traits and their
              underlying genetic associations, current transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms. However, there remains a significant
              gap in our knowledge regarding gene-gene interactions and their
              collective influence on these traits. This is particularly
              important as modern models predict that such interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. To bridge this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps

              Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
              integrates genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is founded on gene modules exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in pertinent cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes
              operate in harmony with each other in specific contexts to execute
              their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation across various conditions. It has been demonstrated
              that this understanding is vital for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the
              discovery of individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
              complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease onset and progression.

              In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how groups of co-expressed genes influence complex
              traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in
              disease mechanisms, they often overlook the intricate network of
              gene-gene interactions that are crucial to the origin and
              progression of complex traits. To bridge this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Consequently, our approach not
              only advances the understanding of complex traits' architecture
              but also paves the way for more effective drug repurposing and
              target identification in disease treatment.

              In recent years, transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of complex traits
              and facilitating the development of new therapies. However, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease etiology and progression, necessitating a more
              comprehensive approach for studying genetic associations. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method designed to address
              this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, enabling accurate prediction of known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, highlighting the importance of
              understanding expression regulation across different conditions
              for determining how genes influence complex traits and developing
              new therapies. This work underscores the broader significance of
              considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics studies
              to better understand disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the broader field of genetics, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant part in disease origin and progression. However,
              there remains a gap in our understanding of how these interactions
              contribute to complex traits. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              Genes often work in harmony to carry out their functions within
              specific contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to

              expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital

              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Furthermore, employing a

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a significant
              challenge. This mechanistic insight is not only crucial for
              deciphering disease etiology but also for developing new
              therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, yet they fall short in capturing the

              by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in disease origin and progression. However,
              current literature lacks a comprehensive approach to analyze these
              interactions and their impact on complex traits. This paper aims
              to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIEER, a computational
              method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Using
              PhenoPLIER, we have observed significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players,
              despite lacking individual associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study demonstrates
              the effectiveness of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, thus advancing our understanding
              of complex traits and disease mechanisms.

              Genes often collaborate with each other in specific circumstances
              to carry out their functions. To understand how these genes impact
              complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions is required. This insight has
              proven crucial for the development of new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease onset
              and progression. We observe a significant association between
              diseases and modules of co-expressed genes expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through
              a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players may lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a significant
              challenge. This mechanistic understanding is not only crucial for
              deciphering disease etiology but also for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play

              literature lacks a comprehensive approach to map these

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other to perform their functions is crucial for determining
              their influence on complex traits. This insight is not only
              fundamental but also critical for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease
              origin and progression. However, current literature lacks a
              comprehensive approach to map these interactions and their
              implications for complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action, demonstrating that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, thereby moving the broader field
              forward in understanding complex traits and disease mechanisms.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes often collaborate with each other in specific contexts to
              carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes
              contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive
              understanding of expression regulation across various conditions,
              which is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease etiology
              and progression. We observe substantial associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              significant players lack individual genetic associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this
              paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how multiple genes
              interact with each other to perform their functions is crucial for
              determining their influence on complex traits. This insight is not
              only fundamental but also critical for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a

              remains a gap in our understanding of how these interactions
              contribute to complex traits and diseases. Here we introduce

              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              inferring mechanisms of action, demonstrating that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lack

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes often collaborate with each other in specific contexts to
              carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes
              contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive
              understanding of expression regulation under various conditions.
              This knowledge is vital for the development of new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              influence disease onset and progression. We observe a significant
              association between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              The elucidation of complex traits necessitates a comprehensive
              understanding of gene expression regulation across various
              conditions, as genes often work in tandem to carry out their
              functions. This insight is crucial for the development of new
              therapies, and transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in

              etiology and progression, highlighting a gap in our understanding
              of complex trait architecture. To bridge this gap, we introduce

              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
              disease origin and progression. However, current methods often
              overlook these interactions, leading to a gap in our understanding
              of the complex trait architecture. In this paper, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Using our approach, we observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation reveals
              that functionally important players lack individual associations
              but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              This study not only fills the gap in understanding gene
              interactions' role in complex traits but also highlights potential
              targets for future therapeutic interventions, advancing our

              Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Our
              findings indicate a significant association between diseases and
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a crucial yet
              challenging task. This comprehension is not only essential for
              elucidating disease etiology but also for developing new
              therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual gene functions in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, the prediction of modern models
              suggests that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
              disease origin and progression. However, the current literature
              lacks a comprehensive approach to map these interactions
              effectively. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              designed to fill this gap by mapping genetic associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our approach reveals that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              enabling accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
              important players, despite lacking associations, were prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups

              associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This novel approach not only advances our

              that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology
              and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded
              on modules of genes with analogous expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and expose
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. We find
              that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally significant players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies and deciphering disease etiology. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in disease
              origin and progression. This highlights the need for a
              comprehensive approach to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. In this study, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that utilizes modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across various conditions to
              contextualize genetic associations. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, our approach can reveal potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we validate the functional importance of players
              lacking associations through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation, where trait-associated modules prioritized by
              PhenoPLIER highlight these crucial elements. This study
              underscores the value of considering gene co-expression patterns
              in genetic studies and provides a powerful tool for drug
              repurposing and identifying therapeutic targets.

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other in specific contexts is crucial for determining their
              roles in complex traits and disease mechanisms. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual gene functions, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and
              progression. This highlights a gap in the current literature, as
              there is a need for methods that can effectively capture these
              interactions and contextualize genetic associations. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this
              gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on

              In conclusion, our study underscores the importance of considering
              gene interactions when studying complex traits and offers a novel
              approach to reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, ultimately contributing to the development of new

              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a significant
              challenge. This mechanistic understanding is not only crucial for
              deciphering disease etiology but also for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on individual gene functions in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              they often overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions,
              which are predicted to play a pivotal role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR
              screen analyzing lipid regulation, we found that functionally
              important players lacking associations were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work underscores the
              importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in genetic
              studies, which can not only highlight disease etiology but also
              reveal novel therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms for
              repurposing.

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other to perform their functions is crucial for determining
              their influence on complex traits. This insight is not only
              fundamental to our comprehension of genetic mechanisms but also
              critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide

              gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
              and progression. However, current methods often overlook these
              interactions, creating a gap in our understanding of complex
              traits and their genetic underpinnings. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap.

              Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their

              The field of genetics has long been focused on understanding the
              individual roles of genes and how they contribute to complex
              traits and diseases. However, it is increasingly recognized that
              genes do not act in isolation but rather in concert with each
              other, making gene-gene interactions a crucial aspect of disease
              etiology and progression. Despite this, current methods for
              identifying genetic associations often overlook these
              interactions, leading to missed opportunities for drug discovery
              and therapeutic target identification. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings highlight the importance of considering gene interactions
              in genetic studies and suggest that our approach has broad
              significance for advancing functional genomics and drug discovery.

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other and influence complex traits is a significant
              challenge. This knowledge is not only crucial for gaining insights
              into gene expression regulation across different conditions but
              also plays a critical role in developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              origin and progression. In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore,
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to

              players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the importance of
              considering gene interactions in understanding complex traits and
              disease mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of
              genetics and therapeutic development.

              Genes often work together to carry out their functions in specific
              contexts. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex
              traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly influence disease etiology and progression. In this

              The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for understanding
              complex traits and developing effective therapies. While

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other to perform their functions is crucial for determining
              their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
              disease origin and progression. However, current methods often
              overlook these interactions. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study
              highlights the importance of considering gene interactions in
              understanding complex traits and developing targeted therapies.

              Genes often collaborate with each other within specific contexts
              to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact
              complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is
              vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally significant players may lack associations but

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with

              This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies and

              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
              contextualize genetic associations and potentially uncover targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This not
              only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also
              underscores its broader significance in advancing our
              understanding of complex gene interactions and their role in
              disease treatment.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
