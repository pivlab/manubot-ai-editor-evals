While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results reveal significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, outperforming single-gene strategies. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important players, often overlooked by traditional association methods, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex traits and contributing to the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.

We observe that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players may lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By encompassing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate in harmony with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. It has been demonstrated that this understanding is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture posit that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.

In recent years, transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of complex traits and facilitating the development of new therapies. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression, necessitating a more comprehensive approach for studying genetic associations. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, highlighting the importance of understanding expression regulation across different conditions for determining how genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies. This work underscores the broader significance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics studies to better understand disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes interact with each other to perform their functions in specific contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is required. This insight is critical for developing new therapies and transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the broader significance of our approach in moving the field forward towards understanding complex traits and developing new therapies.

In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies and deciphering disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in disease origin and progression. This highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions to contextualize genetic associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action.

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study highlights the importance of considering gene interactions in understanding complex traits and developing targeted therapies.

Genes often collaborate with each other within specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players may lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
