 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across varying conditions. Such knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly analyzes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them onto a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and we demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a vital role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in genetic associations and provides a novel framework for interpreting these associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for improved drug repurposing and identification of therapeutic targets for complex traits.">[FAIL] (0.88) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.

This novel framework facilitates a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations via gene modules, offering new opportunities for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms in complex traits.

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the broader field forward by highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[PASS] (1.00)  The study of genetic associations and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms has been predominantly focused on individual genes, despite evidence suggesting that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in complex trait architecture. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits.

The foundation of PhenoPLIER lies in the creation of gene modules based on similar expression patterns across corresponding conditions. Our analyses reveal a strong association between diseases and these gene modules in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an examination of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Collectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a valuable tool for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.
