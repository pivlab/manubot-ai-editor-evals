Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across diverse conditions, as this knowledge is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules has the potential to advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics studies.

In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space to facilitate joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene&#39;s role in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents genes based on modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space to facilitate joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents genes based on modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

In the field of functional genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits and disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current methods often lack the ability to capture these interactions and their downstream effects on disease mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting its potential impact on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space to facilitate joint analysis. Genes often function in coordination with one another within specific contexts, and understanding how they collectively influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This level of insight is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER&#39;s representation relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types, and our approach excels in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked due to a lack of individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential therapeutic targets that might be missed through single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations via gene modules.

In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits is critical but remains elusive. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations; however, they do not fully capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and it highlights functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing single-gene strategies and revealing potential targets that may have been overlooked. This research moves the broader field forward by offering a novel method for uncovering gene-gene interactions and their roles in disease mechanisms, with implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.

The field of complex trait analysis has traditionally focused on understanding the role of individual genes, with transcriptome-wide association studies providing valuable insights into disease-relevant mechanisms (e.g., identifying individual genes associated with diseases). However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for new approaches to study these interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing us to associate diseases with relevant gene modules expressed in specific cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules moves the broader field forward by providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex trait architecture, paving the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies on a comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert to influence these conditions. Existing research has shown that the regulation of gene expression across different contexts is critical for uncovering the relationship between genes and complex traits. However, there is a gap in our knowledge regarding the identification of functionally important players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Specifically, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap, our research highlights the broader significance of incorporating gene expression patterns in genetic studies and provides insights into therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for complex traits.

Genes operate in coordination with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions, and an in-depth comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial to elucidate their influence on complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development of novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes, which lack direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER&#39;s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. This study introduces PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting its potential in disease etiology and drug mechanism elucidation, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing.

In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical for bridging the gap between genetic associations and functional genomics. However, current approaches often overlook the importance of gene co-expression and may fail to identify crucial players in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we introduce a novel method, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing new opportunities for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in complex traits.

In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits, particularly in the context of disease etiology and therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current methods for mapping gene-trait associations do not take into account the complex interplay between genes and their regulation across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits, particularly in the context of disease etiology and therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current methods for mapping gene-trait associations do not take into account the complex interplay between genes and their regulation across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. These findings underscore the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics and their implications for understanding complex traits and advancing drug development.

In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. These findings underscore the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics and their implications for understanding complex traits and advancing drug development.

In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not provide a mechanistic understanding of gene-gene interactions. Modern models predict that these interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet current methods for mapping gene-trait associations do not account for this. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We find that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and provide a new method for mapping these interactions. This advancement has the potential to move the broader field of genetics forward by improving our ability to develop new therapies.
