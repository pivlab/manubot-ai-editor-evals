 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, emerging models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is critical for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting drug mechanisms and disease etiology.

 The development of effective therapies relies on a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits and disease mechanisms. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions, they do not fully capture the role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space based on co-expressed gene modules. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show that functionally important genes lacking individual associations can be prioritized through their membership in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations via co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets and revealing previously missed connections between genetics, disease etiology, and drug mechanisms. This approach has the potential to advance our understanding of complex traits and facilitate drug repurposing efforts.">[FAIL] (0.88) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. Recognizing that genes operate in coordination with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions, we posit that a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, and we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

 In specific contexts, genes function cooperatively to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits and develop novel therapies. Our study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes, which lack genetic associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations, highlighting potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for concurrent analysis. This framework is based on modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally vital players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
