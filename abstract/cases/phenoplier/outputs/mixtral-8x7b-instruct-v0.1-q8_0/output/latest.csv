 In the field of genetics and genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather as part of complex networks, exerting their functions in specific contexts (context). A mechanistic understanding of how these genes collectively influence complex traits, particularly through the regulation of gene expression across various conditions, is critical for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and therapy development (gap). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (content). These findings suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules (conclusion). This research thus addresses the gap in our understanding of how to interpret genetic associations in complex traits by offering a powerful new tool for uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets.

 The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies on a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence these conditions, including the role of gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene co-expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Currently, there is a lack of computational approaches that map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space to analyze gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

 In the field of functional genomics, a growing understanding of the importance of gene-gene interactions in complex traits has emerged, prompting the need for new methods to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common framework for joint analysis. Current transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, but they fall short in capturing the complex interplay between genes. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking individual associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may have been missed through traditional single-gene strategies. This research addresses the gap in the current state-of-the-art by providing a novel method to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits, particularly in the context of developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our current knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms by which gene expression regulation across different conditions influences disease associations. In this study, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

By bridging this gap in our understanding, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and has implications for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing (C-C).

Here, we used functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis to develop PhenoPLIER, a novel method that integrates gene expression patterns with genetic association data (C). Our approach involves clustering genes into modules based on their co-expression patterns and assessing the enrichment of trait-associated genetic variants within these modules. We then prioritize genes within these modules based on their functional importance and potential to interact with drugs (C).

Our results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing (C1). Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, suggesting that our approach can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (C2). We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and show that it can identify novel therapeutic targets for complex traits (C1).

Overall, our study highlights the importance of incorporating gene expression patterns in genetic association studies and provides a framework for interpreting these associations through the lens of gene modules (C-C2). By prioritizing functionally important genes that are enriched for trait-associated genetic variants, PhenoPLIER has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts.

We further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, underscoring the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits. Our work thus provides a critical step towards a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and their implications for drug discovery and development.

 In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating gene co-expression patterns to uncover novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for complex traits.

 Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their functions. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of expression across diverse conditions. Such insights are vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, emerging models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This framework is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions.
