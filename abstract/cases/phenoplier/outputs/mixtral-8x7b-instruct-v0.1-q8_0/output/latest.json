          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across varying conditions. Such knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly analyzes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them onto a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and we demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a vital role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

This novel framework facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing a valuable tool for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics and provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby highlighting the broader significance of this approach for functional genomics and drug repurposing in complex trait clustering."

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. Such insight is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that might have been overlooked using single-gene strategies.

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, and we observe significant associations between diseases and these modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lack of individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets that might be missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework provides a new lens for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene modules and holds promise for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery in complex traits.\n\nRevised keywords: 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, computational approaches, gene regulation, disease etiology, pharmacological perturbation.'"

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding how gene-gene interactions contribute to complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms. Current transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they often overlook the importance of gene co-expression patterns and their potential role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal previously overlooked therapeutic targets. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for improved drug repurposing and identification of novel drug mechanisms in complex traits."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function as part of coordinated networks in specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining insights into the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential to understanding how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is mounting evidence suggesting that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules based on their similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Interestingly, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups helps contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our method offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Genes function in coordination with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lacking individual gene associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets that might be overlooked through conventional single-gene strategies. This novel framework facilitates a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations via gene modules, offering new opportunities for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms in complex traits.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies; Functional genomics; Gene co-expression; Therapeutic targets; Drug repurposing; Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits.\n\nThe foundation of PhenoPLIER lies in the creation of gene modules based on similar expression patterns across corresponding conditions. Our analyses reveal a strong association between diseases and these gene modules in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an examination of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nCollectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a valuable tool for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes often function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating their impact on complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's framework relies on gene modules with comparable expression patterns across similar conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nCollectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups provides a means to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our method offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in identifying individual gene-trait associations, yet a comprehensive understanding of how these genes act in concert to influence complex traits remains elusive. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they fail to account for the intricate gene-gene interactions that are critical in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, even prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual gene associations in CRISPR screens analyzing lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately highlighting the broader significance of functional genomics in therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

          "output": " In specific contexts, genes function cooperatively to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is crucial for developing novel therapies. This study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach proves accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation uncovers functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a new approach to understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, with implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies on a comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors that influence these conditions. However, traditional approaches focusing on individual genes often overlook the crucial role of gene co-expression patterns in disease mechanisms. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations onto relevant gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by conventional single-gene strategies. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms, paving the way for more effective drug repurposing and therapeutic development."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This understanding is critical for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. Here, we present a new approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene co-expression patterns across different conditions to project genetic associations onto relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in those cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets that might be missed by single-gene strategies, thereby providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and highlighting new opportunities for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in functional genomics."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact with each other in specific contexts to influence these traits remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to reveal novel therapeutic targets and provide a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The role of genes in the manifestation of complex traits is a subject of ongoing investigation, with particular emphasis on understanding the regulation of gene expression across various contexts. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies and repurposing of existing drugs. In this study, we introduce a new approach called PhenoPLIER that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns to identify significant disease-gene module associations in relevant cell types. Our method demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This research not only fills a gap in our understanding of how genes influence complex traits but also highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER to contribute to drug discovery and repurposing efforts."

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, our approach not only highlights the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also provides a valuable tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not fully capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we validate PhenoPLIER's ability to identify functionally important players that lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to uncover novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": " Genes function cooperatively in specific contexts to execute their roles, and a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This framework is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to identify significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, our analysis using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking individual trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of this approach for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes operate in coordination with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, an analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, our approach has the potential to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby facilitating therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across varying conditions. Such knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly analyzes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them onto a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and we demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics and provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby highlighting the broader significance of this approach for functional genomics and drug repurposing in complex trait clustering.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking individual gene associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, and we observe significant associations between diseases and these modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lack of individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets that might be missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework provides a new lens for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene modules and holds promise for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery in complex traits.\n\nRevised keywords: 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, computational approaches, gene regulation, disease etiology, pharmacological perturbation.'",

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding how gene-gene interactions contribute to complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms. Current transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they often overlook the importance of gene co-expression patterns and their potential role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal previously overlooked therapeutic targets. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for improved drug repurposing and identification of novel drug mechanisms in complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genes function as part of coordinated networks in specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining insights into the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential to understanding how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is mounting evidence suggesting that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules based on their similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Interestingly, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups helps contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our method offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions and has shown to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and functional important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in complex trait and disease studies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under identical conditions.

In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits.\n\nThe foundation of PhenoPLIER lies in the creation of gene modules based on similar expression patterns across corresponding conditions. Our analyses reveal a strong association between diseases and these gene modules in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an examination of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nCollectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a valuable tool for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

Genes often function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating their impact on complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's framework relies on gene modules with comparable expression patterns across similar conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nCollectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups provides a means to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our method offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they fail to account for the intricate gene-gene interactions that are critical in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, even prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual gene associations in CRISPR screens analyzing lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately highlighting the broader significance of functional genomics in therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

            "We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

              "text": " The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies on a comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors that influence these conditions. However, traditional approaches focusing on individual genes often overlook the crucial role of gene co-expression patterns in disease mechanisms. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations onto relevant gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by conventional single-gene strategies. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms, paving the way for more effective drug repurposing and therapeutic development.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, a key challenge is to understand how genes that act in concert with each other influence complex traits. This understanding is critical for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. Here, we present a new approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene co-expression patterns across different conditions to project genetic associations onto relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in those cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets that might be missed by single-gene strategies, thereby providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and highlighting new opportunities for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": " The role of genes in the regulation of complex traits and their potential as therapeutic targets is well-established. However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact with each other in specific contexts to influence these traits remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to reveal novel therapeutic targets and provide a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies and repurposing of existing drugs. In this study, we introduce a new approach called PhenoPLIER that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns to identify significant disease-gene module associations in relevant cell types. Our method demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This research not only fills a gap in our understanding of how genes influence complex traits but also highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER to contribute to drug discovery and repurposing efforts.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

              "text": " In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, our approach not only highlights the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also provides a valuable tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open research question. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in uncovering novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing in complex traits research.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not fully capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we validate PhenoPLIER's ability to identify functionally important players that lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to uncover novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules, highlighting its potential for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns and functional genomics approaches for a better understanding of complex traits and disease etiology, with implications for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. Our findings underscore the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
