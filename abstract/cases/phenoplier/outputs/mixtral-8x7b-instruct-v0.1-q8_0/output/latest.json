Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires insight into the regulation of expression across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetics and genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather as part of complex networks, exerting their functions in specific contexts (context). A mechanistic understanding of how these genes collectively influence complex traits, particularly through the regulation of gene expression across various conditions, is critical for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and therapy development (gap). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (content). These findings suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules (conclusion).

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies on a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence these conditions, including the role of gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene co-expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Currently, there is a lack of computational approaches that map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space to analyze gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression patterns, revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions in disease mechanisms and drug development."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial to deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          "output": " In the field of genetics and functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a promising approach for contextualizing genetic associations and advancing our understanding of complex traits, drug mechanisms, and therapeutic targets."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes' role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " In the field of functional genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather as part of complex networks to influence traits and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are increasingly believed to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that incorporating co-expressed gene groups through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the broader significance of our work in advancing drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification efforts. By providing a more nuanced understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases, PhenoPLIER has the potential to inform new strategies for disease prevention and treatment."

          "output": " In the field of genetics and genomics, it is well-established that genes function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical for developing new therapies, yet existing methods have primarily focused on individual gene associations rather than considering the role of gene-gene interactions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits must consider the collective influence of gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to observe significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's latent representation relies on gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important yet unassociated genes are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER elucidates genetic associations' context, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This study introduces a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, emphasizing functional genomics and therapeutic target identification, as well as drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes function in conjunction with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are substantially associated with these gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In summary, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by contextualizing them through the lens of gene modules, thereby revealing potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of functional genomics, a growing understanding of the importance of gene-gene interactions in complex traits has emerged, prompting the need for new methods to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common framework for joint analysis. Current transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, but they fall short in capturing the complex interplay between genes. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking individual associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may have been missed through traditional single-gene strategies. This research addresses the gap in the current state-of-the-art by providing a novel method to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function in conjunction with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital in developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are notably associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes devoid of associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and illuminate potential targets that might be overlooked through single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in understanding the role of individual genes in complex traits and diseases through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which remains under-explored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to capture the context in which genes act in concert with each other. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby highlighting the broader significance of this work in advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, facilitating joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's representation is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, with accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and the inference of mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally important genes, which may lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that might be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a fresh perspective on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for enhanced therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits is critical but remains elusive. Transcriptome-wide association studies have begun to uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on the creation of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This research moves the broader field forward by addressing the gap in our understanding of how to systematically investigate the relationship between gene expression patterns and complex traits, highlighting the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Our findings demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, emphasizing the utility of our approach for predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes, which may be overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling the contextualization of these associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets that may have been previously missed. Our study underscores the importance of functional genomics and gene co-expression in elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby supporting the development of new therapies and drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical for elucidating how genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. However, current approaches often focus on individual genes rather than groups of co-expressed genes, which can result in important players being overlooked. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing a systems biology approach that incorporates gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, a CRISPR screen analysis tool for lipid regulation. By contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for revealing potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has significant implications for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, as well as for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs."

          "output": " Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to orchestrate complex trait phenotypes, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions for elucidating gene influences on these traits. This knowledge is crucial in developing novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation reveals functionally significant players devoid of individual trait associations, which are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups successfully contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene methodologies. This novel framework facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations through a gene module lens, offering valuable insights for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of functional genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather as part of complex networks to influence various traits and diseases. Despite this understanding, determining the specific genes and interactions within these networks that contribute to complex traits remains a significant challenge. This gap in knowledge is particularly critical for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. Here, we present a new approach, PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and highlights the potential of gene module-based approaches to advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits, particularly in the context of developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our current knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms by which gene expression regulation across different conditions influences disease associations. In this study, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By bridging this gap in our understanding, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and has implications for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing (C-C).\n\nHere, we used functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis to develop PhenoPLIER, a novel method that integrates gene expression patterns with genetic association data (C). Our approach involves clustering genes into modules based on their co-expression patterns and assessing the enrichment of trait-associated genetic variants within these modules. We then prioritize genes within these modules based on their functional importance and potential to interact with drugs (C).\n\nOur results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing (C1). Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, suggesting that our approach can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (C2). We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and show that it can identify novel therapeutic targets for complex traits (C1).\n\nOverall, our study highlights the importance of incorporating gene expression patterns in genetic association studies and provides a framework for interpreting these associations through the lens of gene modules (C-C2). By prioritizing functionally important genes that are enriched for trait-associated genetic variants, PhenoPLIER has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts. Our approach also provides a valuable tool for clustering complex traits based on their underlying gene expression patterns, which can aid in the identification of shared mechanisms across diseases (C-C2)."

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanics of expression regulation across various conditions. Our study underscores the significance of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types in shaping disease associations, and demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally critical genes, which lack individual genetic associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

However, understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. Currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding the integration of gene co-expression patterns in functional genomics studies to project genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Here, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in functional genomics studies, our research moves the broader field forward and provides a framework for drug repurposing and identifying novel therapeutic targets."

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene co-expression in understanding disease etiology. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, demonstrating its potential as a tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. We further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, underscoring the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits. Our work thus provides a critical step towards a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and their implications for drug discovery and development."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their functions. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of expression across diverse conditions. Such insights are vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, emerging models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This framework is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an investigation using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant elements devoid of individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches often struggle to capture these complex relationships. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space, allowing for joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our work thus highlights the potential of integrative approaches for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Such knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture emphasize the critical part gene-gene interactions play in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, facilitating joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Crucially, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lacking individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an examination of lipid regulation via CRISPR screening reveals that functionally significant players devoid of associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires insight into the regulation of expression across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              "text": " In the field of genetics and genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather as part of complex networks, exerting their functions in specific contexts (context). A mechanistic understanding of how these genes collectively influence complex traits, particularly through the regulation of gene expression across various conditions, is critical for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and therapy development (gap). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (content). These findings suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules (conclusion). This research thus addresses the gap in our understanding of how to interpret genetic associations in complex traits by offering a powerful new tool for uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene co-expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Currently, there is a lack of computational approaches that map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space to analyze gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression patterns, revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions in disease mechanisms and drug development.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial to deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a promising approach for contextualizing genetic associations and advancing our understanding of complex traits, drug mechanisms, and therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are increasingly believed to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that incorporating co-expressed gene groups through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the broader significance of our work in advancing drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification efforts.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "text": "Expected output to contain \"CRISPR\"\n---\n In the field of genetics and genomics, it is well-established that genes function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical for developing new therapies, yet existing methods have primarily focused on individual gene associations rather than considering the role of gene-gene interactions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits must consider the collective influence of gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to observe significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We find that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual gene associations in trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations, reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately moving the broader field forward in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's latent representation relies on gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important yet unassociated genes are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER elucidates genetic associations' context, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This study introduces a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, emphasizing functional genomics and therapeutic target identification, as well as drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.",

Genes function in conjunction with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are substantially associated with these gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In summary, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by contextualizing them through the lens of gene modules, thereby revealing potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is centered on modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes devoid of individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

              "text": " In the field of functional genomics, a growing understanding of the importance of gene-gene interactions in complex traits has emerged, prompting the need for new methods to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common framework for joint analysis. Current transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, but they fall short in capturing the complex interplay between genes. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking individual associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may have been missed through traditional single-gene strategies. This research addresses the gap in the current state-of-the-art by providing a novel method to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which remains under-explored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to capture the context in which genes act in concert with each other. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby highlighting the broader significance of this work in advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

              "text": " In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits is critical but remains elusive. Transcriptome-wide association studies have begun to uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on the creation of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This research moves the broader field forward by addressing the gap in our understanding of how to systematically investigate the relationship between gene expression patterns and complex traits, highlighting the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Expected output to contain \"CRISPR\"\n---\n In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits. While previous research has shown that this mechanistic understanding is critical for developing new therapies, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding how to accurately associate diseases with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. In this study, we present a novel approach to address this gap by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis using PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate that this method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and can reveal functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs, moving the broader field of functional genomics forward.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the field of functional genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but instead function in concert with each other within specific contexts. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical for elucidating how genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. However, current approaches often focus on individual genes rather than groups of co-expressed genes, which can result in important players being overlooked. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing a systems biology approach that incorporates gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, a CRISPR screen analysis tool for lipid regulation. By contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for revealing potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has significant implications for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, as well as for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the field of functional genomics, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather as part of complex networks to influence various traits and diseases. Despite this understanding, determining the specific genes and interactions within these networks that contribute to complex traits remains a significant challenge. This gap in knowledge is particularly critical for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. Here, we present a new approach, PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and highlights the potential of gene module-based approaches to advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

However, a gap exists in our current knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms by which gene expression regulation across different conditions influences disease associations. In this study, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By bridging this gap in our understanding, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and has implications for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing (C-C).\n\nHere, we used functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis to develop PhenoPLIER, a novel method that integrates gene expression patterns with genetic association data (C). Our approach involves clustering genes into modules based on their co-expression patterns and assessing the enrichment of trait-associated genetic variants within these modules. We then prioritize genes within these modules based on their functional importance and potential to interact with drugs (C).\n\nOur results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing (C1). Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, suggesting that our approach can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (C2). We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and show that it can identify novel therapeutic targets for complex traits (C1).\n\nOverall, our study highlights the importance of incorporating gene expression patterns in genetic association studies and provides a framework for interpreting these associations through the lens of gene modules (C-C2). By prioritizing functionally important genes that are enriched for trait-associated genetic variants, PhenoPLIER has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts. Our approach also provides a valuable tool for clustering complex traits based on their underlying gene expression patterns, which can aid in the identification of shared mechanisms across diseases (C-C2).",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanics of expression regulation across various conditions. Our study underscores the significance of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types in shaping disease associations, and demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally critical genes, which lack individual genetic associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. As such, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights for disease etiology and drug mechanisms research.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

However, understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. Currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding the integration of gene co-expression patterns in functional genomics studies to project genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Here, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in functional genomics studies, our research moves the broader field forward and provides a framework for drug repurposing and identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene co-expression in understanding disease etiology. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, demonstrating its potential as a tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. We further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, underscoring the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits. Our work thus provides a critical step towards a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and their implications for drug discovery and development.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches often struggle to capture these complex relationships. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space, allowing for joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our work thus highlights the potential of integrative approaches for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease pathophysiology. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method. By providing a systems-level view of genetic factors and their interactions, PhenoPLIER offers valuable insights into disease etiology and highlights potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing, thereby advancing the broader field of functional genomics and precision medicine.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches often struggle to capture these complex relationships. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes with similar expression patterns across conditions as modules, our approach is able to identify significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to advance the field of gene co-expression and uncover new therapeutic targets for drug repurposing, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and diseases.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
