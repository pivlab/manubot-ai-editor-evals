          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how
          these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          across various conditions is critical for elucidating how these genes
          contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms and developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases,
          they do not capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions that are
          predicted to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that

          of considering gene-gene interactions in genetic studies and provides

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific contexts
          to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for
          deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
          of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play
          a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our
          analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that
          functionally important genes lacking individual associations can be
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how
          these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation to enable joint analysis. This representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility
          of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby highlighting the
          importance of functional genomics in elucidating disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how
          these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in uncovering the individual genes' role in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern trait architecture models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally important players lacking individual
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By
          incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets that might be
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Genes operate in concert with one another in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions is critical for
          deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, particularly in
          the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual
          genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations, thereby revealing potential
          targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe

          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other
          in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our
          findings indicate that diseases significantly correlate with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we
          discover that functionally significant genes lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations, highlighting potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes operate in conjunction
          with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions.
          Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          various conditions is vital for elucidating how these genes influence
          complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are essential in disease origin and
          progression.

          The field of genomics has made significant strides in understanding
          the relationship between genes and complex traits, yet there remains a

          In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. This
          common representation is constructed using modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases significantly correlate with these gene modules
          in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant genes, which may be overlooked by single-gene strategies,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a
          contextual understanding of genetic associations, thereby highlighting
          potential targets that might have been missed through conventional
          single-gene approaches. Genes function cooperatively within specific
          contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across various conditions. Previous studies have
          demonstrated the critical importance of this insight for developing
          novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
          significantly contributed to uncovering individual genes' roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture
          of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
          role in disease origin and progression.

          The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
          identifying individual genes associated with various diseases through
          transcriptome-wide association studies. However, there is a growing
          recognition that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the
          etiology of complex traits, which cannot be fully understood through
          the examination of individual genes alone. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes based on
          their expression patterns across relevant cell types, PhenoPLIER
          enables the identification of significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules, revealing potential therapeutic targets.
          Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for drug repurposing.
          Moreover, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important players lacking individual gene associations but are part of
          trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations
          through the analysis of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a more
          comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits,
          paving the way for the development of new therapies.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. This
          approach is built on the foundation of gene modules with similar

          Moreover, through the analysis of a CRISPR screen targeting lipid

          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
          provides a context for genetic associations and highlights potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.


          Genes operate synergistically with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is critical for elucidating how
          these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed
          to the discovery of individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
          origin and progression.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in
          understanding genetic associations with diseases through
          transcriptome-wide association studies. However, these studies often
          overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions and the specific
          cellular contexts in which genes exert their functions. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across relevant conditions. By analyzing disease-gene associations and
          known drug-disease pairs, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts these relationships and reveals mechanisms of action
          (Context). Our approach first determines gene modules with similar
          expression patterns across various conditions and then assesses their
          association with diseases in specific cell types. We validate our
          method using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing
          functionally important players that lack individual gene associations
          but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER
          (Content). Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal previously overlooked therapeutic targets, thereby moving the
          broader field forward in developing new therapies (Conclusion).

          The field of genomics has made significant strides in understanding
          the relationship between genes and complex traits, such as diseases.
          However, current methods primarily focus on individual genes,
          neglecting the critical role of gene-gene interactions. This gap is
          problematic because genes often act in concert with each other to
          influence complex traits, including disease mechanisms. To address
          this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions.


          In our study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
          interactions when studying complex traits and demonstrate how
          PhenoPLIER can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and drug
          discovery. By filling this gap in the current literature, our research
          contributes to the broader context of genomics and complex trait
          architecture, paving the way for more effective therapeutic
          strategies.

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our
          findings indicate that diseases significantly correlate with these
          gene modules in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals
          that functionally critical genes lacking associations are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to
          execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions is essential for
          elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital for
          disease origin and progression.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The field of genetic studies has advanced significantly with the
          advent of functional genomics, particularly in identifying gene-trait
          associations. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how
          these genetic associations translate into functional mechanisms
          underlying diseases and potential drug targets. Here, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, allowing us to observe significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, as shown through a
          CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our findings highlight the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding
          complex trait etiology and suggest that PhenoPLIER could be a valuable
          tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing
          (context).


          To fill this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, which leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait
          associations. Our results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict
          known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, demonstrating
          its potential as a tool for drug repurposing (content). Specifically,
          we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes in
          trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual gene-trait
          associations. This suggests that PhenoPLIER could be used to identify
          novel therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of disease
          mechanisms (conclusion). Moreover, the success of PhenoPLIER
          highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          complex trait etiology and underscores the potential of functional
          genomics approaches for revealing new insights into disease mechanisms
          and drug action.

          The field of genomics has made significant strides in understanding
          the relationship between genes and complex traits, yet there remains a

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our
          findings indicate that diseases significantly correlate with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferes mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
          functionally critical genes lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed
          gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          highlight potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.
          Genes operate in conjunction with each other in specific contexts to
          execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions is vital for
          elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual
          genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          essential in disease origin and progression.

          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the field of functional genomics, a major challenge is to
          understand how genetic associations with complex traits can be
          projected onto gene expression patterns to elucidate disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the identification
          of significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action, and it can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies by contextualizing genetic associations. We demonstrate the
          utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. Overall, our results highlight the importance of
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to reveal the complex
          relationships between genetic associations and disease mechanisms,
          ultimately providing insights critical for developing new therapies.

          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations,
          potentially revealing targets overlooked by single-gene strategies,
          and aid in drug repurposing efforts. Keywords: Genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

          The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies on
          a comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors that contribute
          to their origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been successful in uncovering individual genes associated
          with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease pathogenesis. However,
          current approaches often overlook these interactions, focusing instead
          on individual gene associations. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression
          patterns across relevant conditions. By incorporating these gene
          networks, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing its accuracy
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study thus fills the gap in current
          literature by providing a comprehensive method for projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, and facilitating drug repurposing
          efforts.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function
          in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to regulate complex
          traits. A comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation
          across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how genes
          contribute to disease mechanisms and for developing novel therapies.
          Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental
          in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          processes, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions
          play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to
          address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This method is based on the concept of gene
          modules, or groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. We
          demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by showing its accuracy

          action, and identifying functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. Our findings underscore the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and highlight
          the potential of PhenoPLIER to advance the broader field of genetics
          research.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of genetics and genomics, a comprehensive understanding
          of how genes interact to influence complex traits is crucial for
          elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic
          targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and

          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players

          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby
          providing new insights into the complex interplay of genes in disease
          etiology and therapeutic mechanisms.

          The development of new therapies relies on a mechanistic understanding
          of how genes interact to influence complex traits across different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. However, current methods struggle
          to accurately identify these interactions and their relevance to
          disease. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the
          contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the
          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by observing significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as
          well as its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Our approach not only advances the
          current state-of-the-art in understanding gene-gene interactions but
          also holds promise for improving the development of new therapies by
          identifying previously overlooked targets.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how
          these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in uncovering the individual gene's role in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin
          and progression. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations,
          thereby revealing potential targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene strategies.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of genetics and genomics, a comprehensive understanding
          of how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for
          elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic
          targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          successful in uncovering individual gene associations with diseases,
          they often overlook the important role of gene-gene interactions.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is
          based on the observation that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we show that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of
          considering gene-gene interactions in genetic studies and provide a
          novel approach for identifying therapeutic targets through functional
          genomics. Overall, PhenoPLIER represents an innovative tool for the
          clustering of complex traits, drug repurposing, and the discovery of
          new therapeutic targets.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function
          in concert with one another in specific contexts to influence complex
          traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions is critical for determining how these genes
          contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms and for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant
          role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,

          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by observing significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs, and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This research addresses the need for a method
          to accurately model gene-gene interactions and their role in disease,
          paving the way for more effective therapeutic strategies.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          regulate complex traits across various conditions is essential for
          elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, emerging models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex
          traits. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated
          with clusters of genes (i.e., modules) expressed in pertinent cell
          types. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Herein, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          leverages groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          revealing potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function
          in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to influence complex
          traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across various conditions is critical for elucidating these influences
          and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in uncovering the roles of individual
          genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the
          contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of
          potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies.
          We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          not only highlights the importance of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also provides a valuable tool
          for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing in the
          field of functional genomics.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how
          these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in uncovering the individual gene's role in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin

          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on co-expressed gene modules with similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations, potentially revealing targets that might have been
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function
          in coordination with each other in specific contexts to influence
          complex traits. A comprehensive understanding of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating the
          mechanisms underlying these genetic associations. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant
          processes, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          vital role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent space for joint analysis. This method is based on the concept
          of gene modules with similar expression patterns across various
          conditions. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately
          predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach not
          only highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions
          in disease etiology but also provides a valuable tool for identifying
          novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby
          advancing our understanding of complex traits and their underlying
          mechanisms.

          Genes frequently operate in conjunction with one another within

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a major
          challenge is understanding how genes act in concert to influence
          complex traits, particularly in the context of disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. Currently, there is a
          lack of computational approaches that can effectively map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          framework for joint analysis, particularly one that takes into account
          the modular nature of gene co-expression. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that addresses this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across conditions. We demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show that using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of
          PhenoPLIER to advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of
          complex traits, identify novel therapeutic targets, and facilitate
          drug repurposing.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
          together in specific contexts to regulate complex traits and influence
          disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in these
          processes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current
          methods primarily focus on single-gene associations and may overlook
          important targets. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By grouping genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER is able to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by

          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding
          complex traits and disease mechanisms, and suggest that PhenoPLIER can
          serve as a valuable tool for identifying novel targets for therapeutic
          development.

          Genes often function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate
          complex traits across various conditions is essential for elucidating
          disease etiology and developing novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This
          approach leverages modules of genes with comparable expression
          patterns across identical conditions, thereby contextualizing genetic
          associations and illuminating potential targets that may have been
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results indicate that
          diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is a
          growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act
          in concert with each other to influence complex traits and disease
          outcomes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided
          valuable insights into the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          However, current approaches often overlook these interactions, instead
          focusing on single-gene strategies. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, allowing for the contextualization of genetic associations
          and the revelation of potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.


          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This work highlights the potential of
          incorporating gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies and
          functional genomics, paving the way for improved therapeutic targets
          and drug repurposing strategies in complex traits research.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function
          in concert with each other in specific contexts to influence complex
          traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different conditions is critical for developing new therapies,
          particularly as modern models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, they may overlook important gene-gene
          interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological

          Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific contexts
          to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial for
          elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, particularly in
          the context of developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations, thereby revealing potential
          targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our
          results indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, an analysis of lipid
          regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally significant
          players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a
          comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex
          traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.


          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By highlighting the importance of considering
          gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies and drug repurposing,
          our work advances the broader field of clustering complex traits for
          therapeutic target identification.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
          together in specific contexts to control complex traits through the
          regulation of expression across various conditions. This mechanistic
          understanding is critical for developing novel therapies, particularly
          in the case of diseases where current treatments are insufficient.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, they do not account for the crucial role that gene-gene
          interactions play in disease origin and progression, as predicted by
          modern models of complex trait architecture. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based

          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of
          this approach to move the broader field forward by revealing new
          targets for therapeutic intervention.

          Genes frequently operate in conjunction with one another within
          specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is
          crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits,
          which is vital for the development of novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is
          constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic
          associations, thereby highlighting potential targets that might have
          been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results indicate that
          diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Moreover, we demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen
          focused on lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant
          players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is a
          growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act
          in concert with each other to influence complex traits and disease
          processes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches often
          overlook these interactions, focusing instead on single-gene
          strategies. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for
          the contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lacking individual gene
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the potential of integrating gene
          co-expression networks into genetic studies and functional genomics,
          providing new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, as
          well as identifying novel therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes operate in
          coordination with one another within specific contexts to carry out
          their functions. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          regulate complex traits across various conditions is critical for
          developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual
          genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for
          gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role
          in the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation

          Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development
          of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in uncovering individual genes' roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease origin and progression. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation, enabling joint analysis. This
          representation is derived from modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions, thereby
          contextualizing genetic associations and highlighting potential
          targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our
          findings indicate that diseases are substantially associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant players
          lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is a
          growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes act
          in concert with each other to influence complex traits and disease
          outcomes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. However, current approaches often
          overlook these interactions, instead focusing on single-gene
          strategies. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By incorporating modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER is able to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that
          may have been missed by other methods.


          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that
          PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally
          important players that lack individual gene associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights
          the potential of our approach to reveal novel therapeutic targets and
          improve drug repurposing efforts. Overall, our work underscores the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in genetic studies
          and functional genomics, and provides a powerful new tool for doing
          so.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
          together in specific contexts to control complex traits, and
          understanding the regulation of gene expression across various
          conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          they do not account for the important role of gene-gene interactions
          in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for
          the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification
          of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in

          demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and show that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by our approach. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a much-needed
          tool for understanding the complex interplay between genes and
          disease, paving the way for the development of more effective
          therapies.

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for
              elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is
              vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation
              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
              functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene
              strategies.

              In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes
              function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is critical for
              elucidating how these genes contribute to disease-relevant
              mechanisms and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been successful in identifying individual
              genes associated with diseases, they do not capture the complexity
              of gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
              show that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This work
              highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
              genetic studies and provides a valuable tool for functional
              genomics research, therapeutic target identification, and drug
              repurposing.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific
              contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across various conditions
              is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex
              traits, which is vital for the development of new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our analysis of a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally
              important genes lacking individual associations can be prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may
              have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work

              execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for
              deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is
              vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation to enable joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we
              demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important
              players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, thereby highlighting the importance of functional
              genomics in elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes
              function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for
              elucidating how these genes contribute to disease-relevant
              mechanisms and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role
              of individual genes in complex traits, they do not account for the
              gene-gene interactions that are increasingly recognized as playing
              a critical role in disease origin and progression. Here, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER to advance our
              understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and
              reveal new therapeutic targets.

              Genes operate in concert with one another in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is critical for
              deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, particularly
              in the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
              genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of

              In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes
              function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              regulate complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is critical for
              developing novel therapies, particularly in light of evidence
              indicating that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
              disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the roles
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not
              account for the interactive effects between genes. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation to enable joint analysis based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the
              utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking
              individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby
              advancing the broader field of genetics research.

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that
              diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally significant genes lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations, highlighting potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes operate in conjunction
              with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions.
              Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions is vital for elucidating how these genes
              influence complex traits and developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly
              contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in

              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms; however, current models predict that gene-gene
              interactions are also crucial in this context. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, allowing us to observe significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also
              prioritizing functionally important players that lack direct
              associations but are part of trait-associated modules. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This research not only fills a
              gap in the current literature regarding the role of gene-gene
              interactions in complex traits but also provides critical insights
              for developing new therapies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
              This common representation is constructed using modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our
              findings indicate that diseases significantly correlate with these
              gene modules in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              reveals that functionally significant genes, which may be
              overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating
              co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a contextual
              understanding of genetic associations, thereby highlighting
              potential targets that might have been missed through conventional
              single-gene approaches. Genes function cooperatively within
              specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how
              they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions.
              Previous studies have demonstrated the critical importance of this
              insight for developing novel therapies. Although
              transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly
              contributed to uncovering individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression.

              The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
              identifying individual genes associated with various diseases
              through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, there is
              a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a vital
              role in the etiology of complex traits, which cannot be fully
              understood through the examination of individual genes alone.
              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
              clustering genes based on their expression patterns across
              relevant cell types, PhenoPLIER enables the identification of
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules,
              revealing potential therapeutic targets. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action,
              highlighting its potential for drug repurposing. Moreover, we
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important
              players lacking individual gene associations but are part of
              trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations
              through the analysis of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              more comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex
              traits, paving the way for the development of new therapies.

              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, they do not provide a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. Here, we

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
              This approach is built on the foundation of gene modules with
              similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our
              findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
              these gene modules in specific cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Moreover, through the analysis of a CRISPR screen targeting lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes
              lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
              PhenoPLIER provides a context for genetic associations and
              highlights potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.


              Genes operate synergistically with each other in specific contexts
              to perform their functions. A mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is critical for
              elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have significantly contributed to the discovery of individual
              genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
              progression.

              The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in
              understanding genetic associations with diseases through
              transcriptome-wide association studies. However, these studies
              often overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions and the
              specific cellular contexts in which genes exert their functions.
              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation based on modules of
              co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. By analyzing
              disease-gene associations and known drug-disease pairs, we
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts these
              relationships and reveals mechanisms of action (Context). Our
              approach first determines gene modules with similar expression
              patterns across various conditions and then assesses their
              association with diseases in specific cell types. We validate our
              method using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              revealing functionally important players that lack individual gene
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER (Content). Our findings highlight the potential of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal previously overlooked therapeutic
              targets, thereby moving the broader field forward in developing
              new therapies (Conclusion).

              The field of genomics has made significant strides in
              understanding the relationship between genes and complex traits,
              such as diseases. However, current methods primarily focus on
              individual genes, neglecting the critical role of gene-gene
              interactions. This gap is problematic because genes often act in
              concert with each other to influence complex traits, including
              disease mechanisms. To address this issue, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions.


              In our study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions when studying complex traits and demonstrate how
              PhenoPLIER can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and
              drug discovery. By filling this gap in the current literature, our
              research contributes to the broader context of genomics and
              complex trait architecture, paving the way for more effective
              therapeutic strategies.

            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized

            of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific
            contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
            influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
            expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
            that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
            Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role
            of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
            models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that
              diseases significantly correlate with these gene modules in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally critical genes lacking associations are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating
              co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. Genes operate synergistically within
              specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various
              conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes influence
              complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are vital for disease origin and
              progression.

              The field of genetic studies has advanced significantly with the
              advent of functional genomics, particularly in identifying
              gene-trait associations. However, there is a gap in our
              understanding of how these genetic associations translate into
              functional mechanisms underlying diseases and potential drug
              targets. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              us to observe significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we demonstrate that by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies, as shown through a CRISPR screen
              analyzing lipid regulation. Our findings highlight the importance
              of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex
              trait etiology and suggest that PhenoPLIER could be a valuable
              tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing
              (context).


              To fill this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, which leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal functionally important players that lack individual
              gene-trait associations. Our results show that PhenoPLIER can
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action, demonstrating its potential as a tool for drug
              repurposing (content). Specifically, we found that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important genes in trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack individual gene-trait associations.
              This suggests that PhenoPLIER could be used to identify novel
              therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of disease
              mechanisms (conclusion). Moreover, the success of PhenoPLIER
              highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
              complex trait etiology and underscores the potential of functional
              genomics approaches for revealing new insights into disease
              mechanisms and drug action.

              The field of genomics has made significant strides in

              gene-gene interactions on disease origin and progression. Current

              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

              potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes
              operate in conjunction with each other in specific contexts to

              expression regulation across various conditions is vital for
              elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is
              critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,

              In the field of functional genomics, a major challenge is to
              understand how genetic associations with complex traits can be
              projected onto gene expression patterns to elucidate disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              for the identification of significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action, and it can reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies by contextualizing
              genetic associations. We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that
              functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall,
              our results highlight the importance of incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes to reveal the complex relationships between
              genetic associations and disease mechanisms, ultimately providing
              insights critical for developing new therapies.

              on a comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors that
              contribute to their origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              uncovering individual genes associated with disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a critical role in disease pathogenesis. However, current
              approaches often overlook these interactions, focusing instead on
              individual gene associations. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar
              expression patterns across relevant conditions. By incorporating
              these gene networks, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
              approach by showing its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our study thus fills the gap in current literature by
              providing a comprehensive method for projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and facilitating drug
              repurposing efforts.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              regulate complex traits. A comprehensive understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for
              elucidating how genes contribute to disease mechanisms and for
              developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant processes, there is a
              growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a significant
              role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to address
              this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This method is based on the concept of gene modules, or
              groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by showing its
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring
              mechanisms of action, and identifying functionally important
              players lacking individual gene associations but prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. Our findings underscore the importance
              of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex
              traits and highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to advance the
              broader field of genetics research.

              The development of new therapies relies on a mechanistic
              understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits
              across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, current methods struggle to accurately
              identify these interactions and their relevance to disease. Here,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the
              contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate
              the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by observing significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, as well as its accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Our
              approach not only advances the current state-of-the-art in
              understanding gene-gene interactions but also holds promise for
              improving the development of new therapies by identifying
              previously overlooked targets.

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is essential to
              elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is
              critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the
              individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. Our
              findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint

              In the field of genetics and genomics, a comprehensive
              understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is
              critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel
              therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations
              with diseases, they often overlook the important role of gene-gene
              interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is based on the observation that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we show that functionally important players lacking
              individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of
              considering gene-gene interactions in genetic studies and provide
              a novel approach for identifying therapeutic targets through
              functional genomics. Overall, PhenoPLIER represents an innovative
              tool for the clustering of complex traits, drug repurposing, and
              the discovery of new therapeutic targets.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              function in concert with one another in specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions is critical for
              determining how these genes contribute to disease-relevant
              mechanisms and for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
              disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by
              observing significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
              known drug-disease pairs, and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation,
              we find that functionally important players lacking individual
              gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This research addresses the need for a method to
              accurately model gene-gene interactions and their role in disease,
              paving the way for more effective therapeutic strategies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these
              genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in identifying the involvement of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, emerging models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and
              progression of complex traits. Our findings indicate that diseases
              are strongly associated with clusters of genes (i.e., modules)
              expressed in pertinent cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of
              our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing
              lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes
              lacking individual associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Herein, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
              leverages groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions to contextualize genetic associations,
              thereby revealing potential targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene strategies.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the

              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is essential to
              elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is
              critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the
              individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. Our
              findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis.
              This representation is based on co-expressed gene modules with
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations, potentially revealing targets
              that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes
              function in coordination with each other in specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. A comprehensive understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is essential for
              elucidating the mechanisms underlying these genetic associations.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with
              disease-relevant processes, recent models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and
              progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for
              joint analysis. This method is based on the concept of gene
              modules with similar expression patterns across various
              conditions. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. This approach not only highlights the importance of
              considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology but also
              provides a valuable tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing our
              understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms.

              Genes frequently operate in conjunction with one another within
              specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying
              conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence
              complex traits, which is vital for the development of novel
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is constructed on the basis of gene modules
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions, thereby enabling the contextualization of genetic
              associations and the identification of potential targets that may
              have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results
              indicate that diseases are substantially associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid
              regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally
              significant players lacking individual associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a major
              challenge is understanding how genes act in concert to influence
              complex traits, particularly in the context of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Currently, there is a lack of computational
              approaches that can effectively map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common framework for
              joint analysis, particularly one that takes into account the
              modular nature of gene co-expression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that addresses this gap
              by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              conditions. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies, accurately predict known
              drug-disease pairs, and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              we show that using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to
              advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex
              traits, identify novel therapeutic targets, and facilitate drug
              repurposing.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
              together in specific contexts to regulate complex traits and
              influence disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of
              individual genes in these processes, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is

            PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in

              Genes often function cooperatively within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these
              genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in identifying the involvement of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to disease origin and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach leverages
              modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across
              identical conditions, thereby contextualizing genetic associations
              and illuminating potential targets that may have been overlooked
              by single-gene strategies. Our results indicate that diseases are
              substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen
              reveals that functionally significant genes lacking individual
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is
              a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes
              act in concert with each other to influence complex traits and
              disease outcomes. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes
              in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, current approaches often overlook these
              interactions, instead focusing on single-gene strategies. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              for the contextualization of genetic associations and the
              revelation of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work highlights the
              potential of incorporating gene co-expression patterns in genetic
              studies and functional genomics, paving the way for improved
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies in complex
              traits research.

              Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a
              comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence
              complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin
              and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By highlighting the
              importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in genetic
              studies and drug repurposing, our work advances the broader field
              of clustering complex traits for therapeutic target
              identification.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
              together in specific contexts to control complex traits through
              the regulation of expression across various conditions. This
              mechanistic understanding is critical for developing novel
              therapies, particularly in the case of diseases where current
              treatments are insufficient. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the
              crucial role that gene-gene interactions play in disease origin
              and progression, as predicted by modern models of complex trait
              architecture. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              Genes frequently operate in conjunction with one another within
              specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various
              conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence
              complex traits, which is vital for the development of novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis.
              This common representation is constructed based on modules of

              conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations, thereby
              highlighting potential targets that might have been overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. Our results indicate that diseases are
              substantially associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. Moreover, we demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen focused on

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is
              a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes
              act in concert with each other to influence complex traits and
              disease processes. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, current approaches often overlook these
              interactions, focusing instead on single-gene strategies. Here, we

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              operate in coordination with one another within specific contexts
              to carry out their functions. A comprehensive understanding of how
              these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is
              critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not
              account for gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a
              significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits.
              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

              Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is
              a growing recognition of the importance of understanding how genes
              act in concert with each other to influence complex traits and
              disease outcomes. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, current approaches often overlook these
              interactions, instead focusing on single-gene strategies. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By incorporating modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER is able
              to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              that may have been missed by other methods.


              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that
              PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that
              functionally important players that lack individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach to
              reveal novel therapeutic targets and improve drug repurposing
              efforts. Overall, our work underscores the importance of
              considering gene-gene interactions in genetic studies and
              functional genomics, and provides a powerful new tool for doing
              so.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
              together in specific contexts to control complex traits, and
              understanding the regulation of gene expression across various
              conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, they do not account for the important role of
              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, allowing for the contextualization of genetic
              associations and the identification of potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate
              the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and show that functionally important players lacking
              individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by our approach. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a
              much-needed tool for understanding the complex interplay between
              genes and disease, paving the way for the development of more
              effective therapies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
