          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of
          expression across diverse conditions, as this knowledge is critical
          for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in uncovering the involvement of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          analyzing lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and highlight
          potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function
          in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to carry out
          their roles. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of
          expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is
          critical for developing novel therapies, as transcriptome-wide
          association studies have demonstrated the role of individual genes in

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms
          underlying complex traits and developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          identifying individual genes associated with diseases, they do not
          provide a comprehensive view of gene-gene interactions that play a

          are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these
          genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is critical for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important
          players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies.
          Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes act in
          concert to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          uncovering individual gene associations with diseases, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the
          origin and progression of complex traits. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across relevant conditions.


          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules has
          significant implications for understanding disease etiology,

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work in
          concert with each other in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across various conditions is crucial for uncovering how these genes
          influence complex traits and developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, they do not account for the significant impact of
          gene-gene interactions on disease origin and progression, as predicted
          by modern models of complex trait architecture.


          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for
          the examination of diseases' significant association with specific
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.


          Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation
          revealed that functionally important players lacking individual gene
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by our
          method. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that
          may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules moves the broader field forward by providing a more

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these
          genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression
          regulation across various conditions. Such knowledge is critical for
          developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
          players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies.
          Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function
          in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to influence complex
          traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions is critical for elucidating how these genes
          contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms and for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in complex
          traits, they do not account for the potential impact of gene-gene
          interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules
          of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
          We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules has the potential to
          advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          functional genomics studies.

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these
          genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression
          regulation across varying conditions. Such knowledge is critical for
          the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
          of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          vital to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for
          joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find
          that functionally important players lacking individual associations
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene
          strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function
          in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to carry out
          their roles. However, understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across various conditions, as this insight is critical for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in

          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our
          findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations
          were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern

          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of
          how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open
          question, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug
          development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not account for
          the critical role that gene-gene interactions play in disease origin
          and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
          utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER thus
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, with implications for both
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space to facilitate joint analysis. Genes
          function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions is essential to decipher how these genes
          influence complex traits, which is vital for novel therapy
          development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
          progression. PhenoPLIER represents genes based on modules with similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate
          that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
          incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic
          associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules.

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          In the field of functional genomics, there is a growing recognition
          that genes act in concert with each other to influence complex traits
          and disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. However, current methods often lack
          the ability to capture these interactions and their downstream effects
          on disease mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
          observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting its
          potential impact on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent space, enabling joint
          analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific
          contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for
          developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes
          involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents
          gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly
          associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally important genes lacking individual
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules. In
          summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups
          enables contextualization of genetic associations and highlights
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
          innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light
          on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in
          understanding the relationship between genetic variation and complex
          traits, yet there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding the role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. Current
          methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have been
          successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations but fall
          short in capturing the complexity of gene regulation and interaction.
          Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method is based
          on the representation of modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across different conditions, allowing us to identify
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action, as well as its ability to prioritize functionally important
          players that lack individual gene-trait associations. Through the
          integration of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This research moves the
          broader field forward by highlighting the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and identifying
          therapeutic targets, as well as providing a new tool for drug
          repurposing and functional genomics studies.

          In the field of genomics and pharmacology, understanding how genes
          influence complex traits and diseases is critical for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          However, current methods often lack the ability to effectively analyze

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent space, enabling joint
          analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific
          contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions is essential to
          decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for
          the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes
          involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence
          suggesting that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the
          etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's
          representation relies on modules of genes with comparable expression
          patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, an
          analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that
          functionally important players lacking individual associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can
          contextualize genetic associations, highlighting potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. This method provides a fresh
          perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, thereby facilitating the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of
          how genes act in concert to influence complex traits remains an open
          question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on individual gene-trait associations, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and
          progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our method is based on the creation of modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing us to
          identify significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules has broader implications for
          highlighting disease etiology, drug mechanisms, therapeutic targets,
          and drug repurposing in complex trait clustering.

          The development of new therapies relies on a mechanistic understanding

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space to facilitate joint analysis. Genes
          often function in coordination with one another within specific
          contexts, and understanding how they collectively influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression
          regulation across various conditions. This level of insight is vital
          for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual
          genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on
          the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules
          in relevant cell types, and our approach excels in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an
          analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that
          functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked due to
          a lack of individual associations, are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
          incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the
          contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential
          therapeutic targets that might be missed through single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on
          interpreting genetic associations via gene modules.

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of
          how genes influence complex traits is critical but remains elusive.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          uncovering individual gene-trait associations; however, they do not
          fully capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted
          to play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes
          as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions,
          PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and
          it highlights functionally important players that lack individual
          gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, contextualizing single-gene strategies and
          revealing potential targets that may have been overlooked. This
          research moves the broader field forward by offering a novel method
          for uncovering gene-gene interactions and their roles in disease
          mechanisms, with implications for therapeutic target identification
          and drug repurposing.

          The field of complex trait analysis has traditionally focused on
          understanding the role of individual genes, with transcriptome-wide
          association studies providing valuable insights into disease-relevant
          mechanisms (e.g., identifying individual genes associated with
          diseases). However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, highlighting
          the need for new approaches to study these interactions. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different
          conditions, allowing us to associate diseases with relevant gene
          modules expressed in specific cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy
          of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated

          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
          moves the broader field forward by providing a more comprehensive
          understanding of complex trait architecture, paving the way for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how
          these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing
          effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence suggesting that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and
          progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on
          aggregating genes with similar expression patterns across comparable
          conditions into modules. Our results demonstrate a significant
          association between diseases and these gene modules in relevant cell
          types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes
          lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate
          co-expressed gene groups provides a new framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          highlighting potential targets that may have been overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. The keywords associated with this manuscript
          include 'genetic studies,' 'functional genomics,' 'gene

          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of
          how genes act in concert to influence complex traits remains an open
          question, with significant implications for drug discovery and
          repurposing. Existing methods, such as transcriptome-wide association
          studies, have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait
          associations but fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene
          interactions that are critical for deciphering disease etiology and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling joint
          analysis of these datasets through the lens of gene modules. We
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen,
          we find that functionally important players lacking individual
          gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, providing a framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules and advancing the
          broader field of functional genomics.

          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context

          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          The development of new therapies relies on a mechanistic understanding
          of how genes, which act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions, influence complex traits. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. Currently, there is a
          lack of computational approaches that can map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis, particularly those that consider
          the collective influence of genes with similar expression patterns
          across different conditions on complex traits. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types and that our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we

          Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our
          understanding of the complex relationship between genes and disease
          and facilitating the development of new therapies.

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
          their roles, and gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating their
          influence on complex traits. This knowledge is vital for developing
          novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases exhibit significant
          associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
          Moreover, our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a
          CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally critical elements lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
          integration of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of
          genetic associations and highlights potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. This novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER
          facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations through the
          lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a crucial gap
          exists in our understanding of how genes act in concert to influence
          complex traits and disease etiology. While it is known that genes
          function in specific contexts through expression regulation, current
          approaches often overlook the importance of gene co-expression across
          different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies
          and repurposing existing drugs. In this study, we introduce a novel
          method, PhenoPLIER, that addresses this gap by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By analyzing
          diseases' significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate the
          power of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid
          regulation, where functionally important players lacking individual
          gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
          findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          providing new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          paving the way for more effective therapeutic target identification
          and drug repurposing strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function
          in concert with one another within specific contexts to influence
          complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions is crucial for developing
          effective therapies. However, a gap exists in our current knowledge
          regarding how to accurately associate diseases with relevant gene
          modules expressed in particular cell types. In this study, we address
          this gap by presenting a novel approach that combines the use of
          PhenoPLIER, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, and an analysis of
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate that this method is
          successful in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. This
          framework not only provides a more accurate way to associate diseases
          with relevant gene modules expressed in specific cell types but also
          highlights the broader significance of interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for the
          development of novel therapies.

          In specific contexts, genes function cooperatively to execute their
          roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence
          complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Our
          study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach
          demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation uncovers functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene
          groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and reveals
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through

          The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies on
          a comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert to influence
          these conditions. Existing research has shown that the regulation of
          gene expression across different contexts is critical for uncovering
          the relationship between genes and complex traits. However, there is a
          gap in our knowledge regarding the identification of functionally
          important players that lack direct genetic associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules. Here, we present a novel
          approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes
          to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Specifically,
          through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking genetic associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling this
          gap, our research highlights the broader significance of incorporating
          gene expression patterns in genetic studies and provides insights into
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function
          in concert with one another in specific contexts to influence complex
          traits. However, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions is necessary to determine how these genes
          contribute to diseases. This knowledge is critical for developing new
          therapies. The current study aimed to fill the gap in the literature
          regarding the incorporation of co-expressed gene groups in the
          interpretation of genetic associations and the identification of
          potential targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational framework that utilizes gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types to associate diseases with genes. Our approach was
          successful in accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players
          lacking direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          framework provides a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing the
          broader field of genetics research.

          Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their
          roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing
          novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases exhibit significant
          associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. We
          demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally crucial elements devoid of associations are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
          incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of
          genetic associations and the revelation of potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene
          modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that
          understanding how genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts is critical for uncovering the mechanisms underlying complex
          traits and developing new therapies. However, a gap remains in our
          ability to accurately associate diseases with relevant gene modules
          and predict drug-disease pairs based on gene expression patterns.
          Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates
          groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          demonstrate the accuracy of our method in associating diseases with
          relevant gene modules and predicting known drug-disease pairs, as well
          as its ability to infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show
          that functionally important players lacking individual gene
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to

          through the lens of gene modules and shed light on disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the advancement of

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function
          in concert with one another in specific contexts to influence complex
          traits. However, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions is necessary to determine how these genes
          impact such traits, and this knowledge is critical for developing new
          therapies. Despite the importance of this issue, there is a gap in the
          current literature regarding the integration of co-expressed gene
          groups in the interpretation of genetic associations. In this study,
          we address this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          approach, which involves using PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation
          through a CRISPR screen, proves accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, revealing potential targets
          that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our results suggest that
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby contextualizing
          genetic associations and potentially leading to new therapeutic
          approaches.

          In specific contexts, genes function cooperatively to execute their
          roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence
          complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Our
          study reveals a significant association between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene
          groups can contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and

          In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of
          how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open
          question. While it is recognized that genes often act in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          determining the precise mechanisms by which these genes contribute to
          disease susceptibility and drug response requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          Currently, most genetic studies focus on single-gene associations,
          which may overlook important functional relationships between genes.
          Here, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that incorporates
          groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by showing that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking single-gene associations are

          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way
          for more effective functional genomics studies and therapeutic target
          identification.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to regulate
          complex traits is crucial for developing effective therapies. Despite
          previous research on gene expression regulation across different
          conditions, there remains a gap in knowledge regarding the specific
          impact of gene modules on diseases and their associated mechanisms of
          action. This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the
          relationship between gene modules and diseases, as well as inferring
          potential drug targets and mechanisms of action. Our novel approach
          involves utilizing CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation and
          employing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations through
          co-expressed gene groups. The results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and prioritizing functionally important players
          lacking direct associations. By incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          reveals potential targets missed by traditional single-gene
          strategies, providing a valuable framework for interpreting genetic
          associations in the context of complex trait regulation. This research
          not only fills a critical gap in the current literature but also
          offers new insights and tools for developing targeted therapies in the
          broader field of genetics.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in coordination with one another within specific
          contexts to execute their functions, and an in-depth comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial to
          elucidate their influence on complex traits. This understanding is
          vital for the development of novel therapies. Our study reveals that
          diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types, and our method proves effective in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing
          a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important genes, which lack direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the
          contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential
          targets that might have been overlooked using single-gene strategies.
          This study introduces PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          highlighting its potential in disease etiology and drug mechanism
          elucidation, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing.

          In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that
          genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions is critical for bridging the
          gap between genetic associations and functional genomics. However,
          current approaches often overlook the importance of gene co-expression
          and may fail to identify crucial players in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. In this study, we introduce a novel method, PhenoPLIER,
          which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed
          by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

          potential of PhenoPLIER as a framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, providing new
          opportunities for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in complex
          traits.

          In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work in
          concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes
          influence complex traits and developing new therapies. However, a gap
          exists in the current literature regarding the integration of gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types for the analysis of diseases
          and drug-disease pairs. Here, we present a novel approach that
          utilizes PhenoPLIER to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes,
          thereby contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential
          targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. Our

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is

          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study not only fills the
          gap in the current literature but also provides a novel framework for

          thereby moving the broader field forward.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions for deciphering their influence
          on complex traits. Such knowledge is critical for the development of
          novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          the architecture of complex traits implies that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this
          study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on gene
          modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover,
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that functionally important genes, which lack
          individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a
          comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert with each
          other to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating disease
          etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been successful in uncovering individual
          gene-trait associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of
          diseases. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across various conditions.


          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important
          players lacking individual gene-trait associations were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential
          of our approach for drug repurposing and uncovering novel therapeutic
          targets in complex traits. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful
          framework for integrating gene expression patterns with genetic
          association studies, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits and diseases is a critical yet unresolved
          issue. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fall
          short in capturing gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we address this
          gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to observe
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we
          demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players
          lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by our approach. By providing a more
          comprehensive understanding of gene interactions in complex traits and
          diseases, PhenoPLIER moves the broader field forward towards
          developing new therapies.

          Genes operate in collaboration with each other within specific
          contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is
          essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which
          is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid
          regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important
          players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the
          importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other
          to influence complex traits, particularly in the context of disease
          etiology and therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual
          genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. However, current methods for mapping gene-trait
          associations do not take into account the complex interplay between
          genes and their regulation across different conditions. To address
          this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types and that our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

          important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules. Our findings underscore the importance of
          considering gene-gene interactions in genetic studies and provide a
          powerful new tool for functional genomics, therapeutic target
          identification, and drug repurposing.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is crucial for developing effective
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
          progression. However, current approaches often overlook these
          interactions, focusing instead on individual gene-trait associations.
          Here, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
          identify significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important
          players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of
          this approach to uncover novel insights into complex trait regulation.
          Overall, our study provides a much-needed framework for investigating
          gene-gene interactions in complex traits and has important
          implications for the development of new therapies.

          Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development
          of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in uncovering individual genes' roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease origin and progression. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that amalgamates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is derived from modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that
          diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, an analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals functionally important players lacking associations but
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how
          genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in
          capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are believed to
          play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address
          this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This is achieved
          through the creation of modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation
          and discovered that functionally important players lacking individual
          gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          our approach. This research highlights the potential of functional
          genomics and gene co-expression analysis in uncovering novel
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing for complex
          traits.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate in collaboration with each other within specific
          contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is
          essential for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits,
          which is critical for the development of novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly
          to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates
          high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, an analysis of a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking
          associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Therefore, our approach highlights disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms through the projection of genetic associations using
          gene expression patterns, enabling the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of the
          importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each other
          to influence complex traits, particularly in the context of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual
          genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. However, current methods for mapping gene-trait
          associations do not account for these interactions, limiting their
          ability to accurately predict therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          opportunities. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how
          genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease
          origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.


          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important
          players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential for
          drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. These
          findings underscore the importance of considering gene-gene
          interactions in functional genomics and their implications for
          understanding complex traits and advancing drug development.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is critical for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, they do not provide a mechanistic understanding of
          gene-gene interactions. Modern models predict that these interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet current
          methods for mapping gene-trait associations do not account for this.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations
          between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. We find that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known

          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking individual gene associations
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results
          demonstrate the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          understanding complex traits and provide a new method for mapping
          these interactions. This advancement has the potential to move the
          broader field of genetics forward by improving our ability to develop

            manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a
            single paragraph. The revision should follow a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
            context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
            fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
            broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then,
            the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the
            research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the
            research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art,
            communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the
            specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the
            specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g.
            "here we") first describes the novel method or approach that was
            used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results.
            3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the
            question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may
            be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this
            conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these
              genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the
              regulation of expression across diverse conditions, as this
              knowledge is critical for developing novel therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              uncovering the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets
              that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
              shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes
              function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts
              to carry out their roles. However, a comprehensive understanding
              of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various
              conditions. This insight is critical for developing novel
              therapies, as transcriptome-wide association studies have
              demonstrated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. Nevertheless, modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial to
              disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering the
              mechanisms underlying complex traits and developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful
              in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, they do
              not provide a comprehensive view of gene-gene interactions that
              play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of genes with

              that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how
              these genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is critical
              for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while
              inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis
              of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players
              lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using
              single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes act
              in concert to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating
              disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              uncovering individual gene associations with diseases, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role
              in the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.


              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules has significant implications for understanding
              disease etiology, identifying therapeutic targets, and repurposing

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
              in concert with each other in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across various conditions is crucial for uncovering how
              these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the
              significant impact of gene-gene interactions on disease origin and
              progression, as predicted by modern models of complex trait
              architecture.


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, allowing for the examination of diseases' significant
              association with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infer mechanisms of action.


              Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation
              revealed that functionally important players lacking individual
              gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              our method. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules moves the broader
              field forward by providing a more comprehensive understanding of
              complex trait regulation.

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how
              these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into
              expression regulation across various conditions. Such knowledge is
              critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for
              joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
              find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              discover that functionally important players lacking individual
              gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked
              using single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions is critical for
              elucidating how these genes contribute to disease-relevant
              mechanisms and for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in complex traits, they do
              not account for the potential impact of gene-gene interactions.
              Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules has the potential to advance our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, and highlights the importance of

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how
              these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into
              expression regulation across varying conditions. Such knowledge is
              critical for the development of novel therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to
              disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using
              single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes
              function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts
              to carry out their roles. However, understanding how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across various conditions, as this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
              disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. This research thus fills a critical gap in the current
              state-of-the-art by offering a new methodological approach that
              accounts for gene-gene interactions and highlights their
              importance in disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and therapeutic
              target identification.

              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding
              of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open
              question, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug
              development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not
              account for the critical role that gene-gene interactions play in
              disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that
              functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
              findings highlight the importance of incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER thus provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with
              implications for both therapeutic target identification and drug
              repurposing.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts
              to carry out their roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for
              elucidating how these genes contribute to complex traits and
              developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease
              origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent

              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space to facilitate joint
              analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific
              contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is essential to
              decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital
              for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role
              in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER
              represents genes based on modules with similar expression patterns
              across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases
              are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can
              contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, there is a growing
              recognition that genes act in concert with each other to influence
              complex traits and disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been successful in uncovering individual
              gene-trait associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, current methods often lack the ability to
              capture these interactions and their downstream effects on disease
              mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
              observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of
              PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest
              that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, highlighting its potential impact on disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the field of genomics and pharmacology, a major challenge is
              understanding how genes that act in concert influence complex
              traits and diseases, as current approaches primarily focus on
              individual gene-trait associations. This gap is significant
              because an integrated view of gene interactions is critical for
              developing new therapies and for uncovering functionally important

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space, enabling joint
              analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific
              contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight
              is vital for developing effective therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              uncovering the individual genes involved in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with
              similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our
              findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with these
              gene modules in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by
              analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, revealing that
              functionally important genes lacking individual associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables
              contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative
              framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding
              light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in
              understanding the relationship between genetic variation and
              complex traits, yet there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding
              the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
              progression. Current methods, such as transcriptome-wide
              association studies, have been successful in uncovering individual
              gene-trait associations but fall short in capturing the complexity
              of gene regulation and interaction. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. Our method is based on the
              representation of modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions, allowing us to identify
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of
              PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action, as well as its ability to prioritize
              functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait
              associations. Through the integration of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This research moves the broader field forward by
              highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions
              in understanding complex traits and identifying therapeutic
              targets, as well as providing a new tool for drug repurposing and
              functional genomics studies.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

              In the field of genomics and pharmacology, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits and diseases is critical for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, current methods often lack the ability to
              effectively analyze these interactions. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions, allowing us to observe significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. We find that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and
              furthermore, it can reveal functionally important players that
              lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
              contextualizing these associations and revealing potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This research addresses the gap
              in the current literature regarding the analysis of gene-gene
              interactions and their role in disease, providing a valuable tool
              for the broader field of genomics and pharmacology.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space, enabling joint
              analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific
              contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is essential to
              decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in identifying
              individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is
              growing evidence suggesting that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of
              complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of
              genes with comparable expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid
              regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally
              important players lacking individual associations are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can
              contextualize genetic associations, highlighting potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This method provides a fresh
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, thereby facilitating the identification of novel
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

              In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding
              of how genes act in concert to influence complex traits remains an
              open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on individual gene-trait associations, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in
              disease etiology and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on the
              creation of modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across various conditions, allowing us to identify significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
              has broader implications for highlighting disease etiology, drug
              mechanisms, therapeutic targets, and drug repurposing in complex

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene

              The development of new therapies relies on a mechanistic
              understanding of how genes, which function in concert with each
              other in specific contexts, influence complex traits. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current
              methods struggle to account for these interactions. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach
              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              work highlights the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions in understanding complex traits and provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, thereby moving the broader field forward.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space to facilitate joint
              analysis. Genes often function in coordination with one another
              within specific contexts, and understanding how they collectively
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation
              of expression regulation across various conditions. This level of
              insight is vital for the development of novel therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex
              traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation relies on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that
              diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules in
              relevant cell types, and our approach excels in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that
              functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked
              due to a lack of individual associations, are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
              incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the
              contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential
              therapeutic targets that might be missed through single-gene
              strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on
              interpreting genetic associations via gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding
              of how genes influence complex traits is critical but remains
              elusive. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations;
              however, they do not fully capture the intricate gene-gene
              interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in
              disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as
              modules with similar expression patterns across various
              conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer
              mechanisms of action, and it highlights functionally important
              players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, contextualizing single-gene strategies and revealing
              potential targets that may have been overlooked. This research
              moves the broader field forward by offering a novel method for
              uncovering gene-gene interactions and their roles in disease
              mechanisms, with implications for therapeutic target

              The field of complex trait analysis has traditionally focused on
              understanding the role of individual genes, with
              transcriptome-wide association studies providing valuable insights
              into disease-relevant mechanisms (e.g., identifying individual
              genes associated with diseases). However, modern models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin
              and progression, highlighting the need for new approaches to study
              these interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions, allowing us to
              associate diseases with relevant gene modules expressed in
              specific cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules moves the broader field forward by providing
              a more comprehensive understanding of complex trait architecture,
              paving the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how
              these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for
              developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in identifying
              individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is
              growing evidence suggesting that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of
              complex traits. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on aggregating
              genes with similar expression patterns across comparable
              conditions into modules. Our results demonstrate a significant
              association between diseases and these gene modules in relevant
              cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important genes lacking individual associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups
              provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential
              targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding
              of how genes act in concert to influence complex traits remains an
              open question, with significant implications for drug discovery
              and repurposing. Existing methods, such as transcriptome-wide
              association studies, have been successful in uncovering individual
              gene-trait associations but fall short in capturing the intricate
              gene-gene interactions that are critical for deciphering disease
              etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation, enabling joint analysis of these datasets through

              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              The development of new therapies relies on a mechanistic
              understanding of how genes, which act in concert with each other
              in specific contexts to perform their functions, influence complex
              traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Currently, there is a lack of computational
              approaches that can map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis, particularly those that
              consider the collective influence of genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions on complex traits. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules, advancing our understanding of the complex

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
              their roles, and gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating
              their influence on complex traits. This knowledge is vital for
              developing novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases
              exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types. Moreover, our approach demonstrates high
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally critical
              elements lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of
              co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic
              associations and highlights potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This novel framework provided by
              PhenoPLIER facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a crucial
              gap exists in our understanding of how genes act in concert to
              influence complex traits and disease etiology. While it is known
              that genes function in specific contexts through expression
              regulation, current approaches often overlook the importance of
              gene co-expression across different conditions, which is critical
              for developing new therapies and repurposing existing drugs. In
              this study, we introduce a novel method, PhenoPLIER, that
              addresses this gap by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
              to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. By analyzing diseases'
              significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate the power of
              PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation,
              where functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
              findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, providing new insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, and paving the way for more effective therapeutic
              target identification and drug repurposing strategies.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              function in concert with one another within specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for
              developing effective therapies. However, a gap exists in our
              current knowledge regarding how to accurately associate diseases
              with relevant gene modules expressed in particular cell types. In
              this study, we address this gap by presenting a novel approach
              that combines the use of PhenoPLIER, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, and an analysis of functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              Our results demonstrate that this method is successful in

              In specific contexts, genes function cooperatively to execute
              their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these
              genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing
              novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types,
              and our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation uncovers functionally
              important players lacking associations but prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
              integration of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization
              of genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              The development of effective therapies for complex diseases relies
              on a comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert to
              influence these conditions. Existing research has shown that the
              regulation of gene expression across different contexts is
              critical for uncovering the relationship between genes and complex
              traits. However, there is a gap in our knowledge regarding the
              identification of functionally important players that lack direct
              genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules. Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Specifically, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation,
              we find that functionally important players lacking genetic
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By filling this gap, our research highlights the
              broader significance of incorporating gene expression patterns in
              genetic studies and provides insights into therapeutic targets and
              drug repurposing for complex traits.

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              function in concert with one another in specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. However, a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions is necessary to
              determine how these genes contribute to diseases. This knowledge
              is critical for developing new therapies. The current study aimed
              to fill the gap in the literature regarding the incorporation of
              co-expressed gene groups in the interpretation of genetic
              associations and the identification of potential targets. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that
              utilizes gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to
              associate diseases with genes. Our approach was successful in
              accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

              In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition
              that understanding how genes act in concert with each other in
              specific contexts is critical for uncovering the mechanisms
              underlying complex traits and developing new therapies. However, a
              gap remains in our ability to accurately associate diseases with
              relevant gene modules and predict drug-disease pairs based on gene
              expression patterns. Here, we present a novel approach,
              PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of
              our method in associating diseases with relevant gene modules and
              predicting known drug-disease pairs, as well as its ability to
              infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show that functionally
              important players lacking individual gene associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results
              highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to provide a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules and shed light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
              ultimately contributing to the advancement of functional genomics
              and therapeutic target discovery.

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes
              function in concert with one another in specific contexts to
              influence complex traits. However, a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions is necessary to
              determine how these genes impact such traits, and this knowledge
              is critical for developing new therapies. Despite the importance
              of this issue, there is a gap in the current literature regarding
              the integration of co-expressed gene groups in the interpretation
              of genetic associations. In this study, we address this gap by
              demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach, which
              involves using PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation through a
              CRISPR screen, proves accurate in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, revealing
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our results suggest that PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby contextualizing genetic associations and

              In specific contexts, genes function cooperatively to execute
              their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these
              genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing
              novel therapies. Our study reveals a significant association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups can
              contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel

              In the field of functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding
              of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open
              question. While it is recognized that genes often act in concert
              with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions,
              determining the precise mechanisms by which these genes contribute
              to disease susceptibility and drug response requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. Currently, most genetic studies focus on single-gene
              associations, which may overlook important functional
              relationships between genes. Here, we present a novel approach
              called PhenoPLIER that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes
              to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness
              of this method by showing that diseases are significantly

              regarding the specific impact of gene modules on diseases and
              their associated mechanisms of action. This study aimed to address
              this gap by investigating the relationship between gene modules
              and diseases, as well as inferring potential drug targets and
              mechanisms of action. Our novel approach involves utilizing CRISPR
              screens to analyze lipid regulation and employing PhenoPLIER to
              contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene
              groups. The results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and prioritizing functionally important players lacking
              direct associations. By incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER
              reveals potential targets missed by traditional single-gene
              strategies, providing a valuable framework for interpreting
              genetic associations in the context of complex trait regulation.
              This research not only fills a critical gap in the current
              literature but also offers new insights and tools for developing
              targeted therapies in the broader field of genetics.

              Genes operate in coordination with one another within specific
              contexts to execute their functions, and an in-depth comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial to
              elucidate their influence on complex traits. This understanding is
              vital for the development of novel therapies. Our study reveals
              that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method proves effective
              in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation,
              we discover that functionally important genes, which lack direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed
              gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations
              and uncovers potential targets that might have been overlooked
              using single-gene strategies. This study introduces PhenoPLIER as
              a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting its potential in
              disease etiology and drug mechanism elucidation, therapeutic

              In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition
              that genes function in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across different conditions is critical
              for bridging the gap between genetic associations and functional
              genomics. However, current approaches often overlook the
              importance of gene co-expression and may fail to identify crucial
              players in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we
              introduce a novel method, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene

              In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes work
              in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions is crucial for elucidating
              how these genes influence complex traits and developing new
              therapies. However, a gap exists in the current literature
              regarding the integration of gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types for the analysis of diseases and drug-disease pairs.
              Here, we present a novel approach that utilizes PhenoPLIER to
              incorporate groups of co-expressed genes, thereby contextualizing
              genetic associations and revealing potential targets that may have
              been missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate

              Genes operate cooperatively within specific contexts to execute
              their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions for deciphering
              their influence on complex traits. Such knowledge is critical for
              the development of novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, the architecture of complex traits
              implies that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
              disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on gene
              modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis
              of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes,
              which lack individual associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a
              comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert with each
              other to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating
              disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              uncovering individual gene-trait associations, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the
              origin and progression of diseases. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across various conditions.


              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
              important players lacking individual gene-trait associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              highlights the potential of our approach for drug repurposing and
              uncovering novel therapeutic targets in complex traits. Overall,
              PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for integrating gene
              expression patterns with genetic association studies, thereby
              shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits and diseases is a critical yet unresolved
              issue. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid
              regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally
              important players lacking individual associations are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition of
              the importance of understanding how genes act in concert with each
              other to influence complex traits, particularly in the context of
              disease etiology and therapy development. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. However, current methods for mapping
              gene-trait associations do not take into account the complex
              interplay between genes and their regulation across different
              conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types and that our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of PhenoPLIER by
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and finding that
              functionally important players lacking individual gene
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
              findings underscore the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions in genetic studies and provide a powerful new tool
              for functional genomics, therapeutic target identification, and

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing effective
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been

              of genes with similar expression patterns across various
              conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
              applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation
              and discovered that functionally important players lacking
              individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by our approach. This research highlights
              the potential of functional genomics and gene co-expression
              analysis in uncovering novel therapeutic targets and facilitating
              drug repurposing for complex traits.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease origin and

              these interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

              Genes operate in collaboration with each other within specific
              contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across various conditions
              is essential for deciphering how these genes influence complex
              traits, which is critical for the development of novel therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern architectural models of
              complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, an analysis of a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally
              important genes lacking associations can be prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, our approach
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the
              projection of genetic associations using gene expression patterns,
              enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and
              facilitating drug repurposing.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits is critical for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful
              in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant role in disease origin and progression. However,
              current methods are limited in their ability to accurately map
              gene-trait associations and identify gene-gene interactions. Here,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally
              important players lacking individual gene associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results
              provide new insights into the role of gene-gene interactions in
              complex traits and highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool
              for drug discovery and development.

              Genes operate in coordination with each other within specific
              contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across various conditions
              is essential for deciphering how these genes influence complex
              traits, which is critical for the development of novel therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results
              indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking

              In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of
              how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful

              associations do not account for this. Here we introduce

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
