          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in
          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen
          to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct
          associations yet playing functional roles are identified within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
          offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene expression modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Here we
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated
          gene modules, predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to disease by integrating co-expression
          networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach offers a powerful
          framework for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug
          mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the
          clustering of complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in
          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen
          to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct
          associations yet playing functional roles are identified within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
          offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene expression modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Here we
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated
          gene modules, predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to disease by integrating co-expression
          networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach offers a powerful
          framework for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug
          mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the
          clustering of complex traits.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in
          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen
          to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct
          associations yet playing functional roles are identified within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
          offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene expression modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Here we
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated
          gene modules, predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to disease by integrating co-expression
          networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach offers a powerful
          framework for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug
          mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the
          clustering of complex traits.

          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen
          to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct
          associations yet playing functional roles are identified within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
          offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene expression modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Here we
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated
          gene modules, predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to disease by integrating co-expression
          networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach offers a powerful
          framework for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug
          mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the
          clustering of complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Here we
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated
          gene modules, predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to disease by integrating co-expression
          networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach offers a powerful
          framework for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug
          mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the
          clustering of complex traits.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression patterns
          under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated
          modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are
          functionally significant.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for
          interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
          discovery.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering
          gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
          associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
          novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the clustering
          of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of disease mechanisms
          and drug discovery.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression patterns
          under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated
          modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are
          functionally significant.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for
          interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
          discovery.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering
          gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
          associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
          novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the clustering
          of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of disease mechanisms
          and drug discovery.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression patterns
          under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated
          modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are
          functionally significant.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for
          interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
          discovery.

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering
          gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
          associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
          novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the clustering
          of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of disease mechanisms
          and drug discovery.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression patterns
          under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated
          modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are
          functionally significant.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for
          interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
          discovery.

          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering
          gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
          associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
          novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the clustering
          of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of disease mechanisms
          and drug discovery.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression patterns
          under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated
          modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are
          functionally significant.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for
          interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
          discovery.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological

          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing

          associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
          novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the clustering

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process pivotal to the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that
          certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
          associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our
          analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
          concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the interpretation
          of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This
          innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new perspective for
          dissecting genetic associations by considering the collective behavior
          of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective influence on
          complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet
          a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
          therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a
          robust framework that contextualizes genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach
          promises to refine the clustering of complex traits and accelerate the
          identification of therapeutic targets.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process pivotal to the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that
          certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
          associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our
          analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
          concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the interpretation
          of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This
          innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new perspective for
          dissecting genetic associations by considering the collective behavior
          of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective influence on
          complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet
          a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
          therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a
          robust framework that contextualizes genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach
          promises to refine the clustering of complex traits and accelerate the
          identification of therapeutic targets.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process pivotal to the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that
          certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
          associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our
          analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
          concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the interpretation
          of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This
          innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new perspective for
          dissecting genetic associations by considering the collective behavior
          of gene modules.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective influence on
          complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet
          a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
          therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a
          robust framework that contextualizes genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach
          promises to refine the clustering of complex traits and accelerate the
          identification of therapeutic targets.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process pivotal to the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that
          certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
          associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our
          analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
          concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the interpretation
          of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This
          innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new perspective for
          dissecting genetic associations by considering the collective behavior
          of gene modules.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective influence on
          complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet
          a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
          therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a
          robust framework that contextualizes genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach
          promises to refine the clustering of complex traits and accelerate the
          identification of therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process pivotal to the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that
          certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
          associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our
          analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
          concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the interpretation
          of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This
          innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new perspective for
          dissecting genetic associations by considering the collective behavior
          of gene modules.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective influence on
          complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet
          a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
          therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a
          robust framework that contextualizes genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach
          promises to refine the clustering of complex traits and accelerate the
          identification of therapeutic targets.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between disease states and
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate
          the method's precision in identifying known drug-disease relationships
          and inferring drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that traditional association studies
          overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the
          molecular underpinnings of diseases but also offers a powerful tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing,

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between disease states and
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate
          the method's precision in identifying known drug-disease relationships
          and inferring drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that traditional association studies
          overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the
          molecular underpinnings of diseases but also offers a powerful tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing,
          thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
          medicine.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between disease states and
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate
          the method's precision in identifying known drug-disease relationships
          and inferring drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that traditional association studies
          overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the
          molecular underpinnings of diseases but also offers a powerful tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing,
          thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
          medicine.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene

          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between disease states and
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate
          the method's precision in identifying known drug-disease relationships
          and inferring drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that traditional association studies
          overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the
          molecular underpinnings of diseases but also offers a powerful tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing,
          thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
          medicine.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules
              of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet playing
              functional roles are identified within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages
              gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a
              common latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological data. Here we demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules,
              predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers mechanisms
              of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated
              in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic contributions to disease by integrating
              co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach
              offers a powerful framework for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel drug mechanisms, with broad implications
              for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules
              of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet playing
              functional roles are identified within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules
              of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet playing
              functional roles are identified within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages
              gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a
              common latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological data. Here we demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules,
              predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers mechanisms
              of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated
              in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic contributions to disease by integrating
              co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach
              offers a powerful framework for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel drug mechanisms, with broad implications
              for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages
              gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a
              common latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological data. Here we demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules,
              predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers mechanisms
              of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated
              in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic contributions to disease by integrating
              co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach
              offers a powerful framework for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel drug mechanisms, with broad implications
              for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules
              of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet playing
              functional roles are identified within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
              modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression
              patterns under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a
              significant correlation between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. The methodology demonstrates
              precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER
              effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes
              that lack direct associations but are functionally significant.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic data
              through the prism of gene expression modules, providing valuable
              insights into disease etiology and drug discovery.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified
              latent space for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of
              co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms of action.
              Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering gene
              modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
              genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
              associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
              novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the
              clustering of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of
              disease mechanisms and drug discovery.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified
              latent space for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of
              co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms of action.
              Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering gene
              modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
              genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
              associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
              novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the
              clustering of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of
              disease mechanisms and drug discovery.

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
              modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression
              patterns under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a
              significant correlation between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. The methodology demonstrates
              precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER
              effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes
              that lack direct associations but are functionally significant.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic data
              through the prism of gene expression modules, providing valuable
              insights into disease etiology and drug discovery.

            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
              modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression
              patterns under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a
              significant correlation between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. The methodology demonstrates
              precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER
              effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes
              that lack direct associations but are functionally significant.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic data
              through the prism of gene expression modules, providing valuable
              insights into disease etiology and drug discovery.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified
              latent space for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of
              co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms of action.
              Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering gene
              modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
              genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
              associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
              novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the
              clustering of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of
              disease mechanisms and drug discovery.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified
              latent space for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of
              co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms of action.
              Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of considering gene
              modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
              genetic contributions to complex traits by contextualizing genetic
              associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
              novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the
              clustering of complex traits, offering a more nuanced view of
              disease mechanisms and drug discovery.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process
              pivotal to the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our
              study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in
              pertinent cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology
              exhibits proficiency in accurately predicting established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based
              investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain
              genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by
              our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages
              the concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the
              interpretation of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
              approaches. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new
              perspective for dissecting genetic associations by considering the
              collective behavior of gene modules.

              Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective
              influence on complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic
              strategies, yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this

              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within

            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study
            show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
            PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
            provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
            through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process
              pivotal to the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our
              study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in
              pertinent cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology
              exhibits proficiency in accurately predicting established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based
              investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain
              genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by
              our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages
              the concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the
              interpretation of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
              approaches. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new
              perspective for dissecting genetic associations by considering the
              collective behavior of gene modules.

              Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective
              influence on complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic
              strategies, yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this
              relationship remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to
              identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within
              the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              offering insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene
              analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals
              that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that
              lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
              providing a robust framework that contextualizes genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, thereby enhancing
              our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing efforts. This approach promises to refine the
              clustering of complex traits and accelerate the identification of
              therapeutic targets.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective
              influence on complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic
              strategies, yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this
              relationship remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to
              identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within
              the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              offering insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene
              analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals
              that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that
              lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
              providing a robust framework that contextualizes genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, thereby enhancing
              our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing efforts. This approach promises to refine the
              clustering of complex traits and accelerate the identification of
              therapeutic targets.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process
              pivotal to the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our
              study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in
              pertinent cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology
              exhibits proficiency in accurately predicting established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based
              investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain
              genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by
              our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages
              the concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the
              interpretation of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
              approaches. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new
              perspective for dissecting genetic associations by considering the
              collective behavior of gene modules.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process
              pivotal to the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our
              study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in
              pertinent cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology
              exhibits proficiency in accurately predicting established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based
              investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain
              genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by
              our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages
              the concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the
              interpretation of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
              approaches. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new
              perspective for dissecting genetic associations by considering the
              collective behavior of gene modules.

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens

              Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective
              influence on complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic
              strategies, yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this
              relationship remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to
              identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations within
              the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              offering insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene
              analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals
              that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that
              lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
              providing a robust framework that contextualizes genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, thereby enhancing
              our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing efforts. This approach promises to refine the
              clustering of complex traits and accelerate the identification of
              therapeutic targets.

              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that

              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed
              upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions.
              Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly
              linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be critical
              and are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by
              PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
              targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed
              upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions.
              Our findings reveal that disease associations are significantly
              linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be critical
              and are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by
              PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
              targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of

              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
