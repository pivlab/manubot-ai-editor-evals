This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00) Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.</td>

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We have observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is a need for a computational approach that can map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that addresses this gap by identifying gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions. This approach allows for a mechanistic understanding of gene influence on complex traits, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Our analysis shows that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a detailed understanding of how their expression is regulated across different conditions.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a detailed understanding of how their expression is regulated across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false
