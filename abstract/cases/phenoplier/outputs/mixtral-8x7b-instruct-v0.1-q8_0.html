 In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach has implications for both drug repurposing and the identification of new therapeutic targets in functional genomics.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

 Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is critical for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression.

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is critical for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression.

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is vital for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is essential for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits emphasize the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression.

The foundation of PhenoPLIER lies in the construction of gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important genes lacking individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER's innovative approach, which incorporates co-expressed gene groups, enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. By offering a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, with potential implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.">[FAIL] (0.73) Python code returned false

 Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles, and a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits. This insight is vital in developing novel therapeutic strategies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, an analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This method is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which allows for the examination of diseases in the context of relevant cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and furthermore, it prioritizes functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are present in trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER for facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities through a functional genomics lens, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms.

 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of complex traits and developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Interestingly, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations can be prioritized as members of trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.

 The interplay of genes in specific contexts to carry out their functions is crucial for understanding the influence of these genes on complex traits, particularly in the context of disease mechanisms and therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant processes, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding the impact of gene-gene interactions on disease origin and progression. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions to reveal significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct gene-trait associations. This research not only advances our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits but also highlights the potential for repurposing drugs by identifying novel therapeutic targets.">[FAIL] (0.91) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"
