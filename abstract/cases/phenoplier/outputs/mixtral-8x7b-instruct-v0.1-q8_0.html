 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that might have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, facilitating joint analysis. Genes function as part of complex networks, exerting their effects in specific contexts through intricate regulation of expression across various conditions. This mechanistic understanding is critical for elucidating the role of gene-gene interactions in the etiology and progression of complex traits, thereby paving the way for therapeutic advancements. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, the intricate interplay among these genes remains largely unexplored. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across analogous conditions, PhenoPLIER demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The method exhibits robust performance in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, devoid of individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules represents a valuable resource for functional genomics research, drug repurposing, and therapeutic target identification.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in the context of complex networks, where they collaborate with other genes to execute specific roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits and disease etiology, which is critical for developing effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern genetic studies suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact trait architecture, contributing to both disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER employs a representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules, highlighting the importance of understanding the functional context of gene expression in specific cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, showcasing its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.

Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen aimed at analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes, which might otherwise be overlooked due to lack of individual gene-trait associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of functional genomics and reveals potential targets that may be missed by conventional single-gene strategies.

 In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a major gap exists in our understanding of how gene-gene interactions contribute to complex traits and disease etiology. Current transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they fail to capture the intricate interplay among genes that is critical for a comprehensive view of disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and furthermore, it reveals functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for identifying novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, ultimately advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.91) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

Here, we introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and insights into mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, our method highlights potential targets overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies, thereby providing a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing drug repurposing efforts.">[PASS] (1.00)  The role of genes in the regulation of complex traits and their influence on disease etiology is not yet fully understood, primarily due to the lack of comprehensive methods that consider gene expression patterns across different conditions.

 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is essential for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach relies on gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions as the basis of its representation. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies functionally important players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules.

Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules.

 Genes operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions. Such knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>
