          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits and is pivotal
          for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under
          consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we reveal that key functional genes, despite lacking
          direct associations, are identified within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed
          genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          approaches. This novel framework offers a comprehensive perspective
          for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
          expression modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for
          comprehensive analysis. This method identifies modules of co-expressed
          genes across various conditions, revealing significant associations
          with diseases in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate
          PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease relationships
          and inferring drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
          contributions to disease by integrating co-expression networks,
          thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
          analyses might overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, offering insights
          into the underlying mechanisms of disease and treatment.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains underexplored.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns and pharmacological data to uncover
          the genetic architecture of diseases. PhenoPLIER integrates these data
          into a unified latent space, revealing modules of co-expressed genes
          that correlate with disease states and drug responses. Our results
          demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we show that
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
          direct associations with traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
          our understanding of complex traits by highlighting the importance of
          gene co-expression networks, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug
          repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This
          approach has the potential to transform the landscape of genetic
          studies and functional genomics by facilitating the clustering of
          complex traits and the discovery of new drug mechanisms.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in
          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates
          potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR
          screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify key functional
          genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
          offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene expression modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying

          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
          infers mechanisms of action but also, through a CRISPR screen for

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under
          consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types. PhenoPLIER shows proficiency in identifying established
          drug-disease relationships and deducing mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we reveal that key functional genes, despite lacking
          direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique
          perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of
          gene expression modules.

          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in

          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating the joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data.
          PhenoPLIER utilizes co-expression modules to capture the coordinated
          activity of genes across various conditions, enhancing our ability to
          discern the cellular context of diseases. Our results demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
          deciphers mechanisms of action, with diseases showing significant
          associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Notably, PhenoPLIER identifies key regulatory genes that, despite
          lacking direct associations, are implicated in trait-associated
          modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
          contributions to complex traits by integrating co-expressed gene
          groups, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This novel framework offers a
          powerful tool for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
          drug mechanisms, propelling the field of functional genomics forward.

          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data.
          PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes, revealing that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules active in
          relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the method's accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease relationships and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER identifies key regulatory
          genes that lack direct associations with traits but are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as validated by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to complex traits by highlighting the importance
          of gene co-expression networks, offering a powerful tool for drug
          repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. This
          approach has the potential to refine the interpretation of genetic
          studies and accelerate the identification of mechanisms underlying
          disease and treatment.

          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill biological functions,
          and understanding their collective influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation under
          varying conditions—a crucial element for the advancement of novel
          therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex
          diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes
          exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our findings indicate a significant correlation between diseases and
          gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The method
          demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes within
          trait-associated modules, even when these genes do not exhibit direct
          associations.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a more
          comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
          approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic associations
          through the prism of gene expression modules, enhancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing
          efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that
          integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce

          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
          under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes
          trait-associated modules, even for genes that lack direct associations
          but are functionally significant.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This approach offers a novel paradigm for
          interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug
          repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases
          is crucial for advancing medical research, yet current approaches
          often overlook the intricate interplay of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, they fall short in
          capturing the collective influence of gene networks. To address this
          gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages
          gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and inform drug discovery. PhenoPLIER constructs a
          latent representation of gene modules, enabling the integration of
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data for comprehensive
          analysis. Our findings demonstrate that disease-associated gene
          modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, enhancing
          the prediction of known drug-disease relationships and uncovering drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER identifies key regulatory
          genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis,
          offering a novel perspective on genetic associations through the prism
          of gene expression networks. This approach not only refines our
          understanding of disease mechanisms but also opens new avenues for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing, thereby
          propelling the field of functional genomics forward.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding their collective influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation under
          varying conditions—a crucial element for the advancement of novel
          therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the genesis and progression of diseases.

          regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          significant genes within trait-associated modules, even when these
          genes do not exhibit direct associations.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends the limitations of single-gene
          approaches by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby
          providing a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations
          within the context of gene modules. This novel framework offers a
          refined perspective for interpreting genetic data, potentially
          uncovering therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing that
          might otherwise be overlooked.

          Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases

          suggest that the interplay between genes plays a pivotal role in
          disease etiology that is not fully captured by single-gene analyses.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the

          understanding of how gene co-expression influences complex traits

          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms by contextualizing genetic associations within
          gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets and
          opportunities for drug repurposing that may be overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. This framework offers a powerful tool for
          clustering complex traits and identifying novel targets for functional
          genomics research and therapeutic intervention.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing novel therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER leverages gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting
          coordinated expression patterns under similar conditions—to construct
          its latent representation. Our findings demonstrate that these gene
          modules, particularly when expressed in relevant cell types, show
          significant associations with diseases. The PhenoPLIER framework
          excels in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships
          and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER successfully
          prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
          associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of gene modules. This approach
          not only uncovers potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
          by conventional methods but also offers a comprehensive framework for
          understanding the genetic underpinnings of diseases and informing drug
          repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          modules to interpret genetic associations within the context of
          disease and pharmacological perturbations. PhenoPLIER constructs a
          latent representation based on gene expression patterns across various
          conditions, enabling the identification of gene modules associated
          with specific diseases and cell types. Our analysis demonstrates that
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
          deciphers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          significant genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the
          utility of our method in capturing important genetic contributors to
          traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
          integrating co-expressed gene clusters, thereby enhancing our
          understanding of genetic underpinnings in diseases and informing drug
          repurposing efforts. This novel framework offers a significant step
          forward in the clustering of complex traits and the identification of
          elusive therapeutic targets.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of
          complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from
          clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under
          identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that disease states are
          significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell
          types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately predicting established
          drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack
          direct associations yet are integral to trait-associated gene modules.
          In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the collective information of
          co-expressed gene groups to refine the interpretation of genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework
          offers a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that
          integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, underscoring its ability to identify
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework that enhances our understanding of
          genetic associations by contextualizing them within gene modules,
          thereby advancing the discovery of disease mechanisms and facilitating
          drug repurposing.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we
          discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations by integrating co-expression patterns, thereby enhancing
          our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing
          strategies.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive method to elucidate the mechanistic connections between
          gene expression patterns and disease etiology remains elusive. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that leverages gene
          co-expression to contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential therapeutic targets not evident through single-gene

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology exhibits
          precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that certain
          functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
          traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool,
          PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative
          framework for interpreting genetic associations, leveraging the
          concept of gene co-expression to uncover novel insights into disease
          etiology and inform drug repurposing strategies.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
          understanding how gene expression patterns underpin complex traits and
          influence disease etiology. While individual genes have been the focus
          of genetic studies, the collective action of gene networks in specific
          cellular contexts remains less explored, particularly in relation to
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages
          gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic basis of diseases
          and identify potential drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
          disease-associated gene modules, expressed in relevant cell types, are
          significantly correlated with complex traits. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
          surpassing traditional single-gene approaches. Notably, a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are
          central in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges
          the gap between genetic associations and functional genomics, offering
          a powerful tool for uncovering disease etiology and informing drug
          discovery. This approach has broader implications for clustering
          complex traits and identifying therapeutic targets, thereby advancing
          the field of drug repurposing.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
          genes that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to
          uncover therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
          providing a robust framework that contextualizes genetic associations
          through gene expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding
          of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing and development.
          This approach promises to refine the clustering of complex traits and
          accelerate the identification of therapeutic targets, propelling the
          field towards more precise and effective medical interventions.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology exhibits
          precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that certain
          functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
          traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool,
          PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative

          understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes
          lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends traditional single-gene
          strategies by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be
          overlooked. This advancement not only fills a critical gap in
          functional genomics but also holds promise for enhancing drug
          repurposing efforts and clustering complex traits for better
          understanding of disease mechanisms.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the
          innovation of novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression
          of complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed from clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease states are significantly correlated with gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can still be critical, as PhenoPLIER prioritizes them within
          trait-associated gene clusters.

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the complex interplay of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression remains
          less understood. This gap hinders the development of new therapies and
          the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to
          bridge genetic associations and pharmacological data, providing a
          unified framework for understanding complex traits. By mapping
          gene-trait associations and drug perturbations into a shared latent
          space, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across
          various conditions, revealing significant associations with diseases
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the method's accuracy
          in predicting known drug-disease relationships and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that key functional genes, despite lacking direct
          associations, are implicated in disease through our gene module
          analysis. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of the
          genetic architecture of complex traits and offers a powerful tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and opportunities for drug
          repurposing, thereby contributing to precision medicine and functional
          genomics.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          PhenoPLIER reveals modules of co-expressed genes that correspond to
          disease states and therapeutic responses. Our findings demonstrate
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and provides insights into drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that traditional association studies might overlook. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic underpinnings of
          complex diseases but also offers a powerful tool for identifying
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby
          advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
          constructs a latent space where diseases and drugs are mapped based on
          shared gene expression modules. Our results demonstrate that these
          modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell
          types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action. Notably, our
          approach also identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking
          direct associations with traits, are implicated in disease through
          their presence in trait-associated modules, as confirmed by a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a
          powerful framework for understanding disease etiology and identifying
          potential drug targets, thereby offering new avenues for therapeutic
          intervention and drug repurposing.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across diverse conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an
          innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed
          upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our
          findings reveal that disease associations are significantly linked to
          gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
          demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that genes
          lacking direct associations can be critical and are identified within
          trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its
          potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
          repurposing.

          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular

          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
          constructs a latent space where diseases correlate with gene modules
          expressed in pertinent cell types. Our results demonstrate the
          method's precision in confirming known drug-disease relationships and
          revealing drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER effectively
          prioritizes functionally significant genes that traditional
          association studies overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds
          light on the molecular underpinnings of diseases but also opens
          avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the fields of functional
          genomics and precision medicine.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits and is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the

              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules

              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates
              potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that key
              functional genes, despite lacking direct associations, are
              identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. This novel framework offers a comprehensive
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide

              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we

              Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that

              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters
              of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations
              yet functionally significant are identified within
              trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This
              innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains underexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression
              patterns and pharmacological data to uncover the genetic
              architecture of diseases. PhenoPLIER integrates these data into a
              unified latent space, revealing modules of co-expressed genes that
              correlate with disease states and drug responses. Our results
              demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
              functionally important genes that lack direct associations with
              traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
              complex traits by highlighting the importance of gene
              co-expression networks, thereby offering a powerful tool for drug
              repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.
              This approach has the potential to transform the landscape of
              genetic studies and functional genomics by facilitating the
              clustering of complex traits and the discovery of new drug
              mechanisms.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we
              developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to project genetic associations and
              pharmacological data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes
              across various conditions, revealing significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated
              in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
              our understanding of genetic contributions to disease by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This
              novel framework offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and
              the discovery of drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the
              advancement of functional genomics and precision medicine.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
              with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              shows proficiency in identifying established drug-disease
              relationships and deducing mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that key functional genes, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers
              a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
              the prism of gene expression modules.

              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
              with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and
              elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that certain functionally critical genes, despite lacking
              direct associations, are identified within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters
              of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers
              a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
              the prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a common
              latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological data. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules
              of co-expressed genes, revealing that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules active in relevant cell types. Our
              results demonstrate the method's accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease relationships and inferring drug mechanisms of
              action. Notably, PhenoPLIER identifies key regulatory genes that
              lack direct associations with traits but are implicated in
              trait-associated modules, as validated by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits by
              highlighting the importance of gene co-expression networks,
              offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the discovery of
              novel therapeutic targets. This approach has the potential to
              refine the interpretation of genetic studies and accelerate the
              identification of mechanisms underlying disease and treatment.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              biological functions, and understanding their collective influence
              on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression
              regulation under varying conditions—a crucial element for the
              advancement of novel therapeutic interventions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms,
              contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of
              genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings indicate a significant correlation
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
              types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes within trait-associated modules, even when these
              genes do not exhibit direct associations.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a
              more comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked.
              This approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules,
              enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
              modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
              under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
              correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types. The method demonstrates precision in
              identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER
              effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes
              that lack direct associations but are functionally significant.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic data
              through the prism of gene expression modules, providing insights
              into disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

              Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and
              diseases is crucial for advancing medical research, yet current
              approaches often overlook the intricate interplay of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes, they fall short in capturing the collective influence of
              gene networks. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex traits and inform
              drug discovery. PhenoPLIER constructs a latent representation of
              gene modules, enabling the integration of gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological data for comprehensive analysis. Our findings
              demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly
              expressed in relevant cell types, enhancing the prediction of
              known drug-disease relationships and uncovering drug mechanisms of
              action. Notably, PhenoPLIER identifies key regulatory genes that,
              despite lacking direct associations, are implicated in
              trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene
              analysis, offering a novel perspective on genetic associations
              through the prism of gene expression networks. This approach not
              only refines our understanding of disease mechanisms but also
              opens new avenues for therapeutic target identification and drug
              repurposing, thereby propelling the field of functional genomics
              forward.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined

              influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of
              expression regulation under varying conditions—a crucial element
              for the advancement of novel therapeutic interventions. While

              thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of genetic
              associations within the context of gene modules. This novel

              Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and
              diseases is crucial for the development of new therapies, yet
              current models suggest that the interplay between genes plays a
              pivotal role in disease etiology that is not fully captured by
              single-gene analyses. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the contributions of individual genes, there is
              a gap in our mechanistic understanding of how gene co-expression
              influences complex traits across different conditions. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges
              this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is constructed from modules of genes
              with coordinated expression patterns, which we find to be
              significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our
              results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms by contextualizing genetic
              associations within gene modules, thereby highlighting potential
              therapeutic targets and opportunities for drug repurposing that
              may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This framework offers
              a powerful tool for clustering complex traits and identifying
              novel targets for functional genomics research and therapeutic
              intervention.

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER leverages gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting
              coordinated expression patterns under similar conditions—to
              construct its latent representation. Our findings demonstrate that
              these gene modules, particularly when expressed in relevant cell
              types, show significant associations with diseases. The PhenoPLIER
              framework excels in accurately predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that
              PhenoPLIER successfully prioritizes functionally significant genes
              that lack direct associations but are implicated in
              trait-associated modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability
              to interpret genetic associations within the context of gene
              modules. This approach not only uncovers potential therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by conventional methods but also
              offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the genetic
              underpinnings of diseases and informing drug repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression modules to interpret genetic
              associations within the context of disease and pharmacological
              perturbations. PhenoPLIER constructs a latent representation based
              on gene expression patterns across various conditions, enabling
              the identification of gene modules associated with specific
              diseases and cell types. Our analysis demonstrates that PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers
              mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the
              utility of our method in capturing important genetic contributors
              to traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene
              analysis by integrating co-expressed gene clusters, thereby
              enhancing our understanding of genetic underpinnings in diseases
              and informing drug repurposing efforts. This novel framework
              offers a significant step forward in the clustering of complex

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to

              interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of complex

              clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that disease states
              are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent

              significant genes that lack direct associations yet are integral

              the collective information of co-expressed gene groups to refine
              the interpretation of genetic associations, thereby uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a powerful

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and
              their implications for disease progression remains elusive.
              Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations into a
              unified latent space for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs
              modules of co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms
              of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
              genes that lack direct associations, underscoring its ability to
              identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework that enhances
              our understanding of genetic associations by contextualizing them
              within gene modules, thereby advancing the discovery of disease
              mechanisms and facilitating drug repurposing.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we discovered that certain
              functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
              traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our
              tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers
              an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations by
              integrating co-expression patterns, thereby enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing
              strategies.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in

              yet a comprehensive method to elucidate the mechanistic

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid
              regulation analysis, we discovered that certain functionally
              critical genes, although not directly associated with traits, are
              highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool,
              PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers
              an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations,
              leveraging the concept of gene co-expression to uncover novel
              insights into disease etiology and inform drug repurposing
              strategies.

              In the realm of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
              understanding how gene expression patterns underpin complex traits
              and influence disease etiology. While individual genes have been
              the focus of genetic studies, the collective action of gene
              networks in specific cellular contexts remains less explored,
              particularly in relation to therapeutic target identification and
              drug repurposing. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to elucidate the genetic basis of diseases and identify potential
              drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease-associated
              gene modules, expressed in relevant cell types, are significantly
              correlated with complex traits. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              surpassing traditional single-gene approaches. Notably, a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can
              prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are central in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic
              associations and functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for
              uncovering disease etiology and informing drug discovery. This
              approach has broader implications for clustering complex traits
              and identifying therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field
              of drug repurposing.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid
              regulation analysis, we discovered that certain functionally
              critical genes, although not directly associated with traits, are
              highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool,
              PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers
              an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations by
              integrating co-expression patterns of gene clusters, thereby
              enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              discovery and repurposing efforts.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering
              insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses.
              Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
              providing a robust framework that contextualizes genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, thereby enhancing
              our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing and development. This approach promises to refine the
              clustering of complex traits and accelerate the identification of
              therapeutic targets, propelling the field towards more precise and
              effective medical interventions.

              pivotal for the innovation of novel therapeutics.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene

              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed from
              clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our
              findings reveal that disease states are significantly correlated
              with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
              relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can still be
              critical, as PhenoPLIER prioritizes them within trait-associated

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the
              role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the complex
              interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
              progression remains less understood. This gap hinders the
              development of new therapies and the repurposing of existing
              drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic
              associations and pharmacological data, providing a unified
              framework for understanding complex traits. By mapping gene-trait
              associations and drug perturbations into a shared latent space,
              PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various
              conditions, revealing significant associations with diseases in
              relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the method's accuracy
              in predicting known drug-disease relationships and inferring drug
              mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation highlighted that key functional genes, despite lacking
              direct associations, are implicated in disease through our gene
              module analysis. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and
              offers a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and
              opportunities for drug repurposing, thereby contributing to
              precision medicine and functional genomics.

              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed from
              clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our
              findings reveal that disease states are significantly linked to
              gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
              relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be
              critical, yet are identified within trait-associated gene clusters
              by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
              therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
              complex traits and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating
              gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
              constructs a latent space where diseases and drugs are mapped
              based on shared gene expression modules. Our results demonstrate
              that these modules are significantly associated with diseases in
              relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action.
              Notably, our approach also identifies key regulatory genes that,
              despite lacking direct associations with traits, are implicated in
              disease through their presence in trait-associated modules, as
              confirmed by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for understanding disease
              etiology and identifying potential drug targets, thereby offering
              new avenues for therapeutic intervention and drug repurposing.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an
              innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is
              constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that disease associations are
              significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell
              types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct
              associations can be critical and are identified within
              trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its
              potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
              repurposing.

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
              complex traits and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating
              gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
              constructs a latent space where diseases correlate with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our results demonstrate
              the method's precision in confirming known drug-disease
              relationships and revealing drugs' mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that
              PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes
              that traditional association studies overlook. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the molecular underpinnings of
              diseases but also opens avenues for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the
              fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
