          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under
          consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we reveal that certain functionally critical genes,
          despite lacking direct associations, are identified within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
          offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene expression modules.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains underexplored.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic associations and
          pharmacological data within a unified latent space. By analyzing
          modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, PhenoPLIER
          effectively associates diseases with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships, elucidating potential mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally significant genes that lack
          direct associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of genetic underpinnings in complex diseases by
          integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering therapeutic
          targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analyses. This framework
          holds promise for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
          drug mechanisms, offering a significant step forward in functional
          genomics.

          diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established
          drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
          lipid regulation, we identify functionally critical genes that,
          despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within
          trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework
          offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations
          through the prism of gene expression modules.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes
          across various conditions, revealing significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
          infers mechanisms of action but also, through a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation, highlights functionally important genes that lack
          direct associations yet are implicated in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
          contributions to disease by integrating co-expression networks,
          thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
          analyses might overlook. This novel framework offers a powerful tool
          for drug repurposing and the discovery of drug mechanisms, propelling
          the field of functional genomics forward.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains underexplored.
          Addressing this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic
          associations and pharmacological data within a unified latent space.
          Our method relies on the identification of gene modules with coherent
          expression profiles across various conditions, enabling a
          comprehensive analysis of gene-trait associations. We demonstrate that
          disease traits are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are
          implicated in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of genetic contributions to disease by highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression networks. This framework offers a
          powerful tool for uncovering disease etiology and informing drug
          repurposing efforts, thereby providing a foundation for the
          identification of novel therapeutic targets.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in
          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters of
          genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
          conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
          PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
          reveal that key functional genes, despite lacking direct associations,
          are highlighted within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER.
          In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.
          This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting
          genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns and pharmacological data to uncover
          the genetic architecture of diseases. PhenoPLIER integrates these data
          into a unified latent space, revealing modules of co-expressed genes
          that correspond to specific conditions. Our findings demonstrate that
          these gene modules are significantly associated with diseases in
          relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
          direct associations with traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
          our understanding of genetic associations by focusing on gene
          expression modules, offering a powerful tool for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach
          promises to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional
          genomics, thereby enhancing our ability to decipher complex trait
          clustering and inform drug discovery.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic associations
          and pharmacological data. PhenoPLIER employs a latent space
          representation based on co-expression modules, enabling a
          comprehensive analysis of gene-trait associations. Our results
          demonstrate that disease traits are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights
          that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
          direct associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of complex traits by integrating co-expressed gene
          groups, offering a powerful tool for uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets and facilitating drug repurposing. This novel framework
          promises to refine the interpretation of genetic studies and catalyze
          the discovery of drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the
          advancement of functional genomics and precision medicine.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
          under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes trait-associated modules,
          identifying key functional components that traditional association
          studies overlook.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise remain undetected. This approach offers a novel paradigm
          for interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Our
          method hinges on the identification of gene modules with coherent
          expression profiles across various conditions, which are then
          correlated with disease phenotypes and drug responses. We demonstrate
          that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and deciphers mechanisms of action, with significant associations
          observed between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in capturing
          key players in trait manifestation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
          our understanding of genetic underpinnings in complex diseases by
          contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
          illuminating potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses
          may overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing
          and the clustering of complex traits, offering a fresh perspective on
          the intricate landscape of gene function and disease.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational strategy that integrates
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes collaborate within
          specific contexts to execute their biological roles, and understanding
          the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions
          is essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
          new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of complex
          diseases.


          PhenoPLIER leverages gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting
          coordinated expression patterns under similar conditions—to construct
          its latent representation. We demonstrate that these gene modules are
          significantly correlated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our
          method shows high accuracy in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER successfully prioritizes functionally significant genes
          that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated
          modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by harnessing
          the collective power of co-expressed gene groups, thereby enhancing
          our ability to interpret genetic associations and uncover potential
          therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This framework
          offers a transformative perspective for the analysis of genetic data
          through the prism of gene expression modules, with implications for
          disease understanding and drug discovery.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the quest to understand the genetic underpinnings of complex
          diseases, current research has illuminated the role of individual
          genes but often overlooks the significance of gene-gene interactions.
          Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
          comprehensive model that integrates these interactions to elucidate
          disease etiology and inform drug development remains elusive.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent
          space for joint analysis. Our method reveals that disease traits are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, enhancing the prediction of known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER identifies
          key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are
          implicated in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends
          single-gene analysis by integrating co-expressed gene clusters,
          thereby refining our understanding of genetic contributions to disease
          and uncovering novel therapeutic targets. This framework offers a new
          perspective for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic
          targets, advancing the field of functional genomics and the clustering
          of complex traits.

          latent representation from clusters of genes exhibiting coherent

          demonstrate that disease states are significantly correlated with gene

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that
          integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic underpinnings of diseases by contextualizing genetic
          associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
          novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the clustering
          of complex traits, offering a new perspective on the intricate
          mechanisms driving disease and treatment responses.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the
          genesis and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its
          latent representation from clusters of genes exhibiting coherent
          expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally critical genes that lack direct associations within
          trait-associated gene modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
          collective information of co-expressed gene groups to contextualize
          genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework
          offers a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

          Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases
          is crucial for the development of new therapies, yet current
          approaches often overlook the role of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

          they fall short in capturing the intricate interplay between genes. To

          PhenoPLIER constructs a latent representation based on gene modules
          with coordinated expression across various conditions, enabling a

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing novel therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation by identifying modules
          of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical
          conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The
          accuracy of PhenoPLIER is evident in its ability to predict
          established drug-disease relationships and deduce mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes
          that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated
          gene modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a more
          comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
          framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic
          associations through the prism of gene expression modules, enhancing
          our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing
          efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This method leverages
          modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling a
          mechanistic insight into gene function in relation to complex traits.
          Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, with diseases
          showing significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that
          lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in
          identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
          thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing
          drug repurposing and development.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we
          discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in prioritizing potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations by integrating co-expression patterns, thereby enhancing
          our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and
          repurposing efforts.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, as evidenced by our CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation, which highlights functionally important genes that
          lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic
          associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes but also
          unveils potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may
          overlook. This framework propels the field of functional genomics
          forward by providing a more nuanced understanding of gene regulation
          in disease and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology exhibits
          precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and
          deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through
          a CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that genes of
          functional significance, despite lacking direct associations, are
          highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER.
          This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
          approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for
          the interpretation of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of

          In the realm of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
          understanding how gene expression patterns underpin complex traits and
          influence disease etiology, which is essential for identifying
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. While
          individual genes have been the focus of genetic studies, the
          collective action of gene modules in specific cellular contexts
          remains underexplored. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns to
          elucidate the genetic basis of diseases and predict drug mechanisms.
          Our study demonstrates that disease-associated gene modules, expressed
          in relevant cell types, are significantly correlated with complex
          traits. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action, as evidenced by our CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, which highlights functionally important
          genes that lack direct associations yet are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          ability to interpret genetic associations beyond single-gene analyses,
          offering a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          conventional methods. This approach has broad implications for the
          clustering of complex traits and the identification of novel drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression
          modules to provide insights into disease etiology and inform drug
          discovery and repurposing efforts.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, as evidenced by our CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation, which identifies crucial yet previously unassociated
          players within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          transcends traditional single-gene strategies by integrating groups of
          co-expressed genes, thereby enhancing our understanding of genetic
          contributions to disease and informing the identification of
          therapeutic targets. This advancement has broad implications for
          functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits, offering a
          powerful tool for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel
          therapeutic avenues.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening
          focused on lipid regulation, we discovered that certain genes of
          functional significance, despite lacking direct associations, are
          highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our analytical tool,
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene
          co-expression networks to interpret genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework provided by
          PhenoPLIER offers a refined perspective for understanding genetic
          links in the context of gene expression patterns, enhancing the
          identification of disease etiologies and informing drug repurposing
          efforts.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to
          interpret genetic associations with diseases. Our study demonstrates
          that disease etiologies are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights
          into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Notably, our CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally
          important genes lack direct associations, they are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules, underscoring the utility of our method. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
          contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
          highlighting disease etiology and uncovering therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene analysis. This framework has broad
          implications for enhancing our understanding of complex traits and
          facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          genetic underpinnings of complex traits and is pivotal for the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. In this study, we
          demonstrate that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with
          gene modules that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular
          environments. Our methodology exhibits high precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening
          focused on lipid metabolism, we discovered that genes of functional
          significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
          within trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER.
          This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional single-gene
          approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework
          for the interpretation of genetic associations, leveraging the concept
          of gene co-expression to uncover insights into disease etiology and
          inform drug repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease traits are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is
          achievable with single-gene analyses. For instance, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes,
          while not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in
          functional genomics by providing a robust method to project genetic
          associations onto gene expression patterns, thereby uncovering disease
          etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be
          overlooked by conventional methods. This framework has broad
          implications for enhancing our understanding of complex traits and
          streamlining drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

          influence of these genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the

          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to

          gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression
          of complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease states are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug action mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          models inadequately capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions
          in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they
          fall short in elucidating the collective influence of gene networks.
          To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
          data into a unified latent space, facilitating the analysis of
          co-expressed gene modules under various conditions. Our findings
          reveal that diseases correlate significantly with gene modules active
          in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships but also uncovers potential drug
          mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation highlighted that key regulatory genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are identified within relevant gene
          modules by our approach. This study not only enhances our
          understanding of disease pathogenesis but also opens new avenues for
          drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are markedly linked to gene clusters active in pertinent
          cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug action
          mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be
          critical and are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by
          PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of
          new therapies that could target these interactions. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex
          traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. By integrating
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
          constructs a latent space where gene modules with coherent expression
          profiles are associated with diseases and drug responses. Our results
          demonstrate that disease traits are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes may
          not show direct associations, they are implicated in disease through
          their presence in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          not only sheds light on the underlying genetic factors of complex
          diseases but also offers a promising avenue for drug repurposing and
          the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the
          fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a
          significant correlation between diseases and gene clusters expressed
          in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          models lack a comprehensive view of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short in
          capturing the intricate gene co-expression networks that underpin
          complex trait architectures. To address this gap, we developed
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          facilitating the analysis of co-expressed gene modules under various
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules active in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also
          elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can
          prioritize key regulatory genes that traditional association studies
          overlook. This approach advances our understanding of disease etiology
          and opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of
          therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to the precision medicine
          paradigm.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of
          new therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex
          traits and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent
          space where diseases and drugs converge on shared gene expression
          modules, revealing cellular contexts pertinent to disease states. Our
          results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and infers drugs' mechanisms of action.
          Notably, it also identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking
          direct associations with traits, are implicated in disease-relevant
          pathways through their module membership. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a powerful framework for understanding disease etiology and
          identifying potential drug mechanisms, thereby offering a promising
          avenue for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic
          targets. This approach advances the field of functional genomics by
          clustering complex traits and illuminating the underlying molecular
          interactions that drive disease.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a process pivotal to the
          innovation of novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression
          of complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease states are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
          drug action mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical, yet are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex architecture of traits suggests that gene-gene interactions
          are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. This gap in knowledge
          underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to elucidate the
          interplay between gene expression and complex traits, particularly for
          the development of novel therapies. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations
          with pharmacological data into a unified latent space, facilitating
          the analysis of gene co-expression modules under various conditions.
          Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully
          identifies key regulatory genes in lipid metabolism that are not
          directly associated with traits but are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic
          underpinnings of complex diseases but also offers a powerful tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and opportunities for drug
          repurposing, thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and
          precision medicine.

              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
              with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and
              elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that certain functionally critical genes, despite lacking
              direct associations, are identified within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters
              of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
              offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations
              through the prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains underexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression
              patterns to bridge genetic associations and pharmacological data
              within a unified latent space. By analyzing modules of
              co-expressed genes across various conditions, PhenoPLIER
              effectively associates diseases with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships, elucidating potential mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights
              that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally significant genes that
              lack direct associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic underpinnings in complex diseases by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analyses. This
              framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel drug mechanisms, offering a significant
              step forward in functional genomics.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
              with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              proves effective in accurately predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, we discover that genes lacking direct associations yet
              functionally significant are identified within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters
              of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
              offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations
              through the prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to bridge genetic associations and
              pharmacological data within a unified latent space. Our method
              relies on the identification of gene modules with coherent
              expression profiles across various conditions, enabling a
              comprehensive analysis of gene-trait associations. We demonstrate
              that disease traits are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully
              prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as
              evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic contributions to
              disease by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression
              networks. This framework offers a powerful tool for uncovering
              disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts, thereby
              providing a foundation for the identification of novel therapeutic
              targets.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits and is
              critical for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules
              of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen
              to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that certain
              functionally critical genes, despite lacking direct associations,
              are highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. This novel framework offers a unique perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
              expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to bridge genetic associations and
              pharmacological data. PhenoPLIER employs a latent space
              representation based on co-expression modules, enabling a
              comprehensive analysis of gene-trait associations. Our results
              demonstrate that disease traits are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of complex traits by
              integrating co-expressed gene groups, offering a powerful tool for
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
              repurposing. This novel framework promises to refine the
              interpretation of genetic studies and catalyze the discovery of
              drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the advancement of
              functional genomics and precision medicine.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
              modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
              under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant
              correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in
              identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              drug mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              trait-associated modules, identifying key functional components
              that traditional association studies overlook.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise remain undetected. This
              approach offers a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic data
              through the prism of gene expression modules, providing valuable
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that

              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified
              latent space for joint analysis. Our method hinges on the
              identification of gene modules with coherent expression profiles
              across various conditions, which are then correlated with disease
              phenotypes and drug responses. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers
              mechanisms of action, with significant associations observed
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
              types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in
              capturing key players in trait manifestation. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings in
              complex diseases by contextualizing genetic associations within
              gene modules, thereby illuminating potential therapeutic targets
              that single-gene analyses may overlook. This novel framework holds
              promise for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits,
              offering a fresh perspective on the intricate landscape of gene
              function and disease.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational strategy that
              integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER leverages gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting
              coordinated expression patterns under similar conditions—to
              construct its latent representation. We demonstrate that these
              gene modules are significantly correlated with diseases in
              relevant cell types. Our method shows high accuracy in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER successfully prioritizes
              functionally significant genes that lack direct associations but
              are embedded in trait-associated modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              harnessing the collective power of co-expressed gene groups,
              thereby enhancing our ability to interpret genetic associations
              and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be
              overlooked. This framework offers a transformative perspective for
              the analysis of genetic data through the prism of gene expression
              modules, with implications for disease understanding and drug
              discovery.

              In the quest to understand the genetic underpinnings of complex
              diseases, current research has illuminated the role of individual
              genes but often overlooks the significance of gene-gene
              interactions. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association
              studies, a comprehensive model that integrates these interactions
              to elucidate disease etiology and inform drug development remains
              elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to project genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations
              into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Our method reveals
              that disease traits are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, enhancing the prediction of
              known drug-disease pairs and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Notably, PhenoPLIER identifies key regulatory genes that,
              despite lacking direct associations, are implicated in
              trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene
              analysis by integrating co-expressed gene clusters, thereby
              refining our understanding of genetic contributions to disease and
              uncovering novel therapeutic targets. This framework offers a new

              therapeutic targets, advancing the field of functional genomics

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal
              for elucidating complex trait etiologies and advancing therapeutic
              development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the genesis and progression of
              complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation
              from clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
              under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that disease
              states are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed
              in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately
              predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally critical genes that lack direct
              associations, underscoring its ability to identify potential
              targets that single-gene approaches may overlook. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages gene co-expression networks to contextualize
              genetic associations, thereby uncovering novel therapeutic targets
              and providing a comprehensive framework for interpreting genetic
              data through the prism of gene modules.

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important

              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and
              their implications for disease progression remains elusive.
              Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations into a
              unified latent space for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs
              modules of co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms
              of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
              genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by
              contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
              strategies may overlook. This novel framework holds promise for
              drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, offering a
              new perspective on the intricate mechanisms driving disease and
              treatment responses.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and
              diseases is crucial for the development of new therapies, yet
              current approaches often overlook the role of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual gene
              contributions to disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing
              the intricate interplay between genes. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
              complex traits and inform drug repurposing strategies. PhenoPLIER
              constructs a latent representation based on gene modules with
              coordinated expression across various conditions, enabling a joint

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation by identifying
              modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. The accuracy of PhenoPLIER is evident in its ability
              to predict established drug-disease relationships and deduce
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that lack direct associations but are embedded
              in trait-associated gene modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a
              more comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked.
              This framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules,
              enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges
              this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes
              across various conditions, enabling a mechanistic insight into
              gene function in relation to complex traits. Our findings
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action, with diseases showing
              significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed
              that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a
              powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              gene expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of
              disease etiology and informing drug repurposing and development.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that certain
              functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
              traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our
              tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              prioritizing potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers
              an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations by
              integrating co-expression patterns, thereby enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and

              drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as evidenced
              by our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, which
              highlights functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic
              associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes but
              also unveils potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
              strategies may overlook. This framework propels the field of
              functional genomics forward by providing a more nuanced
              understanding of gene regulation in disease and facilitating drug
              repurposing efforts.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid
              regulation analysis, we discovered that genes of functional
              significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
              within trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This
              underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
              approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework

              concept of gene co-expression to uncover insights into disease
              etiology and inform drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
              understanding how gene expression patterns underpin complex traits
              and influence disease etiology, which is essential for identifying
              therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. While
              individual genes have been the focus of genetic studies, the
              collective action of gene modules in specific cellular contexts
              remains underexplored. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to elucidate the genetic basis of diseases and predict drug
              mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease-associated gene
              modules, expressed in relevant cell types, are significantly
              correlated with complex traits. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts

              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              conventional methods. This approach has broad implications for the
              clustering of complex traits and the identification of novel drug
              repurposing opportunities.

              traditional single-gene strategies by integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes, thereby enhancing our understanding of genetic
              contributions to disease and informing the identification of
              therapeutic targets. This advancement has broad implications for
              functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits, offering
              a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel
              therapeutic avenues.

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection

              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in
              pertinent cellular environments. Our methodology exhibits
              precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              through a CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid regulation, we
              discovered that certain genes of functional significance, despite
              lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-related
              gene modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression networks to
              interpret genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
              approaches. This innovative framework provided by PhenoPLIER
              offers a refined perspective for understanding genetic links in
              the context of gene expression patterns, enhancing the
              identification of disease etiologies and informing drug
              repurposing efforts.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to interpret genetic associations with
              diseases. Our study demonstrates that disease etiologies are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights into
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Notably, our CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally
              important genes lack direct associations, they are prioritized
              within trait-associated modules, underscoring the utility of our
              method. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional
              genomics by contextualizing genetic associations within gene
              modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and uncovering
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet current models inadequately capture the complexity of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they fall short
              in elucidating the collective influence of gene networks. To
              address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              framework that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological data into a unified latent space, facilitating the
              analysis of co-expressed gene modules under various conditions.
              Our findings reveal that diseases correlate significantly with
              gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also
              uncovers potential drug mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation highlighted that key regulatory
              genes, although not directly associated with traits, are
              identified within relevant gene modules by our approach. This

              but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the
              identification of therapeutic targets.

              Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              leverages gene expression patterns to elucidate the genetic
              architecture of complex traits and identify potential therapeutic
              targets. By integrating gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where
              gene modules with coherent expression profiles are associated with
              diseases and drug responses. Our results demonstrate that disease
              traits are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and provides insights into drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes
              may not show direct associations, they are implicated in disease
              through their presence in trait-associated modules. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the underlying genetic factors
              of complex diseases but also offers a promising avenue for drug
              repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets,
              thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
              medicine.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet current models lack a comprehensive view of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual gene functions
              in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the intricate
              gene co-expression networks that underpin complex trait
              architectures. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait
              associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent
              space, facilitating the analysis of co-expressed gene modules

              relationships but also elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize key regulatory genes
              that traditional association studies overlook. This approach
              advances our understanding of disease etiology and opens new
              avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic
              targets, thereby contributing to the precision medicine paradigm.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              and progression remains underexplored. This gap hinders the
              development of new therapies and the repurposing of existing
              drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that leverages gene expression patterns to elucidate the genetic
              architecture of complex traits and identify therapeutic targets.
              By integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data,
              PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where diseases and drugs
              converge on shared gene expression modules, revealing cellular
              contexts pertinent to disease states. Our results demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
              and infers drugs' mechanisms of action. Notably, it also
              identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct
              associations with traits, are implicated in disease-relevant
              pathways through their module membership. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for understanding disease
              etiology and identifying potential drug mechanisms, thereby
              offering a promising avenue for drug repurposing and the discovery
              of novel therapeutic targets. This approach advances the field of
              functional genomics by clustering complex traits and illuminating
              the underlying molecular interactions that drive disease.

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal to the innovation of novel therapeutics.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              framework for combined analysis. This framework is constructed
              upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions.
              Our findings reveal that disease states are significantly linked
              to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating drug action mechanisms.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be
              critical, yet are identified within trait-associated gene clusters
              by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
              therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
