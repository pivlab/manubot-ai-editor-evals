          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits and is pivotal
          for the development of novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a
          CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify that genes
          lacking direct associations yet playing functional roles are
          highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize
          genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework
          offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations
          through the prism of gene expression modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations
          onto a shared latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Our method
          identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions,
          revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action but
          also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations yet are
          implicated in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          advances our understanding of genetic contributions to disease by
          integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This
          framework offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the
          identification of novel drug mechanisms, moving the field of
          functional genomics towards a more holistic understanding of complex
          traits.

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon modules of genes that exhibit coherent
          expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes, despite lacking
          direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new
          perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of
          gene expression modules.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating the analysis of
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations. By
          analyzing modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, we
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules active in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to complex traits by highlighting the importance
          of gene co-expression networks. This novel framework not only
          contextualizes genetic associations beyond single-gene analyses but
          also uncovers potential therapeutic targets, offering promising
          avenues for drug repurposing and the development of precision
          medicine.

          modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique

          gene expression modules.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic
          associations and pharmacological data. Here we demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER effectively maps these associations onto a latent space
          defined by gene co-expression modules, facilitating a joint analysis
          of gene function and drug effects. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation, we highlight that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
          contributions to complex traits by integrating co-expression patterns,
          thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
          analyses might overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug
          repurposing and the identification of novel drug mechanisms,
          potentially accelerating the development of targeted treatments.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
          cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed
          upon modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
          findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with
          gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates
          potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR
          screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that key functional
          genes, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic
          associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
          overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a
          refined perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
          prism of gene expression modules, enhancing our understanding of
          disease etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

          trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic contributions to complex traits by highlighting the importance
          of gene co-expression networks. This novel framework not only
          contextualizes genetic associations beyond single-gene analyses but
          also uncovers potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing and
          development, thereby offering a powerful tool for functional genomics
          and precision medicine.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This space is
          constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under consistent
          conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
          PhenoPLIER proves effective in accurately predicting established
          drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we reveal that certain functionally critical genes,
          despite lacking direct associations, are identified within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework
          offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations
          through the prism of gene expression modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating the analysis of

          crucial element for the innovation of new therapeutic interventions.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the genesis
          and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on
          the foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent expression
          patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate a
          significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          significant genes within trait-associated modules, even when these
          genes do not show direct associations. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic
          associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
          overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative method offers a
          fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
          prism of gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology
          and informing drug repurposing efforts.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Our
          method hinges on the identification of gene modules with coherent
          expression profiles across various conditions, which are then
          correlated with disease phenotypes and drug responses. We demonstrate
          that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and deciphers mechanisms of action, with significant associations
          observed between disease states and gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally critical genes that
          lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in
          capturing key players within trait-associated modules. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expressed
          gene clusters, thereby enhancing our understanding of genetic
          underpinnings in diseases and informing drug repurposing efforts. This
          novel framework promises to refine the interpretation of genetic
          studies and propel the discovery of therapeutic targets, potentially
          revolutionizing the clustering of complex traits for medical
          advancements.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait

          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex

          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease development remains inadequately explored.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation, enabling joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages gene
          co-expression modules that capture the coordinated activity of genes
          across various conditions, providing insights into the mechanistic
          underpinnings of complex traits. Our findings demonstrate that disease
          associations are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. The approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Notably, a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations, underscoring the utility of considering gene networks.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
          contributions to disease by highlighting the importance of gene
          co-expression patterns. This framework offers a powerful tool for drug
          repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, potentially
          transforming the landscape of precision medicine by moving beyond
          single-gene strategies.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding their collective influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation under
          varying conditions—a crucial element for the advancement of novel
          therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the genesis and progression of diseases.
          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules
          that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our findings indicate a significant correlation between diseases and
          gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The methodology
          demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating drugs' mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack
          direct associations within trait-associated modules. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER enhances the interpretation of genetic associations by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          approaches. This novel framework offers a transformative perspective
          for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
          modules, with implications for disease etiology and drug discovery.

          inferring drug mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are
          embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by
          contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies
          may overlook. This novel framework holds promise for drug repurposing
          and the clustering of complex traits, offering a new perspective on
          the molecular mechanisms driving disease and treatment responses.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.


          Revised paragraph:

      response:
        output: >-
          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing new therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes
          exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
          with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. The method shows
          proficiency in accurately predicting established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes within
          trait-associated modules, even when these genes do not exhibit direct
          associations.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a novel perspective
          for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
          modules, with implications for disease etiology and drug discovery,
          including drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and diseases
          is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          approaches often overlook the intricate interplay of gene-gene
          interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, they
          fall short in capturing the collective influence of gene networks.
          This gap hinders our ability to fully decipher disease etiology and
          identify potential drug targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent
          representation, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene
          co-expression modules. Our method leverages the coordinated expression
          of gene clusters across various conditions, revealing significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, identifies key regulatory genes
          that lack direct associations yet are implicated in trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
          associations within gene networks offers a powerful tool for
          elucidating disease etiology and uncovering therapeutic targets that
          may be missed by single-gene analyses. This framework holds promise
          for enhancing drug repurposing efforts and advancing our understanding
          of the genetic architecture of complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing new therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes
          exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
          with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. The accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER is evident in its ability to predict established
          drug-disease relationships and deduce mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
          associations but are embedded in trait-associated gene modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a novel perspective
          for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
          modules, with implications for disease etiology and drug discovery.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model that
          integrates gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression modules to interpret genetic associations within a
          unified latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbations. PhenoPLIER's framework
          is predicated on the clustering of genes with similar expression
          patterns across various conditions, which we demonstrate to be
          significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our
          results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are
          embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expression patterns,
          thereby enhancing our understanding of genetic contributions to
          disease and informing drug repurposing efforts. This approach not only
          sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of complex traits but also
          opens avenues for identifying novel therapeutic targets that may have
          been overlooked by conventional methods.

          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we
          discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations by integrating co-expression gene clusters, thereby
          enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
          repurposing strategies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease traits are
          significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is
          achievable with single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in
          functional genomics by providing a robust framework that
          contextualizes genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
          thereby highlighting overlooked therapeutic targets and facilitating
          drug repurposing. This advancement has the potential to transform our
          understanding of disease mechanisms and accelerate the discovery of
          effective treatments.

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive method to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of gene
          expression in disease etiology remains elusive. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to illuminate the genetic underpinnings of diseases and
          inform drug repurposing efforts. Our study demonstrates that disease
          associations are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action, as evidenced by
          our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, which identifies
          crucial yet previously unassociated genes within trait-linked modules.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends traditional single-gene analysis
          by integrating co-expressed gene clusters, thereby enhancing our
          ability to pinpoint therapeutic targets and refine our understanding
          of disease mechanisms. This framework represents a significant step
          forward in functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for
          clustering complex traits and identifying novel drug mechanisms.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid
          regulation, we discovered that genes lacking direct associations with
          traits are nonetheless highlighted as functionally significant within
          trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In
          summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
          provide context to genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
          approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for
          interpreting genetic associations via the prism of gene expression
          patterns.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We
          provide evidence that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can
          prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations
          but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by contextualizing
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby
          highlighting disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This framework has
          broad implications for enhancing our understanding of disease
          mechanisms and facilitating drug repurposing.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across diverse conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screen investigating lipid
          regulation, we discovered that certain functionally critical genes,
          although not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations by integrating co-expression patterns, thereby enhancing
          our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and
          repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          approaches often overlook the coordinated expression patterns that
          underlie disease mechanisms. This study addresses the gap by
          leveraging gene co-expression to elucidate the genetic basis of
          diseases and identify potential drug targets. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene
          expression profiles with genetic associations to identify
          disease-relevant gene modules and predict drug-disease relationships.
          Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, and it
          successfully highlights important genes that lack direct associations
          but are implicated in disease through module participation. By
          employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we further validate
          the significance of these trait-associated modules. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of disease etiology by
          contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
          uncovering therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might miss.
          This approach not only refines the interpretation of complex genetic
          data but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the
          identification of novel therapeutic targets.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
          therapeutic targets. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in
          functional genomics by providing a robust framework that
          contextualizes genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
          thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing
          drug repurposing efforts. This advancement promises to refine the
          clustering of complex traits and accelerate the identification of
          therapeutic targets.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed from clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be critical,
          yet are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by
          PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
          targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex architecture of traits suggests that gene-gene interactions
          are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. This gap in knowledge
          hinders the development of new therapies and the repurposing of

          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
          constructs a latent space where gene modules, indicative of
          co-expression across various conditions, are analyzed jointly. Our
          results demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are
          significantly expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only
          sheds light on the underlying genetic architecture of complex traits
          but also offers a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby advancing the fields of
          functional genomics and precision medicine.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed from clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are significantly linked to gene clusters expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be
          critical, yet are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by
          PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
          targets.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          PhenoPLIER reveals modules of co-expressed genes that correspond to
          disease states and therapeutic responses. Our results demonstrate
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can
          prioritize functionally important genes that traditional association
          studies overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on
          the molecular underpinnings of diseases but also offers a powerful
          tool for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
          repurposing, thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and
          precision medicine.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with drug perturbation data into a unified latent space,
          PhenoPLIER reveals modules of co-expressed genes that correspond to
          disease states and cellular contexts. Our results demonstrate
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and provides insights into drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes
          that traditional association studies might overlook. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic underpinnings of
          complex diseases but also offers a powerful tool for identifying
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby
          advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

          Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding their collective influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation
          under varying conditions—a critical factor in the development of novel
          therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is
          constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked
          to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
          demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that genes
          lacking direct associations can be critical and are identified within
          trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its
          potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
          repurposing.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex architecture of traits suggests that gene-gene interactions
          are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. This gap in knowledge
          hinders the development of new therapies and the repurposing of
          existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to elucidate the
          genetic basis of diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets.
          By integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data,
          PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where gene modules with coherent
          expression profiles are analyzed in conjunction with complex traits.
          Our results demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are
          significantly expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drug
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important genes that traditional association studies overlook. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic
          underpinnings of complex diseases but also offers a powerful tool for
          drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets,
          thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
          medicine.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, yet contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational
          methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed from clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene modules
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
          targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is pivotal for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          models inadequately capture the essence of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they
          fall short in elucidating the collective influence of gene networks.
          Addressing this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          framework that integrates gene-trait associations with drug
          perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating the
          simultaneous analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our findings
          reveal that these modules, which consist of genes with coordinated
          expression patterns, are significantly linked to diseases within
          relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships but also uncovers potential mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, by applying our approach to a CRISPR screen focused
          on lipid regulation, we demonstrate its ability to identify key
          regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are
          implicated in trait-associated modules. This work not only bridges a
          critical knowledge gap in functional genomics but also paves the way
          for identifying novel therapeutic targets and opportunities for drug
          repurposing, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait
          clustering and disease intervention.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits and is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapeutics.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules
              of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              effective in accurately predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, we identify that genes lacking direct associations yet
              playing functional roles are highlighted within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters
              of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers
              a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
              the prism of gene expression modules.

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in
              specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how
              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              development remains underexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression
              patterns to project genetic associations onto a shared latent
              space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological data. Our method identifies modules of
              co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action
              but also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, highlights
              functionally important genes that lack direct associations yet are
              implicated in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              advances our understanding of genetic contributions to disease by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This
              framework offers a powerful tool for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel drug mechanisms, moving the field of
              functional genomics towards a more holistic understanding of
              complex traits.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation revealed that key functional genes, despite lacking
              direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters
              of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
              offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations
              through the prism of gene expression modules.

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
              with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER shows
              proficiency in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing their mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet functionally
              significant are identified within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages
              gene expression patterns to bridge genetic associations and
              pharmacological data. Here we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              effectively maps these associations onto a latent space defined by
              gene co-expression modules, facilitating a joint analysis of gene
              function and drug effects. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using
              a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we highlight that PhenoPLIER
              can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding
              of genetic contributions to complex traits by integrating
              co-expression patterns, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This novel
              framework holds promise for drug repurposing and the
              identification of novel drug mechanisms, potentially accelerating
              the development of targeted treatments.

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This space is constructed upon modules of
              co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              effective in accurately predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, we reveal that certain functionally critical genes,
              despite lacking direct associations, are identified within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel
              framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages
              gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a
              shared latent space, facilitating the analysis of gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbations. By analyzing
              modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, we
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our approach prioritizes functionally important
              genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in
              trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits by
              highlighting the importance of gene co-expression networks. This
              novel framework not only contextualizes genetic associations but
              also uncovers potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
              strategies may overlook, offering new avenues for drug repurposing
              and the development of precision medicine.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational strategy that
              integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding their collective
              influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of
              expression regulation under varying conditions—a crucial element
              for the innovation of new therapeutic interventions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms,
              contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in the genesis and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER
              constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules that
              exhibit coherent expression patterns across identical conditions.
              Our findings indicate a significant correlation between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant
              genes within trait-associated modules, even when these genes do
              not show direct associations. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages
              clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic
              associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative method
              offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations
              through the prism of gene modules, enhancing our understanding of
              disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified
              latent space for joint analysis. Our method hinges on the
              identification of gene modules with coherent expression profiles
              across various conditions, which are then correlated with disease
              phenotypes and drug responses. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers
              mechanisms of action, with significant associations observed
              between disease states and gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed
              that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally critical genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring the utility of our approach in
              capturing key players within trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expressed gene clusters, thereby enhancing our
              understanding of genetic underpinnings in diseases and informing
              drug repurposing efforts. This novel framework promises to refine
              the interpretation of genetic studies and propel the discovery of
              therapeutic targets, potentially revolutionizing the clustering of
              complex traits for medical advancements.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation by identifying
              modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent
              cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively
              prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
              associations but are embedded in trait-associated gene modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene approaches by
              leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules,
              providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding their collective
              influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of
              expression regulation under varying conditions—a crucial element
              for the advancement of novel therapeutic interventions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms,
              contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in the genesis and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER
              constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules that
              exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
              Our findings indicate a significant correlation between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The
              methodology demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drugs' mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that lack direct associations within
              trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER enhances the
              interpretation of genetic associations by incorporating clusters
              of co-expressed genes, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This
              novel framework offers a transformative perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
              modules, with implications for disease etiology and drug
              discovery.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, the
              role of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains
              underexplored. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to project genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations
              into a unified latent space for integrated analysis. PhenoPLIER
              constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
              mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by
              contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
              strategies may overlook. This novel framework holds promise for
              drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, offering a
              new perspective on the molecular mechanisms driving disease and
              treatment responses.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological

              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide

              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and

              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of

              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent

              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug

              significant genes within trait-associated modules, even when these
              genes do not exhibit direct associations.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability

              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This

              Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and
              diseases is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet
              current approaches often overlook the intricate interplay of
              gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to
              disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the collective
              influence of gene networks. This gap hinders our ability to fully

              bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological data into a unified latent representation,
              enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene co-expression modules.
              Our method leverages the coordinated expression of gene clusters
              across various conditions, revealing significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
              types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and infers mechanisms of action but also, through a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, identifies key regulatory
              genes that lack direct associations yet are implicated in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to
              contextualize genetic associations within gene networks offers a
              powerful tool for elucidating disease etiology and uncovering
              therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene analyses.
              This framework holds promise for enhancing drug repurposing
              efforts and advancing our understanding of the genetic
              architecture of complex traits.

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of
              genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. The accuracy of PhenoPLIER is evident in its ability
              to predict established drug-disease relationships and deduce
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that lack direct associations but are embedded
              in trait-associated gene modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability
              to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene modules, with implications
              for disease etiology and drug discovery.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model that integrates gene-gene interactions and
              their implications for disease progression remains elusive.
              Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that leverages gene co-expression modules
              to interpret genetic associations within a unified latent space,
              facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbations. PhenoPLIER's framework is
              predicated on the clustering of genes with similar expression
              patterns across various conditions, which we demonstrate to be
              significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our
              results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can
              prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In

              understanding of genetic contributions to disease and informing
              drug repurposing efforts. This approach not only sheds light on
              the underlying mechanisms of complex traits but also opens avenues

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that certain
              functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
              traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our
              tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers
              an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations by
              integrating co-expression gene clusters, thereby enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing
              strategies.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              disease traits are significantly correlated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering
              insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses.
              Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics
              by providing a robust framework that contextualizes genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, thereby
              highlighting overlooked therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
              repurposing. This advancement has the potential to transform our
              understanding of disease mechanisms and accelerate the discovery
              of effective treatments.

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid regulation, we discovered
              that genes lacking direct associations with traits are nonetheless
              highlighted as functionally significant within trait-associated
              modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to
              genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches.
              This innovative framework offers a new perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations via the prism of gene expression
              patterns.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. We provide evidence that PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the
              gap in functional genomics by contextualizing genetic associations
              through gene expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease
              etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
              single-gene strategies may overlook. This framework has broad
              implications for enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms
              and facilitating drug repurposing.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet current approaches often overlook the coordinated expression
              patterns that underlie disease mechanisms. This study addresses
              the gap by leveraging gene co-expression to elucidate the genetic
              basis of diseases and identify potential drug targets. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that
              integrates gene expression profiles with genetic associations to
              identify disease-relevant gene modules and predict drug-disease
              relationships. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              and it successfully highlights important genes that lack direct
              associations but are implicated in disease through module
              participation. By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
              we further validate the significance of these trait-associated
              modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of
              disease etiology by contextualizing genetic associations within
              gene modules, thereby uncovering therapeutic targets that
              single-gene analyses might miss. This approach not only refines
              the interpretation of complex genetic data but also opens new
              avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
              therapeutic targets.

            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study
            show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
            PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
            provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
            through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation across diverse conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based screen investigating lipid regulation, we discovered
              that certain functionally critical genes, although not directly
              associated with traits, are highlighted within trait-associated
              modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of
              PhenoPLIER in prioritizing potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
              associations by integrating co-expression patterns, thereby
              providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug
              discovery and repurposing efforts.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering
              insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses.
              Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover
              therapeutic targets. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in
              functional genomics by providing a robust framework that
              contextualizes genetic associations through gene expression
              patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology
              and informing drug repurposing efforts. This advancement promises
              to refine the clustering of complex traits and accelerate the
              identification of therapeutic targets.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an
              innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is
              constructed from clusters of co-expressed genes under identical

            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an
              innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is
              constructed from clusters of co-expressed genes under identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can
              be critical, yet are identified within trait-associated gene
              clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
              therapeutic targets.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
              complex traits and pharmacological effects. By integrating
              gene-trait associations with drug perturbation data into a unified
              latent space, PhenoPLIER reveals modules of co-expressed genes
              that correspond to disease states and therapeutic responses. Our
              results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important
              genes that traditional association studies overlook. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the molecular
              underpinnings of diseases but also offers a powerful tool for
              identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing,
              thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
              medicine.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their
              biological roles, and understanding their collective influence on
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions—a critical factor
              in the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
              and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER,
              an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is
              constructed upon clusters of co-expressed genes under identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              linked to gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can
              be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
              clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
              therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex architecture of traits suggests that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. This
              gap in knowledge hinders the development of new therapies and the
              repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to
              elucidate the genetic basis of diseases and identify potential
              therapeutic targets. By integrating gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where
              gene modules with coherent expression profiles are analyzed in
              conjunction with complex traits. Our results demonstrate that
              disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and infers drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that
              traditional association studies overlook. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic underpinnings of
              complex diseases but also offers a powerful tool for drug
              repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets,
              thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
              medicine.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is pivotal for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet current models inadequately capture the essence of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual gene functions
              in disease mechanisms, they fall short in elucidating the
              collective influence of gene networks. Addressing this gap, we

              into a unified latent space, facilitating the simultaneous

              these modules, which consist of genes with coordinated expression
              patterns, are significantly linked to diseases within relevant

              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
