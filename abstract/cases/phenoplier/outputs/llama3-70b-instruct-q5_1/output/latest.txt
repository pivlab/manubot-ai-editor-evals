          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their biological roles. Elucidating how these genes influence
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is critical for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.


          I made some minor changes to improve the clarity and coherence of the
          text, including:


          * Adding a few words to enhance sentence structure and flow

          * Changing some word choices for better precision and consistency
          (e.g., "specifico" -> "specific", "determining" -> "elucidating")

          * Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones for easier reading

          * Adding transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences

          * Using more precise vocabulary (e.g., "mechanistic understanding"
          instead of "insight")

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While complex traits arise from the interplay of multiple genes in
          specific contexts, understanding how these genes influence disease
          mechanisms remains a significant challenge. Despite the progress made
          by transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering individual
          gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression, yet remain poorly understood. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs
          and inferring mechanisms of action; furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, revealing potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting
          the importance of considering gene expression patterns in
          understanding disease etiology and identifying drug mechanisms.

          Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts
          to perform their functions is crucial for determining their influence
          on complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression,
          highlighting the need for a more comprehensive approach. Here we

          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, ultimately providing a more nuanced
          understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which has been shown to be
          crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.


          I made some minor changes to improve the clarity, coherence, and
          readability of the abstract:


          * Changed "concierto" to "concert" (correct spelling)

          * Added "execute their roles" to clarify gene function

          * Changed "requires a mechanistic understanding" to "necessitates a
          mechanistic understanding" for better phrasing

          * Changed "helped uncover the role" to "have helped uncover the role"
          for subject-verb agreement

          * Changed "predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role" to
          "predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role" for more
          precise language

          * Added "diverse" to describe conditions for better clarity

          * Changed "By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets"
          to "By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets" to specify the type of targets.

          Understanding how genes interact with each other to influence complex
          traits is crucial for developing effective therapies, yet the current
          state-of-the-art in transcriptome-wide association studies has
          limitations in uncovering the role of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology. To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across specific conditions. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease

          PhenoPLIER's ability to prioritize functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.
          By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
          more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations, revealing
          potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene
          strategies and highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene
          interactions in disease research.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their biological roles. Elucidating how these genes influence
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is critical for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Notably, we
          find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While complex traits arise from the coordinated action of multiple
          genes in specific contexts, elucidating their regulation across
          diverse conditions remains a crucial step towards developing novel
          therapies. Despite transcriptome-wide association studies shedding
          light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          disease etiology and progression, underscoring the need for a more
          comprehensive approach. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a joint analysis via modules of co-expressed
          genes across similar conditions. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action; furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By contextualizing genetic associations through groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts
          is crucial for deciphering their roles in complex traits. Despite the
          significance of this insight in developing new therapies, current
          models of trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          critical to disease origin and progression, yet remain understudied.

          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

          we uncover significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predict known
          drug-disease pairs, and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our
          approach prioritizes functionally important players lacking
          associations, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
          of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play
          a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations, revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          I made some minor changes to improve the clarity and readability of
          the text, including:


          * Changing "concierto" to "specific contexts"

          * Adding a few words to improve sentence flow

          * Changing "it has been shown that this insight is critical" to "this
          insight is crucial" for concision

          * Using more precise language, such as "diverse conditions" instead of
          "different conditions"

          * Changing "predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role"
          to "suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role" for
          variation in wording

          * Adding an article ("a") before "computational approach" for
          correctness

          * Changing "we observe that diseases are significantl associated" to
          "we find that diseases are significantly associated" for clarity

          * Changing "and our approach is accurate in predicting" to "and our
          approach accurately predicts" for concision

          * Using more precise language, such as "functionally important players
          lacking associations" instead of "functionally important players lack
          associations"

          * Changing "By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies" to "By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations,
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies" for
          concision.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Understanding how genes interact to shape complex traits is crucial
          for deciphering disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are

          co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our method reveals
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs,
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate PhenoPLIER's
          ability to prioritize functionally important players using a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation, demonstrating its potential to
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately advancing our
          understanding of complex traits and disease etiology.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes function in concert with each other within specific contexts to
          perform their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions. This insight has been shown to be crucial
          for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations,
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          I made some minor changes to improve the clarity and readability of
          the abstract, including:


          * Reorganizing sentences for better flow

          * Adding transitional phrases to connect ideas

          * Changing some word choices for improved precision (e.g., "concierto"
          -> "concert", "specifico" -> "specific")

          * Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones for easier
          comprehension

          * Adding a few words to enhance sentence structure and coherence

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While complex traits arise from the interplay of multiple genes in
          specific contexts, understanding how these genes influence disease
          etiology has been hindered by the limitations of traditional
          transcriptome-wide association studies. These studies have primarily
          focused on individual genes, neglecting the crucial role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease origin and progression. To bridge this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes
          with similar expression patterns across conditions, we reveal that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and
          infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes
          functionally important players in trait-associated modules,
          highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for
          projecting genetic associations onto disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, offering new avenues for therapeutic discovery and
          development.

          Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts
          to perform their functions is crucial for determining their influence
          on complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in
          disease origin and progression - a gap that remains to be filled. Here
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that fills this gap

          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, revealing

          PhenoPLIER, demonstrating its ability to contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is a revised abstract for the manuscript:


          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          genetic association data with pharmacological perturbation information
          into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. This
          framework is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across diverse conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases
          are significantly linked to gene modules specifically expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          validate PhenoPLIER's efficacy using a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation, demonstrating that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules. By
          incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoLIKELY contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While understanding the genetic basis of complex traits is crucial for
          developing effective therapies, current approaches often focus on
          individual genes, neglecting the critical role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation, enabling joint analysis of these complex
          relationships. By clustering genes with similar expression patterns
          across conditions, we identify modules significantly associated with
          diseases in relevant cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease
          pairs, and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach
          prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations,
          revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. By contextualizing genetic associations through
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          highlighting its broader significance in uncovering disease etiology
          and informing drug development.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is
          crucial for developing new therapies, yet current transcriptome-wide
          association studies have limitations in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Specifically, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression,
          but existing approaches fail to fully capture these interactions. Here
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our approach provides a mechanistic understanding
          of expression regulation across different conditions, moving the field
          forward towards developing more effective therapies.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          genetic association data with pharmacological perturbation information
          into a unified latent representation. This representation is rooted in
          modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across diverse
          conditions. Our analysis reveals significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell
          types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation highlights the importance of functionally critical players
          that lack individual associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed
          gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations,
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Since genes operate in concert to perform their functions,
          understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          grasp of expression regulation across different conditions – a crucial
          insight for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture emphasize the pivotal role of gene-gene interactions in
          disease origin and progression.

          Understanding the etiology of complex diseases requires elucidating
          the intricate relationships between genetic associations and gene
          expression patterns, which remains a significant challenge in the
          field of functional genomics. While individual genes have been
          implicated in disease-relevant mechanisms through transcriptome-wide
          association studies, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, highlighting
          the need for a more comprehensive approach to uncover therapeutic
          targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation, enabling the joint analysis
          of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different
          conditions. By applying PhenoPLIER, we demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer
          mechanisms of action, thereby contextualizing genetic associations and
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is
          critical for developing new therapies, yet current transcriptome-wide
          association studies have limitations in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Specifically, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression,
          but existing approaches fail to fully capture these interactions.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs,
          infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important
          players in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby
          providing a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions with broader significance for disease therapy
          development.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates genetic association data with pharmacological perturbation
          information into a unified latent representation. This framework is
          grounded on gene modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          diverse conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules specifically expressed in
          relevant cell types, and demonstrates high accuracy in predicting
          established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. As genes operate in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to execute their functions,
          elucidating how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse
          conditions - a crucial insight for developing novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
          role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          Understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases is crucial for
          developing effective therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression.
          However, current approaches often overlook the importance of
          co-expressed genes in contextualizing genetic associations. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By mapping modules of

          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs,
          and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes
          functionally important players lacking associations in
          trait-associated modules, revealing potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions, highlighting its potential to
          uncover novel therapeutic targets and inform drug repurposing efforts.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. This
          representation is derived from modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across diverse conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          specifically expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, by applying CRISPR screening to lipid regulation,
          we demonstrate that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Since genes operate in
          concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, determining how they influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions - a critical insight for developing novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression.


          I made some changes to improve clarity, coherence, and readability:


          * Simplified sentence structures for easier comprehension

          * Added transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences

          * Changed some word choices to enhance precision and concision (e.g.,
          "novel" instead of "new", "unifying" instead of "joint")

          * Emphasized key findings and implications to highlight the
          significance of PhenoPLIER

          * Minor adjustments to punctuation and formatting for better flow

          Here is the revised abstract:


          Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases is crucial
          for developing effective therapeutic strategies, yet current
          approaches often fall short by focusing on individual genes rather
          than their interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of single genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          critical role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately
          highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions for
          understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating co-expressed gene clusters, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. As genes operate in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to execute their functions,
          elucidating how they influence complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying
          conditions – a crucial insight for developing novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
          trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
          role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While understanding the genetic basis of complex traits is crucial for
          developing new therapies, current transcriptome-wide association
          studies have limitations in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. Specifically, modern models of complex
          trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical
          role in disease origin and progression, yet existing approaches often
          overlook these interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of
          action, and prioritizes functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, revealing
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and providing a
          more comprehensive understanding of complex trait etiology and
          therapeutic mechanisms.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          execute their biological roles. Elucidating how these genes influence
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for developing
          novel therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease etiology and progression. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic
          targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.


          I made some minor changes to improve clarity and readability,
          including:


          * Adding transitional phrases to connect sentences

          * Using more precise vocabulary (e.g., "execute their biological
          roles" instead of "perform their functions")

          * Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones for better flow

          * Emphasizing the significance of the research by using words like
          "crucial" and "pivotal"

          * Adding a few words to make the language more concise and formal.

          While complex traits are shaped by the coordinated action of multiple
          genes in specific contexts, our understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions remains incomplete. This knowledge gap

          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of
          action, and reveals potential therapeutic targets overlooked by

          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting

          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.


          I made some changes to improve the clarity and coherence of the
          abstract:


          * Simplified sentence structures for easier reading

          * Added transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences

          * Changed some wording to enhance precision and consistency (e.g.,
          "perform their functions" -> "execute their roles")

          * Emphasized key concepts, such as the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and progression

          * Highlighted the advantages of PhenoPLIER, including its ability to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets

          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of

          Here is the revised abstract:


          Genetic studies have long sought to elucidate the complex
          relationships between genes and their role in disease etiology.
          Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a critical
          gap remains in understanding how gene interactions influence complex
          traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this
          gap by integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation. By analyzing
          modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations, accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs, and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the significance of
          considering gene interactions in disease origin and progression,
          thereby providing new avenues for therapeutic discovery and drug
          repurposing.

          Genes function in harmony with each other within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and
          progression. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          investigate lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
          players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations, uncovering potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While complex traits arise from the coordinated actions of multiple
          genes in specific contexts, understanding how these genes interact to
          regulate expression across different conditions remains a crucial gap
          in developing effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in
          disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a vital role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          contextualizing genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers
          mechanisms of action, and reveals potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, ultimately providing a powerful
          tool for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes function in harmony with each other within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Unraveling how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and
          progression. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          * Simplified sentence structures for better readability

          * Added transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences

          * Changed some word choices to improve precision and concision (e.g.,
          "execute their roles" instead of "perform their functions")

          * Emphasized key points using phrases like "crucial for developing

          Understanding the etiology of complex traits and identifying
          therapeutic targets requires a comprehensive grasp of how genes
          interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Despite the progress made by transcriptome-wide association
          studies in uncovering individual gene roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression, highlighting a
          significant knowledge gap. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers
          mechanisms of action, and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, underscoring its promise in elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is
          crucial for developing new therapies, as individual gene functions are
          context-dependent. However, current approaches, such as
          transcriptome-wide association studies, only provide a partial picture
          of disease mechanisms by focusing on individual genes. A critical gap
          remains in understanding how genes work together to drive disease
          origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By integrating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations,
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, and
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Our approach demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          understanding complex traits.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          execute their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, crucial for developing novel
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.
          Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While understanding the complex interplay between genes is crucial for
          elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets,
          current models are limited in their ability to capture the intricate
          relationships between genes and their impact on complex traits. To
          address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling a
          joint analysis of these interactions. By clustering co-expressed genes
          into modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential to uncover new
          disease etiologies and identify repurposed drug candidates.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          The intricate interplay between genes underlies complex traits, and
          deciphering their expression patterns across diverse conditions is
          crucial for understanding disease etiology and developing effective
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for a more
          comprehensive approach to elucidate complex trait architecture. Here,
          we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis of co-expressed
          gene modules across similar conditions. By contextualizing genetic
          associations within these modules, PhenoPLIER uncovers potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players
          in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen
          analyzing lipid regulation, underscoring the significance of
          PhenoPLIER in revealing disease etiology and identifying therapeutic
          targets.

          Genes do not act in isolation; instead, they collaborate with each
          other in specific contexts to execute their functions. Unraveling how
          genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This
          insight has been demonstrated to be pivotal for developing novel
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease onset and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While complex traits arise from the interplay of multiple genes in
          specific contexts, elucidating the mechanisms underlying gene
          expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for
          developing effective therapies. Despite the progress made by
          transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering individual genes'
          roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
          progression. To bridge this knowledge gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint analysis framework
          based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By contextualizing genetic
          associations through these gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action.
          Notably, our approach prioritizes functionally important players
          lacking associations in trait-associated modules, as demonstrated
          through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, thereby
          highlighting the significance of gene co-expression patterns in
          disease etiology and therapeutic discovery.

          Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts
          is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms underlying complex traits.
          Despite the importance of this insight, current approaches to
          understanding gene regulation have limitations; while
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
          progression - yet, these interactions remain poorly understood. Here,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By

          patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic

          Genes operate in harmony with each other in specific contexts to
          execute their functions. Unraveling how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is essential for
          developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations, uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, and provide insights into
          disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms. Notably, we observe that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using

          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts
          is crucial for elucidating complex traits and developing effective
          therapies. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies,
          modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression, highlighting
          a critical gap in our understanding of these interactions. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation, enabling the joint analysis of
          co-expressed gene modules across different conditions. By
          contextualizing genetic associations within relevant cell types,
          PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Our approach also prioritizes functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules, underscoring its
          potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing
          existing drugs, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex
          traits and disease etiology.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, and
          understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight
          is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide

          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait

          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations, revealing potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While genetic studies have made significant progress in understanding
          the etiology of complex diseases, the current state-of-the-art is
          limited by its focus on individual genes, neglecting the crucial role
          of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To fill
          this gap, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions is essential for developing effective therapies.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological
          perturbation data to identify modules of co-expressed genes associated
          with complex traits. By contextualizing genetic associations within
          these gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene strategies and predicts known drug-disease pairs
          with high accuracy. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack
          individual associations, highlighting its potential for uncovering
          novel mechanisms of action and repurposing existing drugs to treat
          complex diseases.

          Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts
          is crucial for determining their influence on complex traits. Despite
          the importance of this insight for developing new therapies, current
          models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          critical role in disease origin and progression, which has not been
          fully addressed by traditional transcriptome-wide association studies.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
          grouping co-expressed genes into modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by

          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. This insight has been shown to be crucial for developing
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is rooted in modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          While understanding the complex interplay between genes and their
          environments is crucial for deciphering disease etiology and
          identifying therapeutic targets, current approaches often focus on
          individual genes, neglecting the critical role of gene-gene
          interactions in shaping complex traits. To address this gap, we
          developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological
          perturbation data to uncover latent patterns of gene expression
          underlying disease mechanisms. By clustering co-expressed genes into
          modules and contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER reveals
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies,
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of
          action. Notably, our approach prioritizes functionally important
          players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual
          associations, demonstrating its power in uncovering novel insights
          into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities.

          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their biological roles. Elucidating how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is
              critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.


              I made some minor changes to improve the clarity and coherence of
              the text, including:


              * Adding a few words to enhance sentence structure and flow

              * Changing some word choices for better precision and consistency
              (e.g., "specifico" -> "specific", "determining" -> "elucidating")

              * Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones for easier reading

              * Adding transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences

              * Using more precise vocabulary (e.g., "mechanistic understanding"
              instead of "insight")

              Here is the revised abstract:


              While complex traits arise from the interplay of multiple genes in
              specific contexts, understanding how these genes influence disease
              mechanisms remains a significant challenge. Despite the progress
              made by transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering
              individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origin and progression, yet remain poorly understood. Here
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action; furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and
              highlighting the importance of considering gene expression
              patterns in understanding disease etiology and identifying drug
              mechanisms.

              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions is crucial for determining
              their influence on complex traits. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical
              role in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for
              a more comprehensive approach. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show

              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER,
              demonstrating its ability to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions, which has been shown to be
              crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              across identical conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              I made some minor changes to improve the clarity, coherence, and
              readability of the abstract:

              * Changed "requires a mechanistic understanding" to "necessitates

              * Changed "helped uncover the role" to "have helped uncover the

              * Changed "predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role" to "predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role"
              for more precise language

              * Added "diverse" to describe conditions for better clarity

              * Changed "By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets" to "By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets" to specify the type of
              targets.

              Understanding how genes interact with each other to influence
              complex traits is crucial for developing effective therapies, yet
              the current state-of-the-art in transcriptome-wide association
              studies has limitations in uncovering the role of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology. To fill this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on

              ability to prioritize functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive understanding of genetic
              associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets that may
              have been missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the
              importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease

            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this

            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their biological roles. Elucidating how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is critical
              for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce

              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Notably, we find that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate
              that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

              Here is the revised abstract:


              While complex traits arise from the coordinated action of multiple
              genes in specific contexts, elucidating their regulation across
              diverse conditions remains a crucial step towards developing novel
              therapies. Despite transcriptome-wide association studies shedding
              light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease etiology and progression, underscoring the need for a more
              comprehensive approach. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint analysis via
              modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action;
              furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              contextualizing genetic associations through groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing
              our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific
              contexts is crucial for deciphering their roles in complex traits.
              Despite the significance of this insight in developing new
              therapies, current models of trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are critical to disease origin and

              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

              conditions, we uncover significant associations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important
              players lacking associations, revealing potential targets

              Understanding how genes interact to shape complex traits is
              crucial for deciphering disease etiology and identifying
              therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms,
              modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. Here,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar
              conditions. Our method reveals significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate PhenoPLIER's
              ability to prioritize functionally important players using a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, demonstrating its potential to
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover therapeutic targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately advancing our
              understanding of complex traits and disease etiology.

              Here is the revised abstract:


              While complex traits arise from the interplay of multiple genes in
              specific contexts, understanding how these genes influence disease
              etiology has been hindered by the limitations of traditional
              transcriptome-wide association studies. These studies have
              primarily focused on individual genes, neglecting the crucial role
              of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To
              bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions, we reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease
              pairs, and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach
              prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules, highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful
              framework for projecting genetic associations onto disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for therapeutic
              discovery and development.

              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions is crucial for determining
              their influence on complex traits. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression -
              a gap that remains to be filled. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that fills this gap by mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, revealing modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates genetic association data with pharmacological
              perturbation information into a unified latent representation,
              enabling joint analysis. This framework is built upon modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across diverse
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              linked to gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate
              PhenoPLIER's efficacy using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
              demonstrating that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules. By

              Here is the revised abstract:


              Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is
              crucial for developing new therapies, yet current
              transcriptome-wide association studies have limitations in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. Specifically, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical
              role in disease origin and progression, but existing approaches
              fail to fully capture these interactions. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our approach provides a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions, moving the field forward towards developing
              more effective therapies.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates genetic association data with pharmacological
              perturbation information into a unified latent representation.
              This representation is rooted in modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns across diverse conditions. Our
              analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and
              gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types,
              accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation highlights the importance of functionally
              critical players that lack individual associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Since genes operate in
              concert to perform their functions, understanding how they
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic grasp of
              expression regulation across different conditions – a crucial
              insight for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture emphasize the pivotal role of gene-gene interactions
              in disease origin and progression.

              Understanding the etiology of complex diseases requires
              elucidating the intricate relationships between genetic
              associations and gene expression patterns, which remains a
              significant challenge in the field of functional genomics. While
              individual genes have been implicated in disease-relevant
              mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for a more
              comprehensive approach to uncover therapeutic targets. Here, we

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation, enabling the joint analysis of
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different
              conditions. By applying PhenoPLIER, we demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs,
              and infer mechanisms of action, thereby contextualizing genetic

              Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is
              critical for developing new therapies, yet current
              transcriptome-wide association studies have limitations in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. Specifically, modern models of the architecture of
              complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression, but existing approaches
              fail to fully capture these interactions. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers
              mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important
              players in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              thereby providing a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions with broader significance
              for disease therapy development.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates genetic association data with pharmacological
              perturbation information into a unified latent representation.
              This framework is grounded on gene modules exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across diverse conditions. Our analysis
              reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, and
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. As genes
              operate in concert with each other in specific contexts to execute
              their functions, elucidating how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions - a crucial insight for
              developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease origin and progression.


              I made several changes to improve the clarity, coherence, and

              Understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases is crucial for
              developing effective therapeutic strategies. While

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation, enabling
              joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across diverse
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules specifically expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              by applying CRISPR screening to lipid regulation, we demonstrate
              that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Since
              genes operate in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions, determining how they influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions - a critical insight for
              developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression.


              I made some changes to improve clarity, coherence, and
              readability:


              * Simplified sentence structures for easier comprehension

              * Added transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences

              * Changed some word choices to enhance precision and concision
              (e.g., "novel" instead of "new", "unifying" instead of "joint")

              * Emphasized key findings and implications to highlight the
              significance of PhenoPLIER

              * Minor adjustments to punctuation and formatting for better flow

              Understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases is
              crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies, yet
              current approaches often fall short by focusing on individual
              genes rather than their interactions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of single genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation
              data into a unified latent representation, enabling joint
              analysis. This representation is rooted in modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across diverse conditions.
              Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by leveraging a CRISPR screen
              to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally critical
              players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene
              clusters, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations,
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. As genes operate in concert with each other in
              specific contexts to execute their functions, elucidating how they
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across varying conditions – a crucial
              insight for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease origin and progression.

              While understanding the genetic basis of complex traits is crucial
              for developing new therapies, current transcriptome-wide
              association studies have limitations in uncovering the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Specifically,
              modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression, yet existing approaches often overlook these
              interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational

              demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              * Using more precise vocabulary (e.g., "execute their biological
              roles" instead of "perform their functions")

              * Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones for better flow

              * Emphasizing the significance of the research by using words like
              "crucial" and "pivotal"

              * Adding a few words to make the language more concise and formal.

              While complex traits are shaped by the coordinated action of
              multiple genes in specific contexts, our understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions remains
              incomplete. This knowledge gap hinders the development of
              effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are crucial to disease origin and progression. Here,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
              common latent representation, enabling the joint analysis of
              modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. By
              contextualizing genetic associations in this way, our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of
              action, and reveals potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies, ultimately providing new insights into
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is
              crucial for developing new therapies, as these interactions are
              critical for disease mechanisms. Despite the progress made by

              Genes function in harmony with each other within specific contexts
              to execute their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial
              for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes'
              involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. Our
              analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              framework that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene strategies.

              * Emphasized key concepts, such as the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and progression

              Here is the revised abstract:


              Genetic studies have long sought to elucidate the complex
              relationships between genes and their role in disease etiology.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              critical gap remains in understanding how gene interactions
              influence complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic
              targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation. By analyzing modules of co-expressed genes
              across similar conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and
              reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              findings highlight the significance of considering gene
              interactions in disease origin and progression, thereby providing
              new avenues for therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing.

              Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is
              crucial for developing new therapies, as individual gene functions
              are context-dependent. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in

              Genes function in harmony with each other within specific contexts
              to execute their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial
              for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide

              involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Our analysis
              reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking

              While complex traits arise from the coordinated actions of

              interact to regulate expression across different conditions

              Here is the revised abstract:


              Understanding how genes interact to shape complex traits is
              crucial for developing new therapies, as determining their
              influence on disease mechanisms requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. However, while transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a critical role in disease origin and progression - a gap that
              remains to be filled. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis, contextualizing
              genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes
              functionally important players in trait-associated modules,
              ultimately providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex
              traits and their underlying gene interactions.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes function in harmony with each other within specific contexts
              to execute their roles. Unraveling how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial
              for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes'
              involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. Our
              analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with

              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded
              on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed

              strategies.

              * Added transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences

              * Emphasized key points using phrases like "crucial for developing
              novel therapies" and "pivotal role in disease etiology and
              progression"

              * Standardized terminology throughout the abstract (e.g., "complex
              trait architecture" instead of "models of complex traits")

              * Added a few words to improve sentence flow and coherence

              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              execute their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions, crucial for developing novel
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
              etiology and progression. Our analysis reveals that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies.

              While understanding the complex interplay between genes is crucial
              for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic
              targets, current models are limited in their ability to capture
              the intricate relationships between genes and their impact on
              complex traits. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation, enabling a joint analysis of these
              interactions. By clustering co-expressed genes into modules,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action, highlighting its potential to uncover new disease
              etiologies and identify repurposed drug candidates.

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe
            that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
            PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
            that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
            data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies.

              Genes operate in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              execute their functions. Elucidating how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which has been
              shown to be crucial for developing novel therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Here is the revised abstract:


              The intricate interplay between genes underlies complex traits,
              and deciphering their expression patterns across diverse
              conditions is crucial for understanding disease etiology and
              developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
              progression, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive
              approach to elucidate complex trait architecture. Here, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis of
              co-expressed gene modules across similar conditions. By
              contextualizing genetic associations within these modules,
              PhenoPLIER uncovers potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies, accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach
              prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation, underscoring the significance of PhenoPLIER in
              revealing disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
            PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
            known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
            Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
            find that functionally important players lack associations but are
            prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes do not act in isolation; instead, they collaborate with each
              other in specific contexts to execute their functions. Unraveling
              how genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions.
              This insight has been demonstrated to be pivotal for developing
              novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease
              onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded
              on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              While complex traits arise from the interplay of multiple genes in
              specific contexts, elucidating the mechanisms underlying gene
              expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for
              developing effective therapies. Despite the progress made by
              transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering individual
              genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin
              and progression. To bridge this knowledge gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a joint analysis framework based on modules of co-expressed genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              contextualizing genetic associations through these gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies, accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, our approach
              prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations in
              trait-associated modules, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen
              analyzing lipid regulation, thereby highlighting the significance
              of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and therapeutic
              discovery.

              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific

              complex traits. Despite the importance of this insight, current

              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific
              contexts is crucial for elucidating complex traits and developing
              effective therapies. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide
              association studies, modern models of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and
              progression, highlighting a critical gap in our understanding of
              these interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation, enabling the joint analysis of co-expressed gene
              modules across different conditions. By contextualizing genetic
              associations within relevant cell types, PhenoPLIER reveals
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers
              mechanisms of action. Our approach also prioritizes functionally
              important players in trait-associated modules, underscoring its
              potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and
              repurposing existing drugs, ultimately advancing our understanding
              of complex traits and disease etiology.

              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Here is the revised abstract:


              While genetic studies have made significant progress in
              understanding the etiology of complex diseases, the current
              state-of-the-art is limited by its focus on individual genes,
              neglecting the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease
              origin and progression. To fill this gap, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different conditions
              is essential for developing effective therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological
              perturbation data to identify modules of co-expressed genes
              associated with complex traits. By contextualizing genetic
              associations within these gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and
              predicts known drug-disease pairs with high accuracy. Furthermore,
              our approach prioritizes functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual
              associations, highlighting its potential for uncovering novel
              mechanisms of action and repurposing existing drugs to treat
              complex diseases.

              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific
              contexts is crucial for determining their influence on complex
              traits. Despite the importance of this insight for developing new
              therapies, current models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression, which has not been fully addressed by traditional
              transcriptome-wide association studies. Here, we introduce

              Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to execute

              While understanding the complex interplay between genes and their
              environments is crucial for deciphering disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets, current approaches often focus on
              individual genes, neglecting the critical role of gene-gene
              interactions in shaping complex traits. To address this gap, we
              developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with
              pharmacological perturbation data to uncover latent patterns of
              gene expression underlying disease mechanisms. By clustering
              co-expressed genes into modules and contextualizing genetic
              associations, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, our
              approach prioritizes functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual
              associations, demonstrating its power in uncovering novel insights
              into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities.

              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Here is the revised abstract:


              Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific
              contexts is crucial for deciphering complex traits and developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a vital role in disease origin and progression - yet, this aspect
              remains understudied. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations, revealing potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action; furthermore, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").
