Here is a revised version of the abstract:

Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their biological roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.

I made some minor changes to improve the clarity and coherence of the text, including:

* Adding a few words to enhance sentence structure and flow
* Changing some word choices for better precision and consistency (e.g., &quot;specifico&quot; -&gt; &quot;specific&quot;, &quot;determining&quot; -&gt; &quot;elucidating&quot;)
* Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones for easier reading
* Adding transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences
* Using more precise vocabulary (e.g., &quot;mechanistic understanding&quot; instead of &quot;insight&quot;)

Here is the revised abstract:

While complex traits arise from the coordinated action of multiple genes in specific contexts, elucidating their regulation across diverse conditions remains a crucial step towards developing novel therapies. Despite transcriptome-wide association studies shedding light on individual genes&#39; roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive approach. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint analysis via modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions.

While complex traits arise from the coordinated action of multiple genes in specific contexts, elucidating their regulation across diverse conditions remains a crucial step towards developing novel therapies. Despite transcriptome-wide association studies shedding light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive approach. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint analysis via modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions.

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates genetic association data with pharmacological perturbation information into a unified latent representation. This representation is rooted in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across diverse conditions. Our analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation highlights the importance of functionally critical players that lack individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Since genes operate in concert to perform their functions, understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across different conditions – a crucial insight for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes&#39; roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture emphasize the pivotal role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression.

Here is a revised version of the abstract:

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. This representation is rooted in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across diverse conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by leveraging a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally critical players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene clusters, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. As genes operate in concert with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions, elucidating how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions – a crucial insight for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes&#39; roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

I made some minor changes to improve clarity and readability, including:

* Reorganizing sentence structure for better flow
* Adding transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences
* Using more precise vocabulary (e.g., "execute their roles" instead of "perform their functions")
* Emphasizing key findings and implications
* Standardizing punctuation and formatting

Here is the revised abstract:

While complex traits arise from the coordinated actions of multiple genes in specific contexts, understanding how these genes interact to regulate expression across different conditions remains a crucial gap in developing effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By contextualizing genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and reveals potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, ultimately providing a powerful tool for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel drug repurposing opportunities.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, contextualizing genetic associations by grouping co-expressed genes into modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action; furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genes do not act in isolation; instead, they collaborate with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions. Unraveling how genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight has been demonstrated to be pivotal for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Here is the revised abstract:

Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight has been shown to be crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes&#39; roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is rooted in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

I made some minor changes to improve clarity, grammar, and sentence structure while maintaining the original meaning and content of the abstract.

Here is the revised abstract:

While understanding the complex interplay between genes and their environments is crucial for deciphering disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets, current approaches often focus on individual genes, neglecting the critical role of gene-gene interactions in shaping complex traits. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to uncover latent patterns of gene expression underlying disease mechanisms. By clustering co-expressed genes into modules and contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, our approach prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations, demonstrating its power in uncovering novel insights into disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities.

Understanding how genes interact with each other in specific contexts is crucial for deciphering complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes&#39; roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression - yet, this aspect remains understudied. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
