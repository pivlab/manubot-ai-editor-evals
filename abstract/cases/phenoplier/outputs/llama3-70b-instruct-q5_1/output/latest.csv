Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules, highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Here is a revised abstract for the manuscript:

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates genetic association data with pharmacological perturbation information into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis. This framework is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across diverse conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate PhenoPLIER's efficacy using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, demonstrating that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoLIKELY contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

While understanding the genetic basis of complex traits is crucial for developing effective therapies, current approaches often focus on individual genes, neglecting the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling joint analysis of these complex relationships. By clustering genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, we identify modules significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By contextualizing genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, highlighting its broader significance in uncovering disease etiology and informing drug development.
