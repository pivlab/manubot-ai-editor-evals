A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\""Here we\"") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

 Genes function in concert with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space, facilitating joint analysis. Genes operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is vital for elucing the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is essential for therapy development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to revealing individual gene involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach excels in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deducing mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important yet unassociated players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a fresh framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 Genes operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for the development of novel therapies.
