          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes function in concert within specific contexts to perform their
          roles. To understand how these genes impact complex traits, it's
          essential to comprehend the regulation of gene expression across
          varying conditions. This understanding is critical for the development
          of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that interactions between genes play a pivotal role in the
          onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can provide context to genetic associations and highlight potential
          targets that single-gene strategies might overlook.

          In the field of functional genomics, the intricate relationships
          between genes and their collective influence on complex traits
          necessitate a comprehensive understanding of gene expression
          regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding is pivotal
          for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions are integral to
          disease onset and progression. This paper addresses the gap of
          integrating these interactions into the study of disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our
          findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation disclosed that
          functionally significant genes, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by integrating clusters of co-expressed genes, provides a
          more contextualized understanding of genetic associations and uncovers
          potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies,
          thereby advancing the field of functional genomics.

          The current landscape of genetic research has established that genes
          interact within specific contexts to perform their functions and
          impact complex traits, necessitating a deep understanding of
          expression regulation across varied conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression, a crucial aspect not fully explored yet. To bridge this
          gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a singular latent representation for a comprehensive
          analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates
          a high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally critical genes, which lack
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Thus, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides a contextual understanding of genetic associations
          and identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies,
          thereby advancing the broader field of genetic research towards a more
          comprehensive understanding of complex traits.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their functions. To comprehend how these genes impact complex traits,
          it is essential to have a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This understanding is proven to
          be vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in mechanisms relevant to disease. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          interactions between genes are critical in the onset and progression
          of disease. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a
          comprehensive analysis. This representation is founded on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same
          conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
          uncover potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook.

          Understanding the intricate interplay of genes and their roles in
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of gene
          expression regulation under diverse conditions, a critical aspect in
          the development of novel therapies. Despite the insights gained from
          transcriptome-wide association studies on individual gene roles in
          disease mechanisms, current literature suggests that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression, yet a
          comprehensive analysis of these interactions remains an unmet need.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          method that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This unique representation is constructed upon modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis
          of lipid regulation indicated that although certain functionally
          important genes lack associations, they are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, by incorporating
          clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a fresh
          perspective on genetic associations, unveiling potential targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          The intricate landscape of gene interactions and their roles in
          complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of gene
          expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial
          prerequisite for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have elucidated individual gene roles in disease
          mechanisms, prevailing models of complex traits architecture
          underscore the significant role of gene-gene interactions in disease
          onset and progression, a facet not fully explored. This study
          introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that amalgamates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation,
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions, allows for an in-depth exploration of
          disease-gene interactions. Our results reveal a significant
          association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known

          functionally important players, though lacking direct associations,
          were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating and contextualizing groups of
          co-expressed genes, offers a more comprehensive perspective of genetic
          associations and identifies potential targets that single-gene
          strategies might overlook, thereby advancing our understanding of
          complex disease mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is vital for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          integral to the onset and progression of diseases. In this manuscript,
          we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns within identical conditions. We found that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          significant genes lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Understanding the role of gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression presents a significant challenge in the field of genetic
          studies and functional genomics. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have provided insights into the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          are crucial to disease origin and progression. This study addresses
          the gap in our understanding of these interactions by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This innovative approach is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various
          conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation. Importantly, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important players that lack associations but are found in
          trait-associated modules. This study concludes that PhenoPLIER's
          incorporation of co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This conclusion has significant
          implications for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional
          genomics.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact in various
          contexts is crucial for their functional analysis and the development
          of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          current models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease onset and progression. This
          highlights a gap in our understanding of these interactions and their
          role in disease mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. Our results
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Notably, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes in
          trait-associated modules, even when these genes lack direct
          associations. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
          provides a more nuanced understanding of genetic associations,
          highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This work advances our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions in disease mechanisms and offers a promising approach for
          identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to perform their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is necessary to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the
          role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. Yet,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          interactions between genes are essential for disease onset and
          progression. In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for a combined
          analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes that
          exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          note that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a
          CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By including groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          The complex interplay of genes within specific contexts is essential
          for their function and impacts the development and progression of
          diseases. However, the current understanding of gene expression
          regulation across different conditions, while critical for therapy
          development, fails to fully account for the role of gene-gene
          interactions that modern models predict are vital for complex trait
          architecture. This gap in knowledge hinders our ability to identify
          novel therapeutic targets and understand disease etiology. Addressing
          this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on
          modules of genes co-expressed under similar conditions. Our results
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately associates diseases with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
          associations in trait-associated modules, thereby uncovering potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER
          effectively bridges the gap between gene interactions and complex
          trait architecture, advancing our understanding of disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms, and paving the way for innovative therapeutic
          strategies and drug repurposing opportunities.

          While genes operate collectively within specific contexts to execute
          their functions, understanding their influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This understanding is vital for the

          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, yet

          representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar

          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that essential

          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes play a
          pivotal role in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study,
          we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that amalgamates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is predicated on modules of genes that exhibit similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We note that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our method proves accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and deducing mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation and discovered
          that functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
          are prioritized in trait-related modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide
          context to genetic associations and highlight potential targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Despite advancements in genetic studies and functional genomics,
          elucidating the intricate interplay of genes in diverse contexts to
          influence complex traits remains a challenge. This mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions
          is pivotal for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin
          and progression. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach designed to bridge this gap. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis, based on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. We discovered that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          demonstrated accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis
          of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This indicates that by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and uncover potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This research enhances our understanding of the genetic
          basis of complex traits and disease etiology, providing a promising
          tool for drug repurposing and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
          that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
          disruption data for comprehensive analysis. This method is founded on
          the concept of gene modules, groups of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results reveal
          that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
          predicting known drug-disease pairings and deducing action mechanisms.
          Additionally, our utilization of a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid
          regulation showed that while functionally important elements may lack
          associations, they are nonetheless prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER provides context to genetic associations and
          uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. It is
          widely accepted that genes function synergistically within specific
          contexts. Therefore, understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. Prior research has highlighted
          the importance of this insight in the development of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          unveiling the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression
          of diseases.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits across different conditions is crucial for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed significantly to our understanding of individual genes'
          role in disease mechanisms, a gap remains in comprehensively
          addressing the role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
          progression as predicted by modern models of complex trait
          architecture. To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Further, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
          that functionally important players lacking associations were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We conclude
          that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This finding significantly
          advances our understanding of the role of gene co-expression in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a new avenue for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.

          The study of gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin
          and progression is a critical area in modern genetic research, with
          transcriptome-wide association studies revealing the role of

          discovered that functionally significant players, though lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate
          synergistically within specific contexts to execute their functions.
          Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
          conditions. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of this
          understanding in the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of
          diseases.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the broader field of functional genomics, understanding the
          interplay of genes and their influence on complex traits is pivotal
          for developing new therapies. However, current transcriptome-wide
          association studies, while successful in revealing the roles of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, have limitations in capturing
          the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
          progression. This gap in knowledge hinders the full potential of
          genetic studies and drug repurposing. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that facilitates a joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data by mapping them into a common latent representation based on
          modules of co-expressed genes. Our results demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Interestingly, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players lacking associations were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          enhances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms by
          contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This advancement
          not only fills a critical gap in the study of complex traits but also
          propels forward the broader field of functional genomics and drug
          repurposing.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact and
          influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current
          models predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
          development and progression. This highlights a gap in our
          understanding, as the focus has often been on single genes rather than
          their cooperative behavior. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This innovative method is
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Notably, through a CRISPR screen analysis
          of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players,
          often overlooked in single-gene strategies, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that
          PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can provide a
          more comprehensive context for genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets. This novel approach could significantly
          advance our understanding of gene interactions and their role in
          disease progression, thereby moving the broader field of genetics
          forward.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations
          into a unified latent model for comprehensive analysis. This model is
          constructed based on clusters of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          significantly correlate with gene clusters expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          deduces mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employed a CRISPR
          screen to investigate lipid regulation and discovered that
          functionally significant genes, although not directly associated, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide
          context to genetic associations and identify potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate synergistically in
          specific scenarios to execute their functions. Understanding how these
          genes affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
          of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Understanding the influence of genes on complex traits is a critical
          aspect of developing new therapies, necessitating a comprehensive
          understanding of gene expression regulation across varying conditions.
          Despite the valuable insights gleaned from transcriptome-wide
          association studies into the roles individual genes play in disease
          mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          pivotal in disease origin and progression. However, this aspect often
          remains unexplored, highlighting a significant gap in the field. To
          address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that coalesces gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our
          findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, in a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally vital players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of co-expressed
          genes, can provide context to genetic associations and expose
          potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. Thus, our
          research not only fills the existing gap in understanding the role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease progression but also advances the
          broader field by offering a novel approach for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets.

          Understanding how genes influence complex traits is a critical
          challenge in the field of genomics, particularly in the context of
          disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role, a dimension that remains under-explored. To address this
          gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that
          PhenoPLIER is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, our approach prioritizes
          functionally important genes in trait-associated modules that lack
          associations but are revealed by PhenoPLIER, demonstrating its ability
          to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER offers a
          significant advancement in our understanding of gene-gene interactions
          and their role in complex traits, providing a valuable tool for
          developing new therapies.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data for a comprehensive analysis. This approach is founded on modules
          of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical
          conditions. Our findings indicate a significant association between
          diseases and gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types.
          Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine
          lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes,
          though lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides context to genetic associations and identifies
          potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. Genes
          operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to the onset and
          progression of diseases.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the context of functional genomics, the complex interaction of
          genes and their collective influence on traits and diseases is a
          crucial yet underexplored area. Despite individual gene roles being
          elucidated through transcriptome-wide association studies, the current
          understanding of gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease
          origin and progression remains limited. This research gap hinders the
          development of new therapies and the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets. In response to this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation for joint analysis. This model is built on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. It also prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack associations but are part of trait-associated modules, as
          demonstrated in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new avenue to contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This advancement in understanding gene co-expression and
          its implications in disease etiology and drug mechanisms has the
          potential to revolutionize therapeutic targets identification and drug
          repurposing, thereby advancing the field of genetic studies.

          Within the broader field of genetic research, understanding how genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide
          association studies have illuminated the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex traits predict a
          crucial role for gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
          progression. However, this aspect remains underexplored, creating a
          gap in our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This

          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, contextualizes genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This approach advances our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions in disease progression and holds broader significance for
          the development of new therapies.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis.
          This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings show that
          diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, when
          utilizing a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides context to genetic associations and identifies
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. It is
          well-established that genes operate synergistically within specific
          contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes
          impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is
          crucial for the development of novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          vital in disease onset and progression.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding the influence of
          gene expression regulation across different conditions on complex
          traits is crucial, particularly for the development of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, the modern
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression, an aspect
          not fully explored in current research. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is constructed from modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases
          significantly associate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In a case study using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important genes lacking associations were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This demonstrates PhenoPLIER's
          ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Therefore, our research
          highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression in
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thus contributing
          to the broader field of genetic studies and therapeutic target
          identification.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, the collective action of genes in
          specific contexts is critical for their function and influence on
          complex traits. Despite the recent advancements in transcriptome-wide
          association studies in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, the current understanding of gene-gene
          interactions, which are predicted to play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression, remains limited. This gap in knowledge hinders
          the development of new therapies and the understanding of disease
          etiology. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach designed to fill this gap. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis, thereby providing a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings indicate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrated accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Notably, in a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation,
          functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only
          provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          but also pave the way for drug repurposing and the identification of
          novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional
          genomics.

          In the field of genomics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are key to disease origin and progression.
          However, existing methods fall short in capturing these interactions,
          leaving a gap in our understanding of disease mechanisms. Addressing
          this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This model is
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across various conditions, thereby providing a more comprehensive view
          of gene-gene interactions. Our results reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that important functional players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement not only fills
          a critical gap in our understanding of disease mechanisms but also
          propels the field of genomics towards more effective therapeutic
          strategies.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions is essential to understanding how these
          genes influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for
          devising new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. Contemporary models of complex traits'
          architecture, however, suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          integral to the onset and progression of diseases. We have found that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers action mechanisms. Moreover, through a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that
          functionally significant players are not associated, but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation hinges
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. By including groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The field of functional genomics has made significant strides in
          understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits and
          diseases, with transcriptome-wide association studies shedding light
          on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, these studies often overlook the crucial role gene-gene
          interactions play in disease origin and progression, as predicted by
          modern models of complex trait architecture. This gap in knowledge
          hinders the development of new therapies and the identification of
          therapeutic targets. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling
          the contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Using our
          approach, we found that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicted
          known drug-disease pairs, inferred mechanisms of action, and revealed
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. Our findings underscore the potential of
          PhenoPLIER in enhancing our understanding of disease etiology,
          uncovering drug mechanisms, and paving the way for drug repurposing
          and the development of new therapies.

          In the field of gene expression regulation, the collective action of
          genes in specific contexts is crucial to their function and the
          manifestation of complex traits. Despite transcriptome-wide
          association studies illuminating the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, current models predict gene-gene interactions as
          significant players in disease origin and progression, a gap
          unaddressed by single-gene strategies. This research introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that fills this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is grounded on modules of co-expressed genes
          demonstrating similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and associates
          diseases significantly with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Notably, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation,
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
          associations in trait-associated modules, revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER not only
          addresses the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions but also
          advances the field by providing a tool for uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets, thus paving the way for the development of new
          therapies.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varied conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          influence complex traits. This understanding is vital for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          mechanisms relevant to disease. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          fundamental to the onset and progression of disease. We have found
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation

          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
          including groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding gene interactions
          and their influence on complex traits is vital for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          elucidated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease onset and progression, a perspective not fully addressed in
          current literature. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
          comprehensive analysis. This representation is constructed on modules
          of co-expressed genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel way to contextualize
          genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach advances our
          understanding of complex trait architecture and could significantly
          impact drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic
          targets.

          In the realm of genetic research, a comprehensive understanding of
          gene expression regulation across various conditions is pivotal for
          discerning how genes influence complex traits and, consequently, for
          the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have illuminated the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are instrumental in disease onset and progression, a
          crucial aspect not fully explored in the current literature. This
          study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges
          this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is premised on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our
          findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of
          action, and, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation,
          reveals that functionally important players, overlooked by single-gene
          strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. The
          introduction of PhenoPLIER not only provides a more nuanced
          understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease progression but
          also unveils potential targets, thereby advancing the broader field of
          genetic research and therapeutic development.

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of their expression
          regulation across varying conditions is crucial for understanding how
          these genes impact complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal
          in disease onset and progression. We note that diseases are
          significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease combinations and
          infers action mechanisms. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          significant elements lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We present PhenoPLIER, a

          conditions. By including co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The investigation of how genes interact to influence complex traits is
          a crucial aspect of functional genomics, yet our understanding of gene
          expression regulation across different conditions remains incomplete.
          This knowledge gap hinders the development of new therapies,
          particularly as modern models of complex traits underscore the
          importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have
          elucidated the role of individual genes, but fall short in capturing
          the collective impact of gene modules expressed in disease-relevant
          cell types. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This innovative method is
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, thereby incorporating co-expressed genes
          into the analysis. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, it highlights functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, as
          evidenced by a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. These
          findings underscore the power of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic
          associations and identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked
          by single-gene strategies. This advancement not only enhances our
          understanding of disease etiology but also provides a robust tool for
          drug repurposing and the identification of new therapeutic targets,
          propelling the field of functional genomics forward.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact and
          influence complex traits is critical to developing new therapies.
          Current research has made significant strides in identifying the roles
          of individual genes through transcriptome-wide association studies.
          However, a gap exists in understanding how gene-gene interactions
          contribute to disease origin and progression, as predicted by modern
          models of complex trait architecture. This paper introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this gap.
          PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players, often
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only
          address the open question of gene-gene interactions in disease
          progression but also highlight PhenoPLIER's potential in identifying
          previously missed therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the broader
          field of genetics.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their functions. A comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential to discern how these
          genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is pivotal for creating
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in mechanisms
          relevant to disease. However, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease

          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The field of genetic studies is steadily advancing towards a more
          comprehensive understanding of how genes interact in various contexts
          to influence complex traits. Despite significant progress, a gap
          exists in our understanding of gene-gene interactions and their role
          in disease origin and progression. This knowledge is pivotal for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that projects
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This innovative
          approach is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions, thereby allowing for
          a more nuanced understanding of gene-gene interactions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. A
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation further highlighted that
          functionally important players, often overlooked in single-gene
          strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER in uncovering
          the intricate gene-gene interactions involved in disease progression
          and drug mechanisms, thereby advancing the field of functional
          genomics and paving the way for targeted therapeutic strategies and
          drug repurposing.

          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes operate
          collectively to influence complex traits under varying conditions is
          crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, current models suggest gene-gene interactions
          significantly impact disease onset and progression, highlighting a gap
          in our understanding of complex trait architecture. Our study
          introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges
          this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation leverages modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions, thereby
          enabling a more comprehensive analysis than single-gene strategies.
          Our findings indicate that diseases significantly correlate with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Interestingly, our CRISPR screen of lipid regulation reveals
          functionally important players that lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER offers a more nuanced understanding of
          complex traits, potentially unearthing previously overlooked
          therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic
          research.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The complex nature of diseases necessitates an in-depth understanding
          of the interactions between genes and their regulatory mechanisms
          under various conditions. Despite the valuable insights provided by
          transcriptome-wide association studies on the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, existing research has yet to fully delve into
          the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression. This gap underscores the need for a more comprehensive
          model that can capture these interactions and their impact on complex
          traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation for joint analysis. This model is built upon modules of
          co-expressed genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the
          same conditions, thereby providing a more contextual understanding of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, with PhenoPLIER demonstrating accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation further validates our
          approach, highlighting functionally important genes that, despite
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These results not only answer the need for a more
          integrative model in understanding disease mechanisms but also pave
          the way for more targeted therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing,
          ultimately advancing the field of functional genomics.

          Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a gap
          remains in understanding how genes interact to influence complex
          traits and disease progression, a critical insight for developing new
          therapies. Current models predict that these gene-gene interactions
          are integral to disease origin and progression, yet modern
          methodologies often overlook these interactions, focusing instead on
          individual genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that consolidates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a comprehensive analysis. This representation is premised on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions, enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
          that functionally important players lacking associations were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach
          offers a new perspective on gene-gene interactions in disease
          progression, potentially advancing the development of targeted
          therapies.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their functions. A profound understanding of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential for discerning how these genes
          impact complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed to unveiling the role of individual genes in mechanisms
          related to disease. However, contemporary models of complex traits'
          architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in
          the genesis and progression of diseases. This paper introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a mutual
          latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is premised on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating
          clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to
          genetic associations and identify potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. We note that diseases are significantly linked
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          we discover that functionally significant players, though lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          While the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms has been
          explored through transcriptome-wide association studies, current
          research models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
          role in disease onset and progression. However, the complex trait
          architecture and the mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across different conditions remain largely unexplored. This
          research gap hinders the development of new therapies and the
          identification of potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This model is
          predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions, enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize
          genetic associations and identify potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation revealed that while functionally important players
          may lack direct associations, they are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only addresses the gap in our
          understanding of complex trait architecture and gene-gene interactions
          but also provides a robust method for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional
          genomics and drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is key to developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease onset and progression,
          presenting a gap in our mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation. This approach, based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across similar conditions, allows for a comprehensive analysis,
          highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER successfully
          predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
          that crucial functional players lacking associations were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings underscore the
          potential of PhenoPLIER in advancing our understanding of complex
          trait architecture and disease progression, providing a new avenue for
          the development of targeted therapies.

          Genes function together within specific contexts to carry out their
          roles. To understand how these genes affect complex traits, it is
          vital to comprehend the regulation of gene expression across various
          conditions. Such an understanding is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset
          and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that consolidates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is built upon modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can

          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by
          utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered
          that functionally significant genes, although not directly associated,
          are prioritized in trait-related modules by PhenoPLIER.

          influence on complex traits. Despite advancements in
          transcriptome-wide association studies, which have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, a gap remains
          in understanding how gene-gene interactions contribute to disease
          origin and progression. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach designed to bridge this gap by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of co-expressed genes sharing similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER effectively contextualizes genetic associations and
          identifies potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Diseases were found to be significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER proved
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only address the research gap in
          understanding gene-gene interactions in disease progression, but also
          offer valuable insights for drug repurposing and the identification of
          novel therapeutic targets, propelling the field of functional genomics
          forward.

          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic research, it is widely understood that genes
          operate synergistically within specific contexts to perform their
          functions, and that the regulation of gene expression across varying
          conditions is crucial for understanding complex traits. However, a gap
          exists in the current literature regarding the role of gene-gene
          interactions in the development and progression of diseases, as
          predicted by modern models of complex trait architecture. This paper
          introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to
          bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions, thus enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Our results show significant associations between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore,
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the potential of
          PhenoPLIER as a tool for enhancing our understanding of disease
          mechanisms and for the development of new therapeutic strategies.

          lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally significant players,
          although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only bridge
          the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          but also provide a robust platform for identifying novel therapeutic
          targets and repurposing existing drugs, thereby advancing the broader
          field of functional genomics.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is essential for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to disease onset and
          progression, an aspect not fully addressed in the current literature.
          In response, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
          representation, based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions, allows PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results highlight that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that crucial
          functional players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the
          potential of PhenoPLIER in advancing our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions in disease development and treatment, filling a critical
          gap in the current genetic research landscape.

          Genes function in synergy within specific contexts to execute their
          roles. To comprehend how these genes affect complex traits, we need to
          mechanistically understand expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. Such insight is vital for the development of new
          therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in exposing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          disease onset and progression. In this manuscript, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is devised based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. By incorporating
          clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. We found that diseases are significantly

          lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          despite lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          While genetic studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, understanding how genes interact in complex traits
          remains a significant challenge. This gap in knowledge hinders the
          development of novel therapies, as gene-gene interactions are
          predicted to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To
          address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is established on modules of genes that
          exhibit similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By
          incorporating these co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a context
          for genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene strategies may overlook. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players that lack
          associations in trait-associated modules. This research advances our
          understanding of complex trait architecture, highlighting the
          potential for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The complexity of genetic traits and their regulation poses a
          significant challenge in understanding disease origins and
          progression, with current research often focusing on individual genes
          and their roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, this approach
          overlooks the crucial role of gene-gene interactions predicted by
          modern models of complex trait architecture. Our research introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER
          operates on the principle of gene modules, groups of genes with
          similar expression patterns across various conditions, thereby
          providing a more holistic view of genetic associations. Our results
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, even identifying
          potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. A
          practical application of PhenoPLIER in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
          lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to
          advance our understanding of complex genetic traits and disease
          mechanisms, paving the way for the development of more targeted and
          effective therapies.

              Genes function in concert within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. To understand how these genes impact complex traits,
              it's essential to comprehend the regulation of gene expression
              across varying conditions. This understanding is critical for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes
              play a pivotal role in the onset and progression of diseases. In
              this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. This representation is built upon modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              highlight potential targets that single-gene strategies might
              overlook.

              necessitate a comprehensive understanding of gene expression
              regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene
              interactions are integral to disease onset and progression. This
              paper addresses the gap of integrating these interactions into the
              study of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that amalgamates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
              reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation disclosed
              that functionally significant genes, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by integrating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, provides a more contextualized understanding
              of genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing the field
              of functional genomics.

              The current landscape of genetic research has established that
              genes interact within specific contexts to perform their functions
              and impact complex traits, necessitating a deep understanding of
              expression regulation across varied conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
              onset and progression, a crucial aspect not fully explored yet. To
              bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a singular latent
              representation for a comprehensive analysis. This representation
              is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates a high accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              revealed that functionally critical genes, which lack
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Thus, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a contextual understanding of genetic
              associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies, thereby advancing the broader field of
              genetic research towards a more comprehensive understanding of
              complex traits.

            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed

              expression regulation across varying conditions. This
              understanding is proven to be vital for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
              mechanisms relevant to disease. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes
              are critical in the onset and progression of disease. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is founded on modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets that single-gene strategies may
              overlook.

              Understanding the intricate interplay of genes and their roles in
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under diverse conditions, a critical aspect
              in the development of novel therapies. Despite the insights gained
              from transcriptome-wide association studies on individual gene
              roles in disease mechanisms, current literature suggests that
              gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression, yet a comprehensive analysis of these interactions
              remains an unmet need. Addressing this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that amalgamates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for a joint analysis. This unique
              representation is constructed upon modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our
              findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation indicated that although certain functionally
              important genes lack associations, they are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, by incorporating
              clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a fresh
              perspective on genetic associations, unveiling potential targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby
              advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              The intricate landscape of gene interactions and their roles in
              complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial
              prerequisite for developing novel therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated individual
              gene roles in disease mechanisms, prevailing models of complex
              traits architecture underscore the significant role of gene-gene
              interactions in disease onset and progression, a facet not fully
              explored. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent

              comprehensive perspective of genetic associations and identifies
              potential targets that single-gene strategies might overlook,

              Understanding the role of gene interactions in disease etiology
              and progression presents a significant challenge in the field of
              genetic studies and functional genomics. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have provided insights into the role of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are crucial to disease origin and
              progression. This study addresses the gap in our understanding of
              these interactions by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This innovative approach is based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              as evidenced by a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation.
              Importantly, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players
              that lack associations but are found in trait-associated modules.
              This study concludes that PhenoPLIER's incorporation of
              co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This conclusion has significant implications for drug
              repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets,
              thereby advancing the field of functional genomics.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact in
              various contexts is crucial for their functional analysis and the
              development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, current models of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease onset
              and progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease mechanisms. To
              address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. Our
              results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Notably, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important genes in trait-associated modules, even when these genes
              lack direct associations. By incorporating co-expressed gene
              groups, PhenoPLIER provides a more nuanced understanding of
              genetic associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This work advances our
              understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and
              offers a promising approach for identifying potential targets for
              therapeutic intervention.

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to perform their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is necessary to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the

              The complex interplay of genes within specific contexts is
              essential for their function and impacts the development and
              progression of diseases. However, the current understanding of
              gene expression regulation across different conditions, while
              critical for therapy development, fails to fully account for the
              role of gene-gene interactions that modern models predict are
              vital for complex trait architecture. This gap in knowledge
              hinders our ability to identify novel therapeutic targets and
              understand disease etiology. Addressing this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that unifies gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of
              genes co-expressed under similar conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately associates diseases with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, revealing that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important players lacking associations in trait-associated
              modules, thereby uncovering potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER effectively bridges the
              gap between gene interactions and complex trait architecture,
              advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, and paving the way for innovative therapeutic

              While genes operate collectively within specific contexts to
              execute their functions, understanding their influence on complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation across varying conditions. This understanding is vital
              for the creation of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, yet contemporary models of complex trait architecture
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset
              and progression, a gap that current research fails to address. To
              fill this void, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for a
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is predicated on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
              types. PhenoPLIER proves accurate in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and deducing mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that essential players
              lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies,
              thereby advancing the broader field of gene interaction studies.

              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)

              The intricate interplay of genes in specific contexts is critical
              to their function, and understanding this dynamic is key to
              unraveling complex traits and developing new therapies. While

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              disruption data for comprehensive analysis. This method is founded
              on the concept of gene modules, groups of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results reveal
              that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER
              in predicting known drug-disease pairings and deducing action
              mechanisms. Additionally, our utilization of a CRISPR screen to
              scrutinize lipid regulation showed that while functionally
              important elements may lack associations, they are nonetheless
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides
              context to genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. It is widely accepted that
              genes function synergistically within specific contexts.
              Therefore, understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions. Prior research has highlighted the
              importance of this insight in the development of new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              unveiling the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              the onset and progression of diseases.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial
              for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of
              individual genes' role in disease mechanisms, a gap remains in
              comprehensively addressing the role of gene-gene interactions in
              disease origin and progression as predicted by modern models of
              complex trait architecture. To fill this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait

              The study of gene-gene interactions and their role in disease
              origin and progression is a critical area in modern genetic
              research, with transcriptome-wide association studies revealing
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              However, a gap exists in our understanding of how these genes
              function in concert across different conditions, and this
              mechanistic insight is crucial for the development of new
              therapies. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
            of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific
            contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
            influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for combined analysis. This
              representation is grounded on modules of genes that exhibit
              similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our
              findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Additionally,
              PhenoPLIER proves to be effective in predicting established
              drug-disease pairs and deducing mechanisms of action. Using a
              CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant players, though lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate
              synergistically within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              under varying conditions. Previous research has demonstrated the
              importance of this understanding in the development of new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              the onset and progression of diseases.

              In the broader field of functional genomics, understanding the
              interplay of genes and their influence on complex traits is
              pivotal for developing new therapies. However, current
              transcriptome-wide association studies, while successful in
              revealing the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              have limitations in capturing the critical role of gene-gene
              interactions in disease origin and progression. This gap in
              knowledge hinders the full potential of genetic studies and drug
              repurposing. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that facilitates a joint analysis of
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by
              mapping them into a common latent representation based on modules
              of co-expressed genes. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Interestingly, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms by contextualizing genetic
              associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets missed
              by single-gene strategies. This advancement not only fills a
              critical gap in the study of complex traits but also propels
              forward the broader field of functional genomics and drug
              repurposing.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact and
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              current models predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease development and progression. This highlights a gap in our
              understanding, as the focus has often been on single genes rather
              than their cooperative behavior. In this study, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this gap by
              mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              innovative method is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Notably, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
              found that functionally important players, often overlooked in
              single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that PhenoPLIER's
              incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can provide a more
              comprehensive context for genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets. This novel approach could
              significantly advance our understanding of gene interactions and
              their role in disease progression, thereby moving the broader
              field of genetics forward.

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbations into a unified latent model for comprehensive
              analysis. This model is constructed based on clusters of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions.
              We found that diseases significantly correlate with gene clusters
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and deduces mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we employed a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation and discovered that functionally significant genes,
              although not directly associated, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic
              associations and identify potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. Genes operate synergistically in specific
              scenarios to execute their functions. Understanding how these
              genes affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions.
              This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the
              role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and
              progression.

              Understanding the influence of genes on complex traits is a
              critical aspect of developing new therapies, necessitating a
              comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across
              varying conditions. Despite the valuable insights gleaned from
              transcriptome-wide association studies into the roles individual
              genes play in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and
              progression. However, this aspect often remains unexplored,
              highlighting a significant gap in the field. To address this, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              coalesces gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, in a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally vital players lacking associations
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes, can provide context to genetic associations
              and expose potential targets that single-gene strategies may
              overlook. Thus, our research not only fills the existing gap in
              understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in disease
              progression but also advances the broader field by offering a
              novel approach for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

              Understanding how genes influence complex traits is a critical
              challenge in the field of genomics, particularly in the context of
              disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in

              under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology

              In the context of functional genomics, the complex interaction of
              genes and their collective influence on traits and diseases is a
              crucial yet underexplored area. Despite individual gene roles
              being elucidated through transcriptome-wide association studies,
              the current understanding of gene-gene interactions and their
              impact on disease origin and progression remains limited. This
              research gap hinders the development of new therapies and the
              identification of novel therapeutic targets. In response to this,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This model is built on modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              It also prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              associations but are part of trait-associated modules, as
              demonstrated in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new avenue to contextualize
              genetic associations and identify potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This advancement in understanding gene
              co-expression and its implications in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms has the potential to revolutionize therapeutic targets
              identification and drug repurposing, thereby advancing the field
              of genetic studies.

              Within the broader field of genetic research, understanding how
              genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Although transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models of complex traits predict a crucial role for
              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. However,
              this aspect remains underexplored, creating a gap in our
              understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap
              by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms

              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, contextualizes genetic associations and
              reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              approach advances our understanding of gene-gene interactions in
              disease progression and holds broader significance for the
              development of new therapies.

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is founded on modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings show that diseases have significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types,
              and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, when utilizing a CRISPR
              screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides
              context to genetic associations and identifies potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. It is well-established that
              genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial
              for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding the influence
              of gene expression regulation across different conditions on
              complex traits is crucial, particularly for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
              on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              However, the modern models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and
              progression, an aspect not fully explored in current research. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              constructed from modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases
              significantly associate with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In a case
              study using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found
              that functionally important genes lacking associations were

              importance of considering gene co-expression in understanding
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thus contributing to the
              broader field of genetic studies and therapeutic target

              Modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, a
              comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions is necessary to determine how these genes
              influence complex traits. This insight is essential for developing
              new therapies. However, the current literature lacks an effective
              method for contextualizing genetic associations and identifying
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. To fill this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              consolidates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that by incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more
              nuanced understanding of genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene approaches, thereby
              advancing the broader field of complex trait research.

              Genes function in specific contexts through coordinated
              interactions. To understand how these genes impact complex traits,
              it is essential to comprehend their expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. Such knowledge is pivotal for the development
              of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in
              disease onset and progression. We found that diseases are
              significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
              examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              significant players lack associations but are prioritized in

              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for combined analysis. This representation is
              founded on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns
              under identical conditions. By incorporating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and uncover potential targets that single-gene
              strategies may overlook.

              In the field of functional genomics, the collective action of
              genes in specific contexts is critical for their function and
              influence on complex traits. Despite the recent advancements in
              transcriptome-wide association studies in revealing the role of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current understanding
              of gene-gene interactions, which are predicted to play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression, remains limited. This gap
              in knowledge hinders the development of new therapies and the
              understanding of disease etiology. In this study, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to fill this
              gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis, thereby providing a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. This approach
              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions, enabling us to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

              functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings not only provide valuable insights into disease etiology

              In the field of genomics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are key to disease origin and
              progression. However, existing methods fall short in capturing
              these interactions, leaving a gap in our understanding of disease
              mechanisms. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This model is based on modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across various
              conditions, thereby providing a more comprehensive view of
              gene-gene interactions. Our results reveal that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that important
              functional players lacking associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings underscore
              the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations
              and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. This advancement not only fills a critical gap in our
              understanding of disease mechanisms but also propels the field of
              genomics towards more effective therapeutic strategies.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across diverse conditions is essential to understanding how these
              genes influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for
              devising new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes
              in disease-related mechanisms. Contemporary models of complex
              traits' architecture, however, suggest that gene-gene interactions
              are integral to the onset and progression of diseases. We have
              found that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers action mechanisms. Moreover,
              through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we
              discovered that functionally significant players are not
              associated, but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation hinges on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. By including groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of gene expression regulation, the collective action
              of genes in specific contexts is crucial to their function and the
              manifestation of complex traits. Despite transcriptome-wide
              association studies illuminating the role of individual genes in
              disease mechanisms, current models predict gene-gene interactions
              as significant players in disease origin and progression, a gap
              unaddressed by single-gene strategies. This research introduces
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that fills this gap by
              mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is grounded on modules of co-expressed genes
              demonstrating similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and
              associates diseases significantly with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Notably, through a CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
              players lacking associations in trait-associated modules,
              revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Therefore, PhenoPLIER not only addresses the gap in understanding

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varied conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes influence complex traits. This understanding is vital for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in mechanisms relevant to disease. However, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions
              between genes are fundamental to the onset and progression of
              disease. We have found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation reveals that functionally significant players, although
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. By including groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding gene
              interactions and their influence on complex traits is vital for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease onset and progression, a
              perspective not fully addressed in current literature. This study
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. This
              representation is constructed on modules of co-expressed genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and

              genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach advances our
              understanding of complex trait architecture and could

              In the realm of genetic research, a comprehensive understanding of
              gene expression regulation across various conditions is pivotal
              for discerning how genes influence complex traits and,
              consequently, for the development of novel therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are instrumental in disease
              onset and progression, a crucial aspect not fully explored in the
              current literature. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
              premised on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and,
              through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveals that
              functionally important players, overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. The
              introduction of PhenoPLIER not only provides a more nuanced
              understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease progression but
              also unveils potential targets, thereby advancing the broader

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe
            that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

            that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
            data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies.

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of their expression
              regulation across varying conditions is crucial for understanding
              how these genes impact complex traits. This knowledge is vital for
              the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
              genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
              genes are pivotal in disease onset and progression. We note that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease combinations and infers action mechanisms.
              Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally significant elements
              lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. By including co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can

              The investigation of how genes interact to influence complex
              traits is a crucial aspect of functional genomics, yet our
              understanding of gene expression regulation across different
              conditions remains incomplete. This knowledge gap hinders the
              development of new therapies, particularly as modern models of
              complex traits underscore the importance of gene-gene interactions
              in disease etiology and progression. Existing transcriptome-wide
              association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes,
              but fall short in capturing the collective impact of gene modules
              expressed in disease-relevant cell types. In this study, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges
              this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This innovative method is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
              thereby incorporating co-expressed genes into the analysis. Our
              results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, it
              highlights functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules, as
              evidenced by a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. These
              findings underscore the power of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing
              genetic associations and identifying potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement not only
              enhances our understanding of disease etiology but also provides a
              robust tool for drug repurposing and the identification of new
              therapeutic targets, propelling the field of functional genomics
              forward.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact and
              influence complex traits is critical to developing new therapies.
              Current research has made significant strides in identifying the
              roles of individual genes through transcriptome-wide association
              studies. However, a gap exists in understanding how gene-gene
              interactions contribute to disease origin and progression, as
              predicted by modern models of complex trait architecture. This
              paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              designed to fill this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our

              address the open question of gene-gene interactions in disease

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to perform

              The field of genetic studies is steadily advancing towards a more
              comprehensive understanding of how genes interact in various
              contexts to influence complex traits. Despite significant
              progress, a gap exists in our understanding of gene-gene
              interactions and their role in disease origin and progression.
              This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic
              strategies. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that projects gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This innovative approach is
              predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions, thereby allowing for a more
              nuanced understanding of gene-gene interactions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              A CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation further highlighted
              that functionally important players, often overlooked in
              single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the potential of
              PhenoPLIER in uncovering the intricate gene-gene interactions
              involved in disease progression and drug mechanisms, thereby
              advancing the field of functional genomics and paving the way for
              targeted therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing.

              In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes operate
              collectively to influence complex traits under varying conditions
              is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest gene-gene
              interactions significantly impact disease onset and progression,
              highlighting a gap in our understanding of complex trait

              Genes work synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their roles. To comprehend how these genes impact complex traits,
              it is essential to understand the regulation of gene expression
              across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, current models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
              fundamental to disease onset and progression. We present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for combined analysis. This representation
              hinges on modules of genes showing similar expression patterns
              under identical conditions. By including groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can place genetic associations in context and
              identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.
              We found that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally significant players, though not
              directly associated, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER.

              The complex nature of diseases necessitates an in-depth
              understanding of the interactions between genes and their
              regulatory mechanisms under various conditions. Despite the
              valuable insights provided by transcriptome-wide association
              studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              existing research has yet to fully delve into the crucial role of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. This
              gap underscores the need for a more comprehensive model that can
              capture these interactions and their impact on complex traits. In
              this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational

              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified

              modules of co-expressed genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns under the same conditions, thereby providing a more

              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. Our findings reveal significant associations between

              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a gap
              remains in understanding how genes interact to influence complex
              traits and disease progression, a critical insight for developing
              new therapies. Current models predict that these gene-gene
              interactions are integral to disease origin and progression, yet
              modern methodologies often overlook these interactions, focusing
              instead on individual genes. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that consolidates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This

              expression patterns across identical conditions, enabling

              expressed in relevant cell types, and that PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              approach offers a new perspective on gene-gene interactions in

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their functions. A profound understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential for discerning how these
              genes impact complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have contributed to unveiling the role of individual genes
              in mechanisms related to disease. However, contemporary models of
              complex traits' architecture suggest that interactions between
              genes are pivotal in the genesis and progression of diseases. This
              paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a mutual latent representation for a
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is premised on modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              We note that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we
              discover that functionally significant players, though lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              While the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms has been
              explored through transcriptome-wide association studies, current
              research models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease onset and progression. However, the complex trait
              architecture and the mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions remain largely unexplored.
              This research gap hinders the development of new therapies and the
              identification of potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This model is

              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that while
              functionally important players may lack direct associations, they
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              study not only addresses the gap in our understanding of complex
              trait architecture and gene-gene interactions but also provides a
              robust method for identifying potential therapeutic targets,
              thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and drug
              repurposing.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits is key to developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease onset and
              progression, presenting a gap in our mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation. This approach, based on modules of
              co-expressed genes across similar conditions, allows for a
              comprehensive analysis, highlighting potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We found that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER successfully predicted known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation revealed that crucial functional
              players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings underscore the potential of
              PhenoPLIER in advancing our understanding of complex trait
              architecture and disease progression, providing a new avenue for
              the development of targeted therapies.

              Genes function together within specific contexts to carry out
              their roles. To understand how these genes affect complex traits,
              it is vital to comprehend the regulation of gene expression across
              various conditions. Such an understanding is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes
              are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that consolidates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating
              clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
              genetic associations and identify potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. We found that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by utilizing a
              CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant genes, although not directly associated,
              are prioritized in trait-related modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Within the field of functional genomics, the collective action of
              genes in specific contexts is essential for their functionality
              and influence on complex traits. Despite advancements in

              In the field of genetic research, it is widely understood that
              genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their functions, and that the regulation of gene expression across
              varying conditions is crucial for understanding complex traits.
              However, a gap exists in the current literature regarding the role
              of gene-gene interactions in the development and progression of
              diseases, as predicted by modern models of complex trait
              architecture. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach designed to bridge this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions, thus enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and highlight potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. Our results show significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for
              enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and for the
              development of new therapeutic strategies.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their functions. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of how
              these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions.
              This understanding is pivotal for the development of novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes
              are integral to the initiation and progression of diseases. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint

              can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              discovered that while functionally important players may lack
              associations, they are highlighted in trait-associated modules by

              The study of gene-gene interactions and their role in complex
              traits and diseases is a rapidly evolving field of research.
              Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
              onset and progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding
              of the mechanistic regulation of gene expression across different
              conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapeutic
              strategies. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This innovative method is based
              on modules of co-expressed genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across various conditions. By incorporating these gene
              groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations,
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally significant
              players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in

              bridge the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions in disease

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact to

              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are

              Genes function in synergy within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. To comprehend how these genes affect complex traits,
              we need to mechanistically understand expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. Such insight is vital for the development of
              new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been instrumental in exposing the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this manuscript, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This
              representation is devised based on modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns under identical conditions. By
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              provide context to genetic associations and uncover potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. We found that
              diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally significant players, despite lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              While genetic studies have elucidated the role of individual genes
              in disease mechanisms, understanding how genes interact in complex
              traits remains a significant challenge. This gap in knowledge
              hinders the development of novel therapies, as gene-gene
              interactions are predicted to play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. To address this issue, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
              established on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating these
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a context for genetic
              associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets that
              single-gene strategies may overlook. Our results demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
              discovered that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
              players that lack associations in trait-associated modules. This

              The complexity of genetic traits and their regulation poses a
              significant challenge in understanding disease origins and
              progression, with current research often focusing on individual
              genes and their roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              this approach overlooks the crucial role of gene-gene interactions
              predicted by modern models of complex trait architecture. Our
              research introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER operates on the
              principle of gene modules, groups of genes with similar expression
              patterns across various conditions, thereby providing a more
              holistic view of genetic associations. Our results indicate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

              functionally important players, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. These

              paving the way for the development of more targeted and effective

            find that functionally important players lack associations but are
            prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
