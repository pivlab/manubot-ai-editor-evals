          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. To understand how these genes impact complex traits, it is
          essential to comprehend the regulation of gene expression across
          various conditions. This understanding has been proven crucial in
          developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
          genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          vital for disease onset and progression. In this paper, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that consolidates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for a combined analysis. This representation is
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players, while
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
          uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          in different contexts to influence complex traits is crucial,
          particularly for developing new therapies. Despite advances in
          transcriptome-wide association studies, which have shed light on the
          roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, a gap
          remains in comprehending the significance of gene-gene interactions in
          disease origin and progression. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach designed to fill this gap. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for a joint analysis, based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. A CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation further
          underscores the importance of this approach, as it reveals that
          functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Ultimately,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby illuminating
          potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies and
          advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          The intricate interplay of genes in specific contexts is pivotal to
          their functionality, and understanding this complex relationship is
          critical for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are central to disease onset and progression, a
          nuanced aspect that remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge this gap
          by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for combined analysis, based
          on modules of genes expressing similar patterns across identical
          conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that functionally significant players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective for
          interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the potential of
          co-expressed gene groups and revealing potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of genetic
          interactions in disease mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to fulfill their
          functions. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          influence complex traits. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in mechanisms relevant
          to disease. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that interactions between genes play a pivotal role in the
          onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          In the broader field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
          influence complex traits has been a persistent challenge due to the
          intricate interplay of gene-gene interactions across diverse
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the current
          understanding of complex traits architecture suggests that
          interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression, a gap not yet fully addressed. Herein, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
          genes. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER has
          demonstrated its precision in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. In a case study employing a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation analysis, we found that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but
          are highlighted in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, thus revealing
          potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This innovative approach has the potential to reshape our
          understanding of complex trait architecture and expedite the discovery
          of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact in specific

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their functions. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is crucial to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. Such understanding is vital for the development
          of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          illuminated the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to the onset and
          progression of diseases. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for a
          comprehensive analysis. This representation is based on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen used to analyze lipid regulation
          revealed that functionally important elements, though lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Therefore,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the intricate
          interactions of genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal,
          necessitating a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This understanding is integral to the
          development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          instrumental in disease onset and progression - an aspect that remains
          inadequately explored. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that harmonizes gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across consistent conditions.
          Our results indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
          that functionally crucial elements, albeit lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, offers a
          fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations, potentially
          unveiling therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This novel approach propels the field of functional genomics forward,
          providing a new lens through which to view genetic associations in the
          context of gene modules.

          Within the broader field of genomics, the intricate interplay of
          gene-gene interactions and their role in complex traits is an area
          rich for exploration. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide
          association studies, which have elucidated the role of individual
          genes in disease mechanisms, there remains a gap in our understanding
          of how gene-gene interactions influence disease origin and
          progression. Our research aims to fill this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data for a comprehensive
          analysis. PhenoPLIER operates on a novel principle of mapping these
          associations into a common latent representation, based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across various conditions. Our results indicate a
          significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Further
          validation using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER could prioritize functionally important players that lack
          direct associations but are included in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new perspective for interpreting
          genetic associations, emphasizing the importance of gene modules over
          single-gene strategies. This innovative approach not only enhances our
          understanding of gene-gene interactions and complex traits but also
          holds potential for identifying previously overlooked therapeutic
          targets.

          Genes function in concert within specific contexts to perform their
          roles. A deeper understanding of how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across varied conditions. This knowledge is vital for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex traits'
          architecture suggest that interactions between genes are instrumental

          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation revealed that
          functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of gene interactions and their influence on complex traits
          is critical for understanding disease etiology and developing new
          therapies. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies,
          current models inadequately address the role of gene-gene interactions
          in disease origin and progression, thus creating a gap in our
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation, based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we found that while functionally
          important players may lack associations, they are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a significant advancement in our ability to interpret genetic
          associations, by contextualizing them through the lens of co-expressed
          gene modules. This not only fills a critical gap in our understanding
          of disease etiology but also uncovers potential therapeutic targets
          that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Within the broader field of genetic research, understanding how genes
          interact to influence complex traits is essential, particularly in the
          context of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest a critical role for gene-gene interactions, a
          facet not yet fully explored. This gap in our understanding hinders
          the development of new therapies, necessitating a more comprehensive
          approach. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes that exhibit
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Through the application of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          analysis, we discovered that functionally important genes, previously
          overlooked due to lack of associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          focusing on groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel way to
          interpret genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This finding has significant implications for
          advancing our understanding of genetic interactions and their role in
          disease progression.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          diverse conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
          that interactions between genes are vital in disease onset and
          progression. In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that translates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a combined
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally significant players often lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          offers a new perspective for understanding genetic associations

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          within specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential,
          especially for developing new therapies. Despite the advancements in
          transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering the roles of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current literature lacks
          an integrated model that can predict gene-gene interactions and their
          role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This advancement in understanding
          gene co-expression and its role in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms could open new avenues for therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing, thereby propelling the field of functional genomics
          forward.

          Within the broader field of genetic research, understanding how genes
          interact in various contexts to influence complex traits is crucial
          for developing new therapies. Despite the insights gleaned from
          transcriptome-wide association studies on individual gene roles in
          disease mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease onset
          and progression. This gap in our knowledge, the intricate interplay
          between genes, remains a key challenge. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for holistic analysis. This representation is
          anchored on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players, though
          lacking direct associations, are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, offers a new perspective on interpreting
          genetic associations, unmasking potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. This approach advances the field by providing
          a more nuanced understanding of the genetic underpinnings of complex
          traits and diseases.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. It is
          well-understood that genes interact within specific contexts to
          execute their functions, and discerning these interactions in relation
          to complex traits necessitates an in-depth understanding of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is crucial for
          the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role individual genes play
          in disease-associated mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          pivotal in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation
          is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

          interpreting genetic associations, offering insights into potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers
          an innovative framework for understanding genetic associations through
          the prism of gene modules.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          While recent genetic studies and transcriptome-wide association
          studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the role individual
          genes play in disease mechanisms, a significant gap remains in our
          understanding of how gene-gene interactions contribute to disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. This lack of insight into the complex
          architecture of these traits hinders our ability to develop effective
          therapies. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This approach is unique in that it is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various
          conditions, thus capturing the complexity of gene-gene interactions.
          Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players,
          although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings demonstrate
          that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER
          offers a significant advancement in functional genomics, providing a
          new framework for interpreting genetic associations and potentially
          accelerating drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic
          targets.

          Within the broader field of genomics, a critical gap exists in
          understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits and
          disease progression. This gap is particularly significant as it
          hinders the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have advanced our understanding of individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the
          crucial gene-gene interactions predicted by modern models of complex
          trait architecture. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          shared conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER is also accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, by applying PhenoPLIER to a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, provides a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations, contextualizes genetic
          associations, and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait
          architecture and disease progression.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes function
          collaboratively within specific contexts to carry out their roles. To
          understand how these genes affect complex traits, it is essential to
          grasp the regulation of expression across varying conditions. Such
          understanding is pivotal for the creation of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          elucidating the roles of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that interactions between genes are vital to the
          onset and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation hinges
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the
          same conditions. We have identified significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          revealed that functionally significant elements lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
          genes, can provide context to genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers a fresh approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          in disease etiology, a significant gap remains in our ability to
          unravel the complex interplay of gene-gene interactions and their
          impact on disease progression and drug mechanisms. This gap stems from
          the current focus on individual gene associations, overlooking the
          potential collective influence of gene modules, groups of genes with
          similar expression patterns across conditions. We address this gap
          with the introduction of PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our approach leverages the concept that genes operate
          synergistically in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          PhenoPLIER is built on the premise of gene modules, which are
          significantly associated with diseases when expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, it
          successfully prioritizes functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules, even those lacking direct associations, as
          evidenced by a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant step forward in the
          interpretation of genetic associations, highlighting the critical role
          of gene modules. By shifting the focus from individual genes to
          co-expressed gene groups, this approach has the potential to unearth
          novel therapeutic targets and advance drug repurposing efforts,
          thereby transforming our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the broader field of genetic research, understanding the role of
          genes in complex traits is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered
          individual gene roles, modern models suggest gene-gene interactions
          are critical in disease origin and progression. This highlights a gap
          in our understanding: the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across different conditions. To address this, we

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for a comprehensive analysis.
          Genes function in synergy within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is vital for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-specific mechanisms, contemporary models
          of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease onset and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is predicated on modules of genes that
          exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          find that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we employ a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, revealing that functionally significant players, though
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic
          associations, highlighting potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. It provides a fresh perspective for understanding genetic
          associations through the prism of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding the regulatory
          mechanisms of gene expression across different conditions is crucial
          for determining their influence on complex traits, and ultimately for
          developing new therapies. Despite the significant contributions of
          transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current literature
          suggests that gene-gene interactions have a substantial role in
          disease origin and progression, a factor not fully addressed by
          existing models. To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis, focusing on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns in the same conditions. Our results demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules,
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and, using a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation analysis, reveals functionally important
          players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, offering a
          more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and disease
          etiology. This approach, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, advancing the field of drug repurposing and therapeutic
          target discovery.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the field of genomics, understanding how genes influence complex
          traits is critical for developing new therapies, particularly in the
          context of gene-gene interactions and disease progression. Despite the
          insights gained from transcriptome-wide association studies, a gap
          remains in our understanding of gene-gene interactions and their role
          in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important
          players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach
          advances our understanding of the role of gene-gene interactions in
          disease progression and offers potential for the development of novel
          therapeutic strategies.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for a
          comprehensive joint analysis. Recognizing that genes operate
          synergistically within specific contexts, we aim to elucidate how
          these interactions influence complex traits by examining expression
          regulation under varying conditions. This understanding is essential
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's framework is grounded in modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          find that diseases have significant associations with gene modules
          expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting established drug-disease pairs and deducing mechanisms of
          action. By employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation,
          we discovered that functionally significant players, though lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER enhances the interpretation of
          genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          thereby unveiling potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER thus offers a unique approach for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          The field of genetic studies is increasingly recognizing the
          importance of understanding gene-gene interactions and their influence
          on complex traits, which is key to developing new therapies. Despite
          advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a gap remains in
          our ability to fully capture the complex architecture of these traits,
          particularly in relation to disease origin and progression. To address
          this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes that
          display similar expression patterns across various conditions, thereby
          enabling a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
          Notably, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
          associations but are included in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in
          interpreting genetic associations, contextualizing them through the
          lens of co-expressed gene modules. This approach not only fills a
          critical gap in our understanding of complex trait architecture, but
          also opens new avenues for identifying potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of complex trait research, a mechanistic understanding of
          gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential to
          comprehend how genes influence these traits and to develop new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          elucidated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          impact disease origin and progression, a facet not fully explored in
          existing literature. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation for comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER's unique
          representation is predicated on modules of genes that exhibit similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, our
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation indicates that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated
          modules, even when these players lack direct associations. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
          provides a powerful tool for contextualizing genetic associations and
          identifying potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This innovative approach advances our understanding of genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby propelling the
          field of complex trait research forward.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for
          joint analysis. Genes, acting in synchrony within specific contexts,
          perform their functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial to
          ascertain how these genes influence complex traits. This understanding
          is vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that interactions between genes are critical to
          the initiation and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's
          representation hinges on modules of genes that exhibit similar
          expression patterns under the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          analyzing lipid regulation reveals that crucial functional components
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          thus offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the perspective of gene modules.

          Within the broad field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a
          significant gap exists in understanding the role of gene co-expression
          in complex traits and disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have illuminated the role of individual genes, the
          current state-of-the-art recognizes that gene-gene interactions are
          crucial for disease origin and progression. This research introduces

          on interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This advancement
          in genetic studies and functional genomics could significantly enhance

          The study of complex traits and their associated diseases necessitates
          a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across
          varied conditions, a gap that current research is yet to fill. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression.
          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for a unified analysis. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded on
          modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings show that diseases are
          significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Notably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, offers a fresh perspective for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene modules, thereby revealing potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement could
          significantly enhance our understanding of complex traits and their
          associated diseases, propelling the field forward.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. Such insights have
          proven pivotal in the development of novel therapies. Our study
          findings indicate a significant association between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. In addition, we employed a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid
          regulation and discovered that functionally crucial players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by integrating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Consequently,
          PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          The current landscape of genetic studies and functional genomics
          recognizes the pivotal role of gene co-expression in complex traits
          and disease etiology, but struggles to fully elucidate the underlying
          mechanisms and their implications for therapeutic target
          identification and drug repurposing. This gap in understanding, which
          limits the development of novel therapies, is the focus of our
          research. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework

          indicated that functionally important players, although lacking direct

          In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes interact in
          specific contexts to influence complex traits is a critical yet
          underexplored area, particularly in relation to expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This gap in knowledge holds significant
          implications for the development of new therapies. Our study addresses
          this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations. Using our innovative approach, we found that diseases
          are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER proved accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We also applied
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, which highlighted that
          functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only provides a fresh

          Genes function in harmony within specific contexts to execute their
          roles. To comprehend how these genes affect complex traits, it is
          vital to understand the regulation of expression across various
          conditions mechanistically. This understanding has proven to be
          crucial for the creation of new therapies. Our study's findings
          indicate a significant association between diseases and gene modules
          that are expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method is
          precise in predicting established drug-disease pairs and deducing
          action mechanisms. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to
          scrutinize lipid regulation, revealing that functionally significant
          actors lack associations. However, they are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating
          clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets that single-gene
          strategies may overlook. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
          modules.

          The understanding of how genes interact and influence complex traits
          within specific contexts is a crucial gap in the field of functional
          genomics, particularly for the development of new therapies. Despite
          existing genetic studies, a comprehensive method to elucidate the
          regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions
          remains elusive. This study aims to address this gap by introducing a
          novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our results demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs, elucidating potential mechanisms of action.
          In a specific application, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
          lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, our findings illustrate that
          PhenoPLIER can identify potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, thereby providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
          This advancement in genetic studies and functional genomics not only
          enhances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms but
          also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of
          therapeutic targets.

          Within the broader field of genetics, a significant gap exists in
          understanding how genes interact within specific contexts to influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing effective
          therapies, yet current strategies often overlook key genetic players
          due to a single-gene focus. To address this, our research introduces a
          novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our findings reveal that
          diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          important players, often overlooked by traditional methods, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only provides a new framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules but also uncovers
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This advancement
          holds significant potential to move the field of genetics forward by

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence
          complex traits, achieved through the regulation of expression across
          diverse conditions, is crucial for the development of new therapies.
          Our study demonstrates that diseases have significant associations
          with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
          methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. In a further analysis of lipid regulation using
          a CRISPR screen, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a unique
          framework for interpreting genetic associations by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, thus revealing potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach provides an
          innovative perspective on genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          Within the broader field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a
          significant knowledge gap exists in understanding how genes
          collectively influence complex traits across different contexts. This
          mechanistic understanding of gene co-expression, pivotal for the
          development of new therapies, is often limited by the focus on
          single-gene strategies, thereby overlooking the potential targets that
          may be revealed through the interaction of gene modules. To address
          this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that while functionally important players may lack
          associations, they are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only provides a more
          comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations but also
          highlights potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This advancement in the understanding of gene
          co-expression and its role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          could potentially revolutionize the field of therapeutic targets and
          drug repurposing.

          Within the broader field of genetic research, a critical gap exists in
          understanding how genes collectively influence complex traits across
          various conditions, a knowledge crucial for developing new therapeutic
          strategies. Our research addresses this gap by introducing a novel
          approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes

          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known

          findings from a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveal that
          key functional players, though lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across diverse conditions is essential to understand how
          these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for
          the development of new therapeutic strategies. Our study demonstrates
          a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding how genes
          collectively influence complex traits is crucial, yet challenging, due
          to the necessity of a mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across varied conditions. This knowledge gap is
          particularly significant as it impedes the development of new
          therapies. To address this, we introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER,
          which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
          genetic associations. Our research reveals that diseases are
          significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Notably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action, demonstrating its potential in
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. A case study
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation further highlights
          the efficacy of PhenoPLIER in prioritizing functionally important
          players that lack associations in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances the interpretation of genetic
          associations by focusing on gene modules rather than single-gene
          strategies, thereby unveiling potential targets that could
          significantly impact the broader field of therapeutic development.

          The elucidation of gene interactions and their influence on complex
          traits is a critical yet poorly addressed aspect in the development of
          new therapies, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of
          expression regulation across varied conditions. This study introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework designed to interpret genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules. Our results demonstrate
          that diseases have significant associations with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach

          regulation reveals that functionally important players, often

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes

          crucial for the development of innovative therapies. Our study results
          indicate a significant association between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms

          In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics, a critical
          gap exists in deciphering how genes, acting in concert, influence
          complex traits across varied conditions, a key to developing new
          therapies. This study addresses this gap by using gene co-expression
          to project genetic associations, thereby elucidating disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms. Our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, incorporates
          groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations.
          The results demonstrate significant disease associations with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach has proven
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Notably, an analysis using a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players, often
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, PhenoPLIER not only
          provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations but
          also highlights potential therapeutic targets, advancing the field of
          drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetics, understanding the collaborative roles of
          genes in specific contexts is imperative for deciphering their
          influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. However, a
          significant gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of how gene
          expression is regulated across different conditions. Addressing this
          gap, our study introduces a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, in a CRISPR screen analysis
          of lipid regulation, functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only fills the existing gap
          in interpreting genetic associations but also unveils potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing the
          broader field of genetics.

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A detailed understanding of gene expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes
          influence complex traits. This knowledge is pivotal for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the function of individual genes
          in disease-related mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models of
          complex traits architecture suggest that interactions between genes
          play a vital role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant genes lack

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          the co-expression of genes under varying conditions is essential for
          discerning their influence on complex traits and disease etiology.
          Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. However, a
          gap exists in our ability to effectively map these interactions and
          their pharmacological implications. To address this, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation, based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal a
          significant association of diseases with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. An additional application of our approach in a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlighted functionally important players that
          were previously overlooked in associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER fills a critical
          gap in the field, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology,
          drug mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets, thus paving the
          way for drug repurposing and improved clustering of complex traits.

          In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes interact in
          specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. Despite the insights gained from
          transcriptome-wide association studies about individual gene roles in
          disease mechanisms, current models suggest gene-gene interactions are
          essential to disease origin and progression—a facet not yet fully
          explored. Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          designed to address this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis, focusing on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. An additional
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This research
          not only provides a novel approach to understanding gene-gene
          interactions in disease progression, but also advances the broader
          field by enhancing our capability to predict drug-disease
          relationships and discern mechanisms of action.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          While genes are known to interact in specific contexts to perform
          their functions, understanding how these interactions influence
          complex traits necessitates a deep comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across varying conditions, a crucial factor in developing
          new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          modern models of complex traits highlight the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease onset and progression, an area that remains
          underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for a comprehensive analysis. This representation is founded on
          modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our results reveal a significant association
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          demonstrating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important
          genes, though lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer
          the question of gene-gene interactions in disease development but also
          underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying
          therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing, thereby pushing
          the boundaries of functional genomics.

          Within the broader field of genomics, understanding how genes interact
          to influence complex traits is a critical challenge. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest
          a significant role for gene-gene interactions in the onset and
          progression of disease. This presents a gap in our current
          understanding and methodological approach, as it is crucial for the
          development of novel therapies. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          constructed around modules of genes that exhibit similar expression
          patterns across various conditions. Our results indicate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. PhenoPLIER exhibits accuracy in predicting known

          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for understanding complex disease
          mechanisms and indicate a significant step forward in the field of
          genomics.

          Genes operate symbiotically within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation
          across various conditions is essential for discerning how these genes
          affect complex traits. Such insight is pivotal for the creation of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the roles of individual genes within
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are vital
          to the onset and progression of diseases. In this paper, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that amalgamates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a single
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation hinges
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          identical conditions. We found that diseases have a significant
          correlation with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen used to examine lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally significant genes may lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The complexity of genetic interactions and their role in disease
          etiology remains a significant gap in our understanding of functional
          genomics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
          elucidated the roles of individual genes, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          designed to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a joint analysis. This mapping
          is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER demonstrated high accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings
          underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool in identifying
          therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs, thereby advancing the field
          of functional genomics.

          In the field of genomics, understanding how genes interact in specific
          contexts to influence complex traits is fundamental to developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet underrepresented in
          current research. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that harmonizes gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
          representation. This representation is predicated on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that functionally important players, although
          lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by our approach. These findings not only answer the question
          of gene-gene interaction's role in disease progression, but also pave
          the way for a deeper understanding of the genomic underpinnings of
          complex traits, thereby advancing the broader field of genomics.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their functions. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is imperative to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in mechanisms
          relevant to disease. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal
          in the genesis and progression of disease. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. We discovered that
          diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types, and our methodology demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and deducing mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, applying a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          revealed that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          While it is well established that genes operate synergistically in
          specific contexts to fulfill their roles, the mechanistic
          understanding of their expression regulation across varying conditions
          remains a challenge for elucidating complex traits and developing new
          therapies. Despite transcriptome-wide association studies shedding
          light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, current models
          of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          pivotal in disease onset and progression. This study introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a
          significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
          screen to assess lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          crucial players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the
          potential of PhenoPLIER in identifying therapeutic targets and
          advancing drug repurposing, thereby contributing to the broader field
          of functional genomics and complex trait clustering.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Within the broader field of gene expression regulation, the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms has been elucidated
          through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, a gap exists
          in our understanding of how gene-gene interactions contribute to
          complex trait architecture and disease progression. This paper
          addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER maps these
          associations into a latent representation based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our
          results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated
          that functionally important genes, though lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
          findings not only provide a deeper understanding of gene-gene
          interactions in disease progression but also offer a new approach for
          identifying potential therapeutic targets, thus advancing the field of
          gene expression regulation.

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to fulfill
          their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a deep comprehension of expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the involvement of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          traits architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral
          to the onset and progression of diseases. In this paper, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for comprehensive analysis. This representation
          is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          in identical conditions. We discovered that diseases are significantly
          correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and
          our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, when using a CRISPR screen to
          examine lipid regulation, we determined that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The field of functional genomics seeks to understand the complex
          interplay of genes in different contexts and conditions, and their
          influence on complex traits. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide
          association studies, a gap remains in understanding the role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, a critical
          aspect for developing new therapies. This manuscript introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to address this
          gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. In a case study using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players, previously lacking associations, were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This demonstrates PhenoPLIER’s
          potential to enhance our understanding of complex traits and disease
          etiology, and to identify novel therapeutic targets and strategies for
          drug repurposing. Our work, therefore, not only fills a critical gap
          in the field of functional genomics, but also has broader significance
          for genetic studies and the development of new therapies.

          Within the broader field of genomics, the interplay of genes and their
          collective influence on complex traits is a critical area of study,
          particularly for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current literature lacks
          comprehensive models that account for gene-gene interactions, which
          are predicted to be pivotal in disease origin and progression. To fill
          this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          innovative method hinges on the identification of gene modules, groups
          of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
          conditions. Our results reveal significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          proves accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deducing
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation indicates that while some functionally important genes lack
          direct associations, they are prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. This conclusion not only answers the initial question
          of gene-gene interactions in disease progression but also advances the
          broader field by providing a novel approach to understanding complex
          trait architecture and disease mechanisms.

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to carry out
              their functions. To understand how these genes impact complex
              traits, it is essential to comprehend the regulation of gene
              expression across various conditions. This understanding has been
              proven crucial in developing new therapeutic strategies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that interactions between genes are vital for
              disease onset and progression. In this paper, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that consolidates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for a combined analysis. This representation
              is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns under identical conditions. We find that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant players, while lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact in different contexts to influence complex traits is
              crucial, particularly for developing new therapies. Despite
              advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, which have
              shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, a gap remains in comprehending the significance of
              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. This
              study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to
              fill this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for a joint analysis, based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              further underscores the importance of this approach, as it reveals
              that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby illuminating potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies and advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              The intricate interplay of genes in specific contexts is pivotal
              to their functionality, and understanding this complex
              relationship is critical for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are central to disease onset
              and progression, a nuanced aspect that remains largely unexplored.
              This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              designed to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for combined analysis, based on modules of genes
              expressing similar patterns across identical conditions. Our
              results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              reveals that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective
              for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the potential
              of co-expressed gene groups and revealing potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our
              understanding of genetic interactions in disease mechanisms.

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to fulfill their
              functions. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
              regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand
              how these genes influence complex traits. This understanding is
              crucial for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in mechanisms relevant to disease. However, contemporary

              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent

              In the broader field of functional genomics, understanding how
              genes influence complex traits has been a persistent challenge due
              to the intricate interplay of gene-gene interactions across
              diverse conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms,
              the current understanding of complex traits architecture suggests
              that interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression, a gap not yet fully addressed. Herein, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap
              by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes. Our results indicate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER has demonstrated its precision in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. In a case study employing a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation analysis, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              highlighted in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic
              associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, thus
              revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. This innovative approach has the potential to reshape
              our understanding of complex trait architecture and expedite the
              discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
              opportunities.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact in
              specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key to disease
              origin and progression, a gap yet to be fully explored. This study

              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms

              regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
              associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the intricate
              interactions of genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal,
              necessitating a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation
              across varying conditions. This understanding is integral to the
              development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are instrumental in disease onset and progression -
              an aspect that remains inadequately explored. To address this gap,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that harmonizes
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across consistent conditions. Our results
              indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally crucial elements, albeit lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of co-expressed
              genes, offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic
              associations, potentially unveiling therapeutic targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies. This novel approach propels the field
              of functional genomics forward, providing a new lens through which

              Within the broader field of genomics, the intricate interplay of
              gene-gene interactions and their role in complex traits is an area
              rich for exploration. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide
              association studies, which have elucidated the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, there remains a gap in our
              understanding of how gene-gene interactions influence disease
              origin and progression. Our research aims to fill this gap by
              introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for
              a comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER operates on a novel principle
              of mapping these associations into a common latent representation,
              based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions.
              Our results indicate a significant correlation between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Further validation using a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER could prioritize
              functionally important players that lack direct associations but
              are included in trait-associated modules. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations, emphasizing the importance of gene modules over
              single-gene strategies. This innovative approach not only enhances
              our understanding of gene-gene interactions and complex traits but
              also holds potential for identifying previously overlooked
              therapeutic targets.

              Genes function in concert within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A deeper understanding of how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across varied conditions. This knowledge is
              vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              of complex traits' architecture suggest that interactions between
              genes are instrumental in disease onset and progression. In this
              paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is based on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
              examine lipid regulation revealed that functionally significant
              players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER,
              by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize

              single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for

              traits is critical for understanding disease etiology and

              This gap in our understanding hinders the development of new
              therapies, necessitating a more comprehensive approach. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes that exhibit
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Through the application of a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation analysis, we discovered that functionally important
              genes, previously overlooked due to lack of associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by focusing on groups of co-expressed
              genes, provides a novel way to interpret genetic associations,
              revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              finding has significant implications for advancing our
              understanding of genetic interactions and their role in disease
              progression.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development
              of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact within specific contexts to influence complex traits is
              essential, especially for developing new therapies. Despite the
              advancements in transcriptome-wide association studies in
              uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              the current literature lacks an integrated model that can predict
              gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and

              Within the broader field of genetic research, understanding how
              genes interact in various contexts to influence complex traits is
              crucial for developing new therapies. Despite the insights gleaned
              from transcriptome-wide association studies on individual gene
              roles in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              impact disease onset and progression. This gap in our knowledge,
              the intricate interplay between genes, remains a key challenge. To
              address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for holistic analysis. This representation is
              anchored on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
              functionally important players, though lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, offers a new perspective on interpreting
              genetic associations, unmasking potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This approach advances the field by
              providing a more nuanced understanding of the genetic
              underpinnings of complex traits and diseases.

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. It is well-understood that genes interact
              within specific contexts to execute their functions, and
              discerning these interactions in relation to complex traits
              necessitates an in-depth understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the
              development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role individual genes
              play in disease-associated mechanisms. However, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions
              between genes are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is built upon modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions.
              We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters
              of co-expressed genes, provides a fresh perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations, offering insights into
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
              PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for understanding
              genetic associations through the prism of gene modules.

              While recent genetic studies and transcriptome-wide association
              studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the role
              individual genes play in disease mechanisms, a significant gap
              remains in our understanding of how gene-gene interactions
              contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This lack of
              insight into the complex architecture of these traits hinders our
              ability to develop effective therapies. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is unique in that it is based on modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across various
              conditions, thus capturing the complexity of gene-gene
              interactions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

              findings demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement
              in functional genomics, providing a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations and potentially accelerating drug repurposing
              and the identification of therapeutic targets.

              Within the broader field of genomics, a critical gap exists in
              understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits and
              disease progression. This gap is particularly significant as it
              hinders the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have advanced our understanding of individual
              genes' roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing
              the crucial gene-gene interactions predicted by modern models of
              complex trait architecture. To address this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap
              by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

              exhibiting similar expression patterns across shared conditions.

              genetic associations, and uncovers potential targets missed by

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. Genes function collaboratively within specific
              contexts to carry out their roles. To understand how these genes
              affect complex traits, it is essential to grasp the regulation of
              expression across varying conditions. Such understanding is
              pivotal for the creation of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the
              roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
              Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
              suggest that interactions between genes are vital to the onset and
              progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation hinges on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the
              same conditions. We have identified significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
              significant elements lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER,
              by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can provide
              context to genetic associations and uncover potential targets that
              single-gene strategies may overlook. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a
              fresh approach to interpreting genetic associations through the
              perspective of gene modules.

              Despite advances in understanding genetic associations and their
              role in disease etiology, a significant gap remains in our ability
              to unravel the complex interplay of gene-gene interactions and
              their impact on disease progression and drug mechanisms. This gap
              stems from the current focus on individual gene associations,
              overlooking the potential collective influence of gene modules,
              groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
              conditions. We address this gap with the introduction of
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach
              leverages the concept that genes operate synergistically in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. PhenoPLIER is built
              on the premise of gene modules, which are significantly associated
              with diseases when expressed in relevant cell types. Our findings
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, it successfully
              prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules, even those lacking direct associations, as evidenced by a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER offers a significant step forward in the interpretation
              of genetic associations, highlighting the critical role of gene
              modules. By shifting the focus from individual genes to
              co-expressed gene groups, this approach has the potential to
              unearth novel therapeutic targets and advance drug repurposing
              efforts, thereby transforming our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In the broader field of genetic research, understanding the role
              of genes in complex traits is crucial for the development of new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered individual gene roles, modern models suggest gene-gene
              interactions are critical in disease origin and progression. This
              highlights a gap in our understanding: the need for a mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation across different

              contexts, and understanding their influence on complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              under varying conditions. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-specific mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is predicated on modules of genes that exhibit
              similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we employ a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, revealing that functionally significant players,
              though lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
              clusters of co-expressed genes, offers a unique framework for
              interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. It provides a fresh
              perspective for understanding genetic associations through the
              prism of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across different conditions is
              crucial for determining their influence on complex traits, and
              ultimately for developing new therapies. Despite the significant
              contributions of transcriptome-wide association studies in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the
              current literature suggests that gene-gene interactions have a
              substantial role in disease origin and progression, a factor not
              fully addressed by existing models. To fill this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, focusing on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns in the same conditions. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with these gene modules, expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers
              mechanisms of action, and, using a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation analysis, reveals functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, offering a
              more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and disease
              etiology. This approach, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies, advancing the field of drug repurposing
              and therapeutic target discovery.

              In the field of genomics, understanding how genes influence
              complex traits is critical for developing new therapies,
              particularly in the context of gene-gene interactions and disease
              progression. Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide
              association studies, a gap remains in our understanding of
              gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and
              progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data for a comprehensive joint analysis. Recognizing
              that genes operate synergistically within specific contexts, we
              aim to elucidate how these interactions influence complex traits
              by examining expression regulation under varying conditions. This
              understanding is essential for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's framework is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find
              that diseases have significant associations with gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method demonstrates
              accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and deducing
              mechanisms of action. By employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
              players, though lacking associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              enhances the interpretation of genetic associations by
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups, thereby unveiling
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              thus offers a unique approach for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

              The field of genetic studies is increasingly recognizing the
              importance of understanding gene-gene interactions and their
              influence on complex traits, which is key to developing new
              therapies. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association
              studies, a gap remains in our ability to fully capture the complex
              architecture of these traits, particularly in relation to disease
              origin and progression. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method is
              based on modules of genes that display similar expression patterns
              across various conditions, thereby enabling a more comprehensive
              understanding of gene interactions. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicted known
              drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Notably, our
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
              associations but are included in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in
              interpreting genetic associations, contextualizing them through
              the lens of co-expressed gene modules. This approach not only
              fills a critical gap in our understanding of complex trait
              architecture, but also opens new avenues for identifying potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the realm of complex trait research, a mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation across different
              conditions is essential to comprehend how genes influence these
              traits and to develop new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes
              in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression,
              a facet not fully explored in existing literature. To address this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER's unique representation is
              predicated on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that
              diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, our
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation indicates that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules, even when these players lack direct
              associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes, provides a powerful tool for contextualizing
              genetic associations and identifying potential targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies. This innovative approach advances our
              understanding of genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby propelling the field of complex trait research
              forward.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for
              joint analysis. Genes, acting in synchrony within specific
              contexts, perform their functions. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial to
              ascertain how these genes influence complex traits. This
              understanding is vital for the development of new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions
              between genes are critical to the initiation and progression of
              diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation hinges on modules of genes
              that exhibit similar expression patterns under the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation reveals that crucial functional components lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters
              of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER thus offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the perspective of gene modules.

              Within the broad field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              a significant gap exists in understanding the role of gene
              co-expression in complex traits and disease etiology. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the role
              of individual genes, the current state-of-the-art recognizes that
              gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and
              progression. This research introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that fills this gap by mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. For instance, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that functionally important players, which
              lacked associations, were prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, offers a new perspective on interpreting
              genetic associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This advancement in genetic
              studies and functional genomics could significantly enhance drug
              repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, propelling the
              field forward.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

              The study of complex traits and their associated diseases
              necessitates a comprehensive understanding of gene expression
              regulation across varied conditions, a gap that current research
              is yet to fill. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for
              disease origin and progression. This study introduces PhenoPLIER,
              a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for a unified analysis.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded on modules of genes
              displaying similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly
              linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Notably,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players
              lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, offers a fresh perspective for interpreting
              genetic associations through gene modules, thereby revealing
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              advancement could significantly enhance our understanding of
              complex traits and their associated diseases, propelling the field
              forward.

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these
              genes affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions.
              Such insights have proven pivotal in the development of novel
              therapies. Our study findings indicate a significant association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
              types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In addition,
              we employed a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid regulation and
              discovered that functionally crucial players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by integrating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              Consequently, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
              modules.

              The current landscape of genetic studies and functional genomics
              recognizes the pivotal role of gene co-expression in complex
              traits and disease etiology, but struggles to fully elucidate the
              underlying mechanisms and their implications for therapeutic
              target identification and drug repurposing. This gap in
              understanding, which limits the development of novel therapies, is
              the focus of our research. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a novel framework that interprets genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Interestingly, a CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation indicated that functionally
              important players, although lacking direct associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              findings suggest that PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations,
              revealing potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER not only addresses the
              existing gap in understanding gene co-expression and its impact on
              complex traits, but also paves the way for significant
              advancements in the broader field of functional genomics and drug

              In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes interact
              in specific contexts to influence complex traits is a critical yet
              underexplored area, particularly in relation to expression
              regulation across varying conditions. This gap in knowledge holds
              significant implications for the development of new therapies. Our
              study addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel
              framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations. Using our innovative approach,
              we found that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER proved
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. We also applied a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation, which highlighted that functionally important
              players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our results
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only provides a fresh perspective
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, but also uncovers potential targets that single-gene
              strategies may overlook, thus advancing the broader field of
              genetic research.

              Genes function in harmony within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. To comprehend how these genes affect complex traits,
              it is vital to understand the regulation of expression across
              various conditions mechanistically. This understanding has proven
              to be crucial for the creation of new therapies. Our study's
              findings indicate a significant association between diseases and
              gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover,
              our method is precise in predicting established drug-disease pairs
              and deducing action mechanisms. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant actors lack associations. However, they are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              provide context to genetic associations and uncover potential
              targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. Thus, PhenoPLIER
              offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the perspective of gene modules.

              The understanding of how genes interact and influence complex
              traits within specific contexts is a crucial gap in the field of
              functional genomics, particularly for the development of new
              therapies. Despite existing genetic studies, a comprehensive
              method to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
              across various conditions remains elusive. This study aims to
              address this gap by introducing a novel approach, PhenoPLIER,
              which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs, elucidating potential mechanisms of action. In
              a specific application, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
              lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, our findings illustrate that
              PhenoPLIER can identify potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies, thereby providing a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. This advancement in genetic studies and functional
              genomics not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms but also opens new avenues for drug
              repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets.

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits, achieved through the regulation of
              expression across diverse conditions, is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases
              have significant associations with gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              In a further analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen,
              we discovered that functionally significant players, although
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework
              for interpreting genetic associations by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, thus revealing potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This approach provides an innovative
              perspective on genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules.

              Within the broader field of genetic studies and functional
              genomics, a significant knowledge gap exists in understanding how
              genes collectively influence complex traits across different
              contexts. This mechanistic understanding of gene co-expression,
              pivotal for the development of new therapies, is often limited by
              the focus on single-gene strategies, thereby overlooking the
              potential targets that may be revealed through the interaction of
              gene modules. To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a
              novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that while
              functionally important players may lack associations, they are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only provides a more comprehensive
              interpretation of genetic associations but also highlights
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. This advancement in the understanding of gene
              co-expression and its role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms
              could potentially revolutionize the field of therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              collectively influence complex traits is crucial, yet challenging,
              due to the necessity of a mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation across varied conditions. This knowledge gap
              is particularly significant as it impedes the development of new
              therapies. To address this, we introduce a novel approach,
              PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations. Our research reveals that
              diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Notably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, demonstrating
              its potential in therapeutic target identification and drug
              repurposing. A case study using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation further highlights the efficacy of PhenoPLIER in
              prioritizing functionally important players that lack associations
              in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
              the interpretation of genetic associations by focusing on gene
              modules rather than single-gene strategies, thereby unveiling
              potential targets that could significantly impact the broader
              field of therapeutic development.

              The elucidation of gene interactions and their influence on
              complex traits is a critical yet poorly addressed aspect in the
              development of new therapies, necessitating a comprehensive
              understanding of expression regulation across varied conditions.
              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel framework designed to
              interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
              Our results demonstrate that diseases have significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Intriguingly, our CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
              important players, often overlooked by single-gene strategies, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER's unique ability to incorporate groups of
              co-expressed genes and contextualize genetic associations uncovers
              potential targets that may have otherwise been missed, thereby
              advancing our understanding of gene interactions and their
              influence on complex traits.

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of
              expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
              crucial for the development of innovative therapies. Our study
              results indicate a significant association between diseases and
              gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. In addition, our use of a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation reveals that while functionally
              important players may lack associations, they are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER,
              by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, can provide context
              to genetic associations and uncover potential targets that
              single-gene strategies may overlook. Therefore, PhenoPLIER offers
              a novel approach for interpreting genetic associations through the
              perspective of gene modules.

              In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics, a
              critical gap exists in deciphering how genes, acting in concert,
              influence complex traits across varied conditions, a key to
              developing new therapies. This study addresses this gap by using
              gene co-expression to project genetic associations, thereby
              elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our novel
              approach, PhenoPLIER, incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations. The results demonstrate
              significant disease associations with gene modules expressed in

              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

              In the field of genetics, understanding the collaborative roles of
              genes in specific contexts is imperative for deciphering their
              influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. However,
              a significant gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of how
              gene expression is regulated across different conditions.
              Addressing this gap, our study introduces a novel approach,
              PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been

              Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A detailed understanding of gene expression
              regulation across varying conditions is essential to elucidate how
              these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is pivotal
              for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the
              function of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models of complex traits architecture
              suggest that interactions between genes play a vital role in
              disease onset and progression. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              under identical conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              significant genes lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding the co-expression of genes under varying conditions
              is essential for discerning their influence on complex traits and
              disease etiology. Although transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes, contemporary
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
              onset and progression. However, a gap exists in our ability to
              effectively map these interactions and their pharmacological
              implications. To address this, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation, based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results
              reveal a significant association of diseases with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. An additional application of our
              approach in a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted
              functionally important players that were previously overlooked in
              associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER fills a critical gap in the field,
              enhancing our understanding of disease etiology, drug mechanisms,
              and potential therapeutic targets, thus paving the way for drug
              repurposing and improved clustering of complex traits.

              In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes interact
              in specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for
              the development of new therapies. Despite the insights gained from
              transcriptome-wide association studies about individual gene roles
              in disease mechanisms, current models suggest gene-gene
              interactions are essential to disease origin and progression—a
              facet not yet fully explored. Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach designed to address this gap. PhenoPLIER
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis, focusing
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings indicate significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known

              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This research not only provides a novel approach to
              understanding gene-gene interactions in disease progression, but
              also advances the broader field by enhancing our capability to
              predict drug-disease relationships and discern mechanisms of
              action.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their functions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across various conditions is crucial to comprehend how
              these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for
              the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, current models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes
              are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is constructed on modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found
              that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally significant players, though lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              While genes are known to interact in specific contexts to perform
              their functions, understanding how these interactions influence
              complex traits necessitates a deep comprehension of gene
              expression regulation across varying conditions, a crucial factor
              in developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits
              highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              onset and progression, an area that remains underexplored. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for a comprehensive analysis. This representation
              is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal a
              significant association between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating PhenoPLIER's
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation reveals that functionally important genes, though
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of
              gene-gene interactions in disease development but also underscore
              the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying therapeutic
              targets and advancing drug repurposing, thereby pushing the
              boundaries of functional genomics.

              Within the broader field of genomics, understanding how genes
              interact to influence complex traits is a critical challenge.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided

              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are vital to the onset and progression
              of diseases. In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that amalgamates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a single latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation hinges on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
              identical conditions. We found that diseases have a significant
              correlation with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen used to examine
              lipid regulation revealed that functionally significant genes may
              lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER.

              etiology remains a significant gap in our understanding of

              In the field of genomics, understanding how genes interact in
              specific contexts to influence complex traits is fundamental to
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression, a
              facet underrepresented in current research. To address this gap,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              harmonizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This
              representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting

              the genomic underpinnings of complex traits, thereby advancing the

              While it is well established that genes operate synergistically in

              Within the broader field of gene expression regulation, the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms has been
              elucidated through transcriptome-wide association studies.
              However, a gap exists in our understanding of how gene-gene
              interactions contribute to complex trait architecture and disease
              progression. This paper addresses this gap by introducing
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for
              joint analysis. PhenoPLIER maps these associations into a latent
              representation based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across various conditions. Our results reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that
              functionally important genes, though lacking direct associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings not only provide a deeper understanding of gene-gene
              interactions in disease progression but also offer a new approach
              for identifying potential therapeutic targets, thus advancing the
              field of gene expression regulation.

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to fulfill
              their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a deep comprehension of expression regulation across
              varying conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in revealing the involvement of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex traits architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              are integral to the onset and progression of diseases. In this
              paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is founded on modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns in identical
              conditions. We discovered that diseases are significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types,
              and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, when using a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, we determined that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The field of functional genomics seeks to understand the complex
              interplay of genes in different contexts and conditions, and their
              influence on complex traits. Despite advances in
              transcriptome-wide association studies, a gap remains in
              understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin
              and progression, a critical aspect for developing new therapies.
              This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach designed to address this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. In a case study using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players,
              previously lacking associations, were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This demonstrates
              PhenoPLIER’s potential to enhance our understanding of complex
              traits and disease etiology, and to identify novel therapeutic
              targets and strategies for drug repurposing. Our work, therefore,
              not only fills a critical gap in the field of functional genomics,
              but also has broader significance for genetic studies and the
              development of new therapies.

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Within the broader field of genomics, the interplay of genes and
              their collective influence on complex traits is a critical area of
              study, particularly for the development of new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current literature
              lacks comprehensive models that account for gene-gene
              interactions, which are predicted to be pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. This innovative method
              hinges on the identification of gene modules, groups of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions.
              Our results reveal significant associations between diseases and
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deducing
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation indicates that while some functionally important genes
              lack direct associations, they are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This conclusion not only answers the
              initial question of gene-gene interactions in disease progression
              but also advances the broader field by providing a novel approach
              to understanding complex trait architecture and disease
              mechanisms.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").
