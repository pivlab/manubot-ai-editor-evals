However, a gap exists in our understanding of how these genes function in concert across different conditions, and this mechanistic insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This innovative method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, our approach prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules that lack associations, as demonstrated using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel method to contextualize genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This research contributes significantly to the broader field by offering a new tool to understand how co-expressed genes influence complex traits, thereby advancing our capacity to develop effective therapies.

In the realm of genetic research, a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is pivotal for discerning how genes influence complex traits and, consequently, for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are instrumental in disease onset and progression, a crucial aspect not fully explored in the current literature. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is premised on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveals that functionally important players, overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. The introduction of PhenoPLIER not only provides a more nuanced understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease progression but also unveils potential targets, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic research and therapeutic development.

Our research introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER operates on the principle of gene modules, groups of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, thereby providing a more holistic view of genetic associations. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, even identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. A practical application of PhenoPLIER in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to advance our understanding of complex genetic traits and disease mechanisms, paving the way for the development of more targeted and effective therapies.
