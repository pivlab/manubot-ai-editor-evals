          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key to
          understanding complex traits. However, a gap exists in our ability to
          effectively map these interactions and their implications for disease
          and drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
          functionally important genes, although lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing a
          more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. This approach could potentially identify therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, advancing the field of
          functional genomics.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          in specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial,
          particularly for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          This highlights a gap in our understanding of the complex architecture
          of gene interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
          this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally important genes, although lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby revealing
          potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This advancement could significantly enhance our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, propelling the field of
          functional genomics forward.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          in specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial,
          particularly for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          This highlights a gap in our understanding of the complex architecture
          of traits and the need for a more comprehensive approach. In this
          study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
          important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a unique approach to interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, thereby providing a more holistic view of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach could potentially
          identify therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies,
          advancing the field of genetic studies and drug repurposing.

          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          in specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial,
          particularly for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          This highlights a gap in our understanding of the complex architecture
          of traits and the need for a more comprehensive approach. In this
          study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes,
          although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize these
          associations and identify potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. This advancement could significantly enhance
          our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, propelling
          the field of functional genomics forward.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic
          strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex

          insights into potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic
          strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to
          disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that functionally significant players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, offering insights into potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

          genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach advances our understanding of complex trait clustering and
          offers new avenues for drug repurposing.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach advances our understanding of complex trait clustering and
          offers new avenues for drug repurposing.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a detailed

          offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach advances our understanding of complex trait clustering and
          offers new avenues for drug repurposing.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the
          creation of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases have
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we employed a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing
          that functionally crucial players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an
          innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the
          creation of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases have
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we employed a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing
          that functionally crucial players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
          provide context to genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an
          innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
          understanding how genes, acting in concert, influence complex traits
          across different conditions. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapies. To address this, we have developed a
          novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our study reveals that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only provides a new framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, but also highlights
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This advancement could significantly propel the field of
          genetic studies and drug repurposing forward.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
          understanding how genes, acting in concert, influence complex traits
          across different conditions, a knowledge crucial for developing new
          therapies. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, reveal that functionally important players, although
          lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, provides a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations, contextualizing them, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may
          overlook. This approach advances the broader field by offering a more
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the
          creation of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases have
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and deduces mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that
          functionally crucial players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
          provide context to genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an
          innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
          understanding how genes, acting in concert, influence complex traits
          across different conditions, a knowledge crucial for developing new
          therapies. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, reveal that functionally important players, although
          lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, provides a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations, contextualizing them, and revealing
          potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may
          overlook. This approach advances the broader field by offering a more
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are critical in the onset and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the complex
          architecture of gene interactions and their role in disease etiology.
          To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
          important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results not only
          enhance our understanding of disease etiology but also provide a
          robust tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the field of functional
          genomics.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development
          of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex

          PhenoPLIER.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide association
          studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
          origin and progression, a facet not yet fully explored. This study
          introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges
          this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
          important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results not only answer
          the question of gene-gene interaction's role in disease progression
          but also advance the field by providing a new tool for identifying
          therapeutic targets and potential drug repurposing opportunities.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are vital in disease onset and progression. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide association
          studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
          origin and progression, a facet not fully explored. This gap in
          knowledge hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These results underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER in
          elucidating complex trait etiology and identifying therapeutic
          targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and paving
          the way for effective drug repurposing.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between

          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
          origin and progression, a facet not yet fully explored. This gap in
          knowledge hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated
          that functionally important genes, although lacking direct
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These results not only answer the question of gene-gene
          interaction's role in disease progression but also highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER in identifying therapeutic targets and
          advancing drug repurposing, thereby pushing the boundaries of genetic
          studies and functional genomics.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are critical in the onset and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide association
          studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease
          origin and progression, a facet not fully explored. This gap in
          knowledge hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only enhance our understanding of
          disease etiology but also provide a robust platform for identifying
          therapeutic targets and potential drug repurposing, thereby advancing
          the field of genetic studies.

            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
              genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally important genes lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in
              the context of disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are key to understanding complex traits. However, a
              gap exists in our ability to effectively map these interactions
              and their implications for disease and drug mechanisms. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation revealed that functionally important genes, although
              lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
              gene modules, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding
              of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach could
              potentially identify therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, advancing the field of functional genomics.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact in specific contexts to influence complex traits is
              crucial, particularly for the development of new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the
              complex architecture of gene interactions and their role in
              disease etiology. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important genes, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby revealing potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement could
              significantly enhance our understanding of disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms, propelling the field of functional genomics
              forward.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their

              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual
              genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally important genes lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the perspective of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact in specific contexts to influence complex traits is
              crucial, particularly for the development of new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the
              complex architecture of traits and the need for a more
              comprehensive approach. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
              important genes, although lacking direct associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a unique approach to interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
              providing a more holistic view of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This approach could potentially identify therapeutic
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, advancing the field
              of genetic studies and drug repurposing.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. Genes function synergistically within
              specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are critical in disease onset and

              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation showed that
              functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach advances our understanding of complex trait
              clustering and offers new avenues for drug repurposing.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. Genes function synergistically within
              specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex

              regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              revealed that functionally important players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach advances our understanding of complex trait
              clustering and offers new avenues for drug repurposing.

              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. Genes function synergistically within
              specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is predicated on modules
              of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              reveals that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, offering insights into potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies.

            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the creation of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases have significant associations with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employed a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing that
              functionally crucial players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the perspective of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
              understanding how genes, acting in concert, influence complex
              traits across different conditions. This understanding is pivotal
              for the development of new therapies. To address this, we have
              developed a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups
              of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our
              study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR
              screen indicates that functionally important players, although
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only provides a new
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, but also highlights potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement
              could significantly propel the field of genetic studies and drug
              repurposing forward.

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the perspective of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
              understanding how genes, acting in concert, influence complex
              traits across different conditions, a knowledge crucial for
              developing new therapies. This study addresses this gap by
              demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. We introduce a novel
              approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
              functionally important players, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, provides a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, contextualizing them, and revealing
              potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may
              overlook. This approach advances the broader field by offering a
              more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the perspective of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, a critical gap exists in
              understanding how genes, acting in concert, influence complex
              traits across different conditions, a knowledge crucial for
              developing new therapies. This study addresses this gap by
              demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. We introduce a novel
              approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
              functionally important players, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, provides a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, contextualizing them, and revealing
              potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may
              overlook. This approach advances the broader field by offering a
              more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are critical in the onset and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for combined analysis. This representation is
              founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              under identical conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease onset and progression. This highlights a gap in our

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide
              association studies on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet not yet fully
              explored. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
              important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results not only
              answer the question of gene-gene interaction's role in disease
              progression but also advance the field by providing a new tool for
              identifying therapeutic targets and potential drug repurposing
              opportunities.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide
              association studies on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet not fully
              explored. This gap in knowledge hinders our ability to fully
              comprehend disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To address this,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These results underscore the potential of
              PhenoPLIER in elucidating complex trait etiology and identifying
              therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional
              genomics and paving the way for effective drug repurposing.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for
              the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are critical in disease onset and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes impact complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
              development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are critical in the onset and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for a comprehensive analysis. This representation
              is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide
              association studies on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet not fully
              explored. This gap in knowledge hinders our ability to fully
              comprehend disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To address this,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only enhance our
              understanding of disease etiology but also provide a robust
              platform for identifying therapeutic targets and potential drug
              repurposing, thereby advancing the field of genetic studies.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
