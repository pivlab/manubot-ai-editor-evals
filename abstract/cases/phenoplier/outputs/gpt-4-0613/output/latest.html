Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding, as the role of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a unique approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement in genetic studies could significantly enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for more effective therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and progression.

In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their regulation across different conditions, which is where our research comes in. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are critical in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are critical in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide association studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression, a facet not fully explored in existing literature. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene interactions in disease progression but also highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in identifying therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing, thereby pushing the boundaries of genetic studies and functional genomics.

In the field of functional genomics, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across different conditions is crucial for determining their influence on complex traits and for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression, a facet not fully explored in existing literature. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results not only answer the question of gene-gene interaction&#39;s role in disease progression but also highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in identifying therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing, thereby pushing the boundaries of genetic studies and functional genomics.

Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in mechanisms relevant to disease. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
