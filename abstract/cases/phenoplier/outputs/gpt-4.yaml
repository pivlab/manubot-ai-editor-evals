          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important
          genes lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations
          and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these
          interactions and their regulation across different conditions. To
          address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
          important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement could
          significantly enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, propelling the field of functional genomics forward.

          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal.
          However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these
          interactions and their implications for disease and therapy
          development. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic
          associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, advancing the field of functional
          genomics.

          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal.
          However, a gap exists in our ability to map these interactions and
          their implications for disease mechanisms and drug development. To
          address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation. This representation is
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes,
          although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations,
          highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This tool bridges the gap in our understanding of gene
          co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, advancing the
          field of functional genomics.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important
          genes lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations
          and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal.
          However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these
          interactions and their implications for disease and therapy
          development. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting

          offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations,
          highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations,
          thereby advancing the field of functional genomics.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their regulation across different conditions. To address this, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, and advancing our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic
          strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in
          disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked
          to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          we discover that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the perspective of gene modules.

          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these
          interactions and their regulation across different conditions. To
          address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, and
          advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes function
          synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their
          influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
          of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
          modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these
          interactions and their regulation across different conditions. To

          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, and
          advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding
          their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This
          knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
          functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and
          progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these
          interactions and their regulation across different conditions. To
          address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar

          for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, and
          advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, thereby filling the gap in our understanding of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. This approach not only
          contextualizes genetic associations but also uncovers potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby
          advancing the field of functional genomics.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates
          that diseases have significant associations with gene modules
          expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, revealing that functionally significant players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting
          genetic associations, contextualizing them, and uncovering potential
          targets that single-gene strategies may overlook.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial
          for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the
          context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses
          this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We introduce a
          novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results,
          including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that
          functionally important players, often overlooked in single-gene
          strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby
          enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          This approach has broader implications for genetic studies,
          potentially revealing therapeutic targets and aiding in drug
          repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the
          creation of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases have
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we employed a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing
          that functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, provides
          a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations. It
          contextualizes these associations and uncovers potential targets that
          single-gene strategies may overlook.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This study addresses this gap by examining the significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, reveal that functionally important players, often
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic
          targets and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context
          of developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This study addresses this gap by examining the significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, reveal that functionally important players, often
          overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic
          targets and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates
          that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
          collectively influence complex traits across different conditions is
          crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly
          in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study,
          we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. In a specific application, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules but also reveals potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This advancement could significantly contribute to the fields of
          genetic studies, drug repurposing, and the clustering of complex
          traits.

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Our study
          demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, revealing that functionally significant players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
          collectively influence complex traits across different conditions is
          crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly
          in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study,
          we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. In a specific application, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players, although lacking direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules but also reveals potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This approach, therefore, represents a significant advancement in
          genetic studies and drug repurposing, with broad implications for the
          treatment of complex traits.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are vital in the onset and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for a combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and

          examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of the role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, as predicted
          by modern models of complex trait architecture. This paper introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge this gap
          by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that
          functionally important players, although lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
          findings not only answer the question of gene-gene interaction's role
          in disease progression but also highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER
          as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets and advancing drug
          repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries of functional
          genomics.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          influence complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are
          critical in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms
          through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, a gap remains
          in our understanding of how gene-gene interactions influence complex
          traits and disease progression, a critical insight for developing new
          therapies. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally
          important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only
          enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between genes in
          disease etiology but also provides a novel approach for identifying
          potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities,
          thereby advancing the field of functional genomics.

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
          pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are vital in the onset and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for a combined analysis. This
          representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases
          are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
          examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of the role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, as predicted
          by modern models of complex trait architecture. This study introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge this gap
          by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that
          functionally important players, although lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
          findings not only enhance our understanding of disease etiology but
          also provide a robust tool for identifying potential therapeutic
          targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the
          field of functional genomics.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of the role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, as predicted
          by modern models of complex trait architecture. This paper introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge this gap
          by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results reveal
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates that
          functionally important players, although lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
          findings not only enhance our understanding of disease etiology but
          also provide a robust platform for identifying potential therapeutic
          targets and repurposing existing drugs, thereby advancing the broader
          field of functional genomics.

          Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development
          of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in mechanisms
          relevant to disease. However, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in
          the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          we discovered that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The study of gene interactions and their influence on complex traits
          is a critical aspect of understanding disease etiology and developing
          new therapies. Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide
          association studies on the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet that remains
          underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important
          genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the
          potential of PhenoPLIER in elucidating complex trait architecture,
          thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, and paving the way for therapeutic target identification
          and drug repurposing.

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in
              the context of disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to
              effectively map these interactions and their implications for
              disease and therapy development. To address this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
              functionally important players, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to
              interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, advancing the field of functional genomics.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in
              the context of disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to
              map these interactions and their implications for disease
              mechanisms and drug development. To address this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation. This representation is based on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes,
              although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations,
              highlighting potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This tool bridges the gap in our
              understanding of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, advancing the field of functional genomics.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in
              the context of disease origin and progression. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to
              effectively map these interactions and their implications for
              disease and therapy development. To address this, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
              functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting
              genetic associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive
              understanding of genetic associations, thereby advancing the field
              of functional genomics.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
              on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
              However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We note that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              revealed that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the perspective of gene modules.

              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new
              therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes
              in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              vital in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally significant players, although lacking
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
              co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease onset and progression. However, a gap exists in our
              understanding of these interactions and their regulation across
              different conditions. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important
              players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER,
              by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, and advancing our understanding of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease onset and progression. However, a gap exists in our
              understanding of these interactions and their regulation across
              different conditions. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important
              players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER,
              by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, and advancing our understanding of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              vital in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the perspective of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new
              therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes
              in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              vital in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic
              associations, offering insights into potential targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, thereby filling the gap in our understanding of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. This approach not only
              contextualizes genetic associations but also uncovers potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby
              advancing the field of functional genomics.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the creation of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases have significant associations with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employed a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic
              associations. It contextualizes these associations and uncovers
              potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in
              the context of developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in
              our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. This study addresses this gap by examining
              the significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. We introduce a novel approach,
              PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally
              important players, often overlooked by single-gene strategies, are

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge
              is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
              PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              collectively influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in
              our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation,
              particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. In this study, we address this gap by introducing
              PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

              reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This advancement could significantly
              contribute to the fields of genetic studies, drug repurposing, and

              Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge
              is pivotal for the development of novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that interactions between genes are vital in
              the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for a combined analysis. This representation
              is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen
              to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
              understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
              disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide
              association studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding
              of the role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
              progression, as predicted by modern models of complex trait
              architecture. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach designed to bridge this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar

              reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of
              gene-gene interaction's role in disease progression but also
              highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying
              therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing efforts,
              thereby pushing the boundaries of functional genomics.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
              understanding the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms
              through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, a gap
              remains in our understanding of how gene-gene interactions
              influence complex traits and disease progression, a critical
              insight for developing new therapies. To address this, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
              reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              demonstrated that functionally important genes, although lacking
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. This study not only enhances our understanding of
              the complex interplay between genes in disease etiology but also
              provides a novel approach for identifying potential therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the
              field of functional genomics.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge
              is pivotal for the development of novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that interactions between genes are vital in
              the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for a combined analysis. This representation
              is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen
              to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
              understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes impact complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the
              development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are critical in the onset and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for combined analysis. This representation is
              founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              under identical conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
              understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
              disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide
              association studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding
              of the role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
              progression, as predicted by modern models of complex trait
              architecture. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach designed to bridge this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results
              reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              demonstrates that functionally important players, although lacking
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only enhance our understanding
              of disease etiology but also provide a robust platform for
              identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing
              drugs, thereby advancing the broader field of functional genomics.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
