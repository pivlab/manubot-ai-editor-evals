          Here's the revised abstract of the manuscript "Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          making it crucial to understand how they interact to influence complex
          traits. Recent studies have shown that gene-gene interactions play a
          critical role in disease origin and progression. However, deciphering
          these interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of modern
          genomic data. To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association
          studies (TWAS) and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate that incorporating co-expressed
          genes into the analysis contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, enabling the exploration of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms at a systems level.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility and
          treatment response, is increasingly recognized as a multifactorial
          endeavor that requires an understanding of how genes interact with
          each other in specific contexts. However, the current state-of-the-art
          in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has primarily focused
          on individual genes, overlooking the crucial role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and treatment mechanisms. To address
          this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
          mapping these data onto modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic
          understanding of how genetic variations contribute to complex traits.


          Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of this framework for
          identifying novel therapeutic targets. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER fills
          a critical gap in the current state-of-the-art by providing a
          mechanistic understanding of genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, and has broad implications for the interpretation of
          genetic studies and the identification of new therapeutic strategies.

          Here's the revised version of the abstract:


          Genes operate in concert to perform specific functions, and
          understanding how they influence complex traits requires mechanistic
          insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. Recent
          studies have shown that transcriptome-wide association analysis can
          reveal the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. Our approach,
          PhenoPLIER, integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          making it essential to understand how these genes influence complex
          traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. Our computational approach,
          PhenoPLIER, maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
          identify diseases associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. We find that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a comprehensive
          understanding of the interplay between genetics and gene expression in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression
          Patterns Highlights Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms


          Keywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression,
          therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits


          Abstract:


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          making it crucial to understand expression regulation across different
          conditions to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex traits.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes involved in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions are essential for disease origin and
          progression. Our computational approach, PhenoPLIER, integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation, enabling a joint analysis of these data
          types. This representation is built on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          find that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting
          the potential of this framework for identifying novel therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets for drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Despite advances in
          transcriptome-wide association studies, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex traits. Here, we

          gene modules and predict known drug-disease pairs with inferred
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, our approach prioritizes functionally
          important players lacking associations but present in trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Here's the revised abstract of your manuscript, with improvements in
          clarity, concision, and consistency:


          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent space for joint analysis. By grouping co-expressed genes
          into modules, we provide a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, crucial for developing new
          therapies. Our approach predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          identifies trait-associated modules that prioritize functionally
          important players, even in the absence of direct associations. Using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate the power of
          PhenoPLIER in revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. By contextualizing genetic associations within
          gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic studies and uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Currently,
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. Our novel
          computational approach, PhenoPLIER, addresses this gap by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and its broader
          significance lies in its ability to reveal potential therapeutic
          targets and mechanisms of action that would have been missed by
          traditional single-gene studies.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to
          identify latent modules of co-regulated genes. By mapping these
          modules to cell-type specific expression patterns, we provide a
          mechanistic understanding of how genetic variations contribute to
          complex traits. Our approach prioritizes functionally important
          players in trait-associated modules, revealing potential therapeutic
          targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies. We validate
          PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action using a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. Our findings demonstrate the power of incorporating
          co-expression information to contextualize genetic associations and
          identify novel therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER provides a framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
          modules, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbations by integrating
          transcriptome-wide association studies and functional genomics. By
          clustering genes based on co-expression patterns across diverse
          conditions, PhenoPLIER uncovers the complex interplay between genes in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and identifies trait-associated modules that
          prioritize functionally important players, even in the absence of
          direct associations. By incorporating gene co-expression into the
          analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive framework for
          understanding the mechanisms underlying complex traits and identifying
          novel therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate the power of this
          approach by revealing insights into lipid regulation and its impact on
          disease progression.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet current
          approaches neglect the interplay between genes within specific
          contexts. PhenoPLIER fills this gap by mapping gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis. Our novel approach identifies
          modules of co-expressed genes that underlie complex traits, revealing

          In the field of functional genomics, identifying the genetic basis of
          complex traits and understanding how they respond to therapeutic
          interventions remains a significant challenge. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          progression. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that projects genetic associations onto a
          common latent representation, allowing for a joint analysis of
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.


          Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, which are found to be
          significantly associated with diseases and accurately predict known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results demonstrate the
          power of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets and
          providing insights into disease mechanisms, ultimately leading to the
          development of new therapies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing a
          comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between genes and

          Sure! Here's the revised abstract based on your keywords:


          Advances in functional genomics have revealed that genes act in
          concert to perform specific functions, making it essential to
          understand how these genes influence complex traits. By analyzing gene
          expression patterns across different conditions, our study uncovers
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the lens of gene modules.
          We show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our novel framework,
          PhenoPLIER, incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. By projecting genetic associations through
          gene expression patterns, we provide a comprehensive understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for innovative
          therapeutic approaches through drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions, as genes act in
          concert with each other to perform their functions. Despite the
          importance of this insight for developing new therapies, current
          approaches have limitations in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Our research fills this gap by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, using PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed

          The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility, requires
          a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Currently, there is a gap in our knowledge of how genes
          interact to produce these traits, and existing approaches have
          limitations in predicting drug-disease pairs and identifying
          mechanisms of action. Our research fills this gap by using a novel
          approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. By analyzing lipid
          regulation using CRISPR screens, we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which has broader significance for understanding disease etiology and
          developing new therapeutic targets.

          Here's a revised version of the abstract:


          Genetic studies have long recognized that genes work together to
          perform specific functions, but determining how these genes contribute
          to complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. In this study, we demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules provides a powerful tool for understanding disease
          etiology and identifying new therapeutic targets.

          Here, we address a critical gap in understanding how genes collaborate
          to produce complex traits and diseases, and how this knowledge can
          inform drug development. Currently, research has primarily focused on
          single genes or gene sets, neglecting the interconnected nature of
          gene expression regulation. Our study demonstrates that groupings of
          co-expressed genes (gene modules) are essential for understanding
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By using a novel approach called
          PhenoPLIER, we identify trait-associated gene modules that are
          enriched with functionally important players missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with specific gene expression patterns in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and inferred mechanisms of action. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides
          a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          revealing potential therapeutic targets that were previously
          overlooked. This study's findings have significant implications for
          the development of new treatments for complex diseases, highlighting
          the importance of considering gene expression patterns in the search
          for effective therapies.

          Genes function in concert to perform specific biological tasks, making
          it crucial to understand how they contribute to complex traits. Our
          study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, providing a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This insight is critical for developing new therapies. We demonstrate
          the accuracy of our approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs
          and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation. Our novel framework, PhenoPLIER, incorporates groups of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns, we highlight
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a comprehensive
          understanding of complex traits.

          The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions, as genes act in
          concert to perform their functions. However, current approaches have
          limitations in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Our research fills this gap by using a novel
          approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important
          players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the broader
          significance of incorporating gene expression patterns into genetic
          studies, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and
          mechanisms of action for complex diseases.

          The study of complex traits and diseases has long been hindered by the
          difficulty in understanding how genes interact with each other to
          produce specific outcomes. While recent advances in functional
          genomics have provided valuable insights into gene expression
          patterns, there remains a need for a mechanistic understanding of how
          these patterns relate to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our
          research fills this gap by utilizing a novel approach called
          PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. By analyzing gene expression patterns
          across different conditions, we find that diseases are significantly
          associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players
          lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of this approach for
          identifying novel therapeutic targets. In conclusion, our study
          demonstrates the power of incorporating gene co-expression into
          genetic association studies, providing a framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and advancing
          our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players

          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have long recognized the importance of understanding
          how genes interact in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Recent advances in functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis
          have revealed that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. However, uncovering these interactions
          and their mechanisms has remained a challenge. Our novel computational
          approach, PhenoPLIER, addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
          built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          relevant conditions, allowing us to identify diseases that are
          significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in the
          same cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action, and we have used a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and prioritize functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules. By leveraging these
          insights, our study highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER for
          identifying new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities
          for complex diseases.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          making it essential to understand how these genes influence complex
          traits. Recent studies have shown that transcriptome-wide association
          analyses can uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. To address this challenge, we
          developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions.


          We applied PhenoPLIER to analyze diseases and drug-disease pairs, and
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach was accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER in
          identifying disease-relevant genetic variations and elucidating their
          underlying mechanisms, ultimately facilitating the development of new
          therapeutic strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          gene expression regulation across different conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have identified the role of
          individual genes, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
          gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action, and we find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our study fills the gap in understanding the mechanisms of
          complex traits and provides a powerful tool for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          Here's the revised version of the abstract:


          Determining how genes interact to influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Recent studies have shown that gene-gene interactions play
          a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet identifying
          these interactions remains a challenge. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with
          diseases and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs. Moreover,
          our approach identifies functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules, providing
          valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic
          targets. By integrating genetic studies, functional genomics, and gene
          co-expression analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for
          uncovering the etiology of complex diseases and identifying new drug
          targets.

          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

          data and pharmacological perturbations, our study highlights the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provides a powerful tool for
          identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing
          drugs.

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          making it essential to understand how these genes influence complex
          traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and
          progression. Our computational approach, PhenoPLIER, maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our study highlights the power of integrating genetic
          studies with functional genomics to project genetic associations and
          uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights
          into the role of individual genes in complex traits, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, we
          observe significant associations between diseases and these modules,
          particularly in cell types relevant to the disease. Our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the broader significance of our
          approach for identifying new therapeutic targets and elucidating
          disease mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have long recognized the importance of understanding
          how genes work together to influence complex traits.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes involved in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in trait origin and
          progression. To better understand these interactions, we developed
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions,
          allowing us to identify disease-associated modules and predict known
          drug-disease pairs with high accuracy. Moreover, we find that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER, even if they lack direct associations with
          diseases. These insights have the potential to reveal new therapeutic
          targets and drug mechanisms for treating complex diseases.

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is

          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility and
          therapeutic responses, requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across different conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes involved in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which are
          found to be significantly associated with diseases and accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, our approach prioritizes functionally important
          players lacking associations but present in trait-associated modules,
          as revealed by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By filling
          this knowledge gap, our study contributes to the development of new
          therapies and a deeper understanding of disease etiology.

              Here's the revised abstract of the manuscript "Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms":


              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, making it crucial to understand how they interact to
              influence complex traits. Recent studies have shown that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression. However, deciphering these interactions remains
              challenging due to the complexity of modern genomic data. To
              address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies
              (TWAS) and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important
              players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
              co-expressed genes into the analysis contextualizes genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling
              the exploration of disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a
              systems level.

              abstract of this manuscript.


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in
              specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how
              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility and
              treatment response, is increasingly recognized as a multifactorial
              endeavor that requires an understanding of how genes interact with
              each other in specific contexts. However, the current
              state-of-the-art in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
              has primarily focused on individual genes, overlooking the crucial
              role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and treatment
              mechanisms. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By mapping these data onto
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              conditions, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of how
              genetic variations contribute to complex traits.


              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential
              of this framework for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER fills a critical gap in the current
              state-of-the-art by providing a mechanistic understanding of
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and has
              broad implications for the interpretation of genetic studies and
              the identification of new therapeutic strategies.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Here's the revised version of the abstract:


              Genes operate in concert to perform specific functions, and
              understanding how they influence complex traits requires
              mechanistic insight into expression regulation across diverse
              conditions. Recent studies have shown that transcriptome-wide
              association analysis can reveal the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screens
              to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important
              players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions, allowing us to identify diseases associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We find that
              PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a comprehensive
              understanding of the interplay between genetics and gene
              expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, an approach that
              has been missing in the current literature. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are

              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              Abstract:


              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, making it crucial to understand expression regulation
              across different conditions to uncover the mechanisms underlying
              complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, but
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are essential
              for disease origin and progression. Our computational approach,
              PhenoPLIER, integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling a
              joint analysis of these data types. This representation is built
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions, allowing us to observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, we find
              that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER,
              highlighting the potential of this framework for identifying novel
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

              The study of complex traits is hindered by the lack of
              understanding of how genes interact in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Recent transcriptome-wide association
              studies have identified individual genes contributing to disease
              mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address
              this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By mapping groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the power of our
              approach using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where
              we find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, with broader
              implications for developing new therapies.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to

              Here's a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation
              across different conditions. Recent studies have shown that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, yet identifying these interactions remains a
              challenge. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is built on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, and we find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action, and using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
              provides a promising avenue for understanding disease etiology and
              developing new therapeutic targets.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Despite advances
              in transcriptome-wide association studies, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex traits.
              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By mapping modules of co-expressed genes across
              conditions, we identify disease-associated gene modules and
              predict known drug-disease pairs with inferred mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, our approach prioritizes functionally important
              players lacking associations but present in trait-associated
              modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies and offering insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent space for joint analysis. By grouping co-expressed

              expression regulation across diverse conditions, crucial for
              developing new therapies. Our approach predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and identifies trait-associated modules that prioritize
              functionally important players, even in the absence of direct
              associations. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER in revealing potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
              contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations into a
              common latent space for joint analysis. By grouping co-expressed
              genes into modules, we reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of
              complex traits and disease etiology. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies novel therapeutic
              targets by prioritizing functionally important players within
              trait-associated gene modules. We demonstrate the power of
              PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              where we find that functionally important genes lacking clear
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
              study highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression
              patterns when interpreting genetic associations and uncovering
              potential drug mechanisms. By providing a novel framework for
              contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for identifying new
              therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Currently,
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
              modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Our novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER,
              addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our approach provides a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules, and its broader significance lies in its
              ability to reveal potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of
              action that would have been missed by traditional single-gene
              studies.

              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates

              and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, by providing a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER
              offers a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. Our approach can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations by
              integrating transcriptome-wide association studies and functional
              genomics. By clustering genes based on co-expression patterns
              across diverse conditions, PhenoPLIER uncovers the complex
              interplay between genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              identifies trait-associated modules that prioritize functionally
              important players, even in the absence of direct associations. By
              incorporating gene co-expression into the analysis, PhenoPLIER
              provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the
              mechanisms underlying complex traits and identifying novel
              therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate the power of this
              approach by revealing insights into lipid regulation and its
              impact on disease progression.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet current
              approaches neglect the interplay between genes within specific

              latent representation for a joint analysis. Our novel approach
              identifies modules of co-expressed genes that underlie complex

              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, identifying the genetic basis
              of complex traits and understanding how they respond to
              therapeutic interventions remains a significant challenge. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              etiology and progression. To address this gap, we developed
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that projects genetic
              associations onto a common latent representation, allowing for a
              joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, which are found to be
              significantly associated with diseases and accurately predict
              known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              results demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER in identifying
              potential therapeutic targets and providing insights into disease
              mechanisms, ultimately leading to the development of new
              therapies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex
              interplay between genes and their role in disease etiology and
              treatment. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the
              field of functional genomics and personalized medicine, enabling
              researchers to better understand the mechanisms underlying complex
              traits and identify new therapeutic targets for a wide range of
              diseases.

              Advances in functional genomics have revealed that genes act in
              concert to perform specific functions, making it essential to
              understand how these genes influence complex traits. By analyzing
              gene expression patterns across different conditions, our study
              uncovers disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the lens of
              gene modules. We show that diseases are significantly associated
              with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation. Our novel framework, PhenoPLIER,
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. By projecting genetic associations through gene

              innovative therapeutic approaches through drug repurposing and

              concert, and understanding their expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. Our
              study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our results show that incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER
              offers a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility,
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. Currently, there is a gap in our
              knowledge of how genes interact to produce these traits, and
              existing approaches have limitations in predicting drug-disease
              pairs and identifying mechanisms of action. Our research fills
              this gap by using a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. By analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate
              the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance
              for understanding disease etiology and developing new therapeutic
              targets.

              Genetic studies have long recognized that genes work together to
              perform specific functions, but determining how these genes
              contribute to complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across different conditions. In this

              Here, we address a critical gap in understanding how genes
              collaborate to produce complex traits and diseases, and how this
              knowledge can inform drug development. Currently, research has
              primarily focused on single genes or gene sets, neglecting the
              interconnected nature of gene expression regulation. Our study
              demonstrates that groupings of co-expressed genes (gene modules)
              are essential for understanding disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. By using a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, we
              identify trait-associated gene modules that are enriched with
              functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              specific gene expression patterns in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred
              mechanisms of action. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a
              powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations and
              revealing potential therapeutic targets that were previously
              overlooked. This study's findings have significant implications
              for the development of new treatments for complex diseases,
              highlighting the importance of considering gene expression
              patterns in the search for effective therapies.

              Here's the revised abstract of the manuscript 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms':


              Genes function in concert to perform specific biological tasks,
              making it crucial to understand how they contribute to complex
              traits. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              providing a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
              approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation. Our novel framework, PhenoPLIER, incorporates groups
              of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and

              The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across different conditions, as genes act
              in concert to perform their functions. However, current approaches
              have limitations in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Our research fills this gap by
              using a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates
              groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the broader significance of
              incorporating gene expression patterns into genetic studies,
              enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and
              mechanisms of action for complex diseases.

              The study of complex traits and diseases has long been hindered by
              the difficulty in understanding how genes interact with each other
              to produce specific outcomes. While recent advances in functional
              genomics have provided valuable insights into gene expression
              patterns, there remains a need for a mechanistic understanding of
              how these patterns relate to disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              Our research fills this gap by utilizing a novel approach called
              PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. By analyzing gene expression
              patterns across different conditions, we find that diseases are
              significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER,
              highlighting the potential of this approach for identifying novel
              therapeutic targets. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the
              power of incorporating gene co-expression into genetic association
              studies, providing a framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules and advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genetic studies have long recognized the importance of
              understanding how genes interact in specific contexts to perform
              their functions. Recent advances in functional genomics and gene
              co-expression analysis have revealed that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However,
              uncovering these interactions and their mechanisms has remained a
              challenge. Our novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, addresses
              this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, allowing
              us to identify diseases that are significantly associated with
              specific gene modules expressed in the same cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action, and we have used a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation and prioritize functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules. By leveraging these insights, our study
              highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER for identifying new
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for complex
              diseases.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, allowing us to identify disease-associated
              modules and prioritize functionally important players lacking
              direct associations. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important players lacking direct associations in
              trait-associated modules. Our approach fills a critical gap in the
              current literature by providing a mechanistic understanding of
              gene-gene interactions in complex traits and highlights potential
              therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms


              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, making it essential to understand how these genes
              influence complex traits. Recent studies have shown that
              transcriptome-wide association analyses can uncover the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions.


              We applied PhenoPLIER to analyze diseases and drug-disease pairs,
              and found that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach
              was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings demonstrate
              the power of PhenoPLIER in identifying disease-relevant genetic
              variations and elucidating their underlying mechanisms, ultimately
              facilitating the development of new therapeutic strategies.

              Determining how genes interact to influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. Recent studies have shown that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, yet identifying these interactions remains a
              challenge. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, maps gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with
              diseases and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs.
              Moreover, our approach identifies functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules,
              providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential
              therapeutic targets. By integrating genetic studies, functional
              genomics, and gene co-expression analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a
              powerful tool for uncovering the etiology of complex diseases and
              identifying new drug targets.

              The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred
              mechanisms of action, and we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating gene expression data and
              pharmacological perturbations, our study highlights the importance
              of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, and provides a powerful tool for
              identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing
              drugs.

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns

              Genetic studies have long recognized the importance of
              understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
              genes involved in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in trait origin
              and progression. To better understand these interactions, we
              developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is built on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to identify
              disease-associated modules and predict known drug-disease pairs
              with high accuracy. Moreover, we find that functionally important
              players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER,
              even if they lack direct associations with diseases. These
              insights have the potential to reveal new therapeutic targets and
              drug mechanisms for treating complex diseases.

              The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility and
              therapeutic responses, requires a mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation across different conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
              genes involved in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, which are found to be significantly
              associated with diseases and accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              our approach prioritizes functionally important players lacking
              associations but present in trait-associated modules, as revealed
              by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By filling this
              knowledge gap, our study contributes to the development of new
              therapies and a deeper understanding of disease etiology.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").
