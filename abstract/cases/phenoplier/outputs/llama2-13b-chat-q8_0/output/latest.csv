Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across different conditions. Recent studies have shown that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, identifying the relevant interactions among thousands of genes remains a challenge. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, addresses this challenge by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the power of incorporating co-expressed genes into the analysis of genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Abstract:

Genes operate in concerted harmony to perform specific functions, making it crucial to understand how they interact across diverse conditions to uncover their role in complex traits. Traditional approaches have relied on identifying individual gene associations with diseases, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease origin and progression. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions to provide a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential for uncovering novel therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, offering valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By incorporating co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets for therapeutic intervention, offering a powerful tool for personalized medicine and precision health.","[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

Genetic studies have long emphasized the importance of understanding how genes interact with one another to influence complex traits. However, traditional approaches have focused on individual genes rather than the coordinated activity of gene groups, or modules. Our novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, integrates transcriptome-wide association studies and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation that captures the underlying architecture of complex traits. By mapping gene-trait associations and drug-disease pairs onto this shared framework, we reveal novel insights into disease etiology and therapeutic targets. Our approach prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even if they lack direct genetic associations. We demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens and highlight its potential for identifying new therapeutic strategies missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

Title: Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms

Keywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.

Abstract:

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex diseases. By mapping these data into a common latent representation, we identify clusters of co-expressed genes that play critical roles in disease etiology and drug response. Our approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating functional genomics data from CRISPR screens, we prioritize functionally important players lacking clear genetic associations but embedded within trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.","[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns has long been recognized as a critical step towards understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, the complex interplay between genes in different contexts has hindered progress in this area. Our study addresses this challenge by leveraging co-expression networks to identify disease-associated gene modules and predict drug-disease pairs with high accuracy. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important players are often overlooked in single-gene approaches but prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight the power of incorporating co-expression information into genetic association studies, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action.

Here is the revised abstract of your manuscript, with a clear sentence structure and following the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:

Context: Genetic studies have shown that complex traits are influenced by multiple genes acting together in specific contexts. However, understanding how these genes interact to cause disease and identifying potential therapeutic targets has been challenging due to the complexity of gene expression regulation. Recent advances in functional genomics and transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origin and progression.

Content: To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We applied PhenoPLIER to a dataset of human diseases and drug-disease pairs, and found that our approach accurately predicts known associations and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of integrating gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to understand disease etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER provides a powerful approach for projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which can help prioritize functionally important players in complex traits and inform drug repurposing efforts.

The context: Understanding how genes collaborate to produce complex traits is crucial for developing novel therapeutics, yet the interplay between gene-gene interactions and expression regulation remains poorly understood. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease origin and progression. The gap in the literature is a lack of mechanistic understanding of how these interactions contribute to complex traits.

The content: Our novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with trait-associated modules and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genetic studies have long emphasized the importance of understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits. Recent advances in functional genomics have revealed that gene co-expression patterns are a key aspect of this interaction, yet modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To better understand these mechanisms, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, and we find that diseases are significantly associated with these modules expressed in specific cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Interestingly, we also identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.","[FAIL] (0.75) Expected output to contain ""CRISPR""
