The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility and treatment response, is increasingly recognized as a multifactorial endeavor that requires an understanding of how genes interact with each other in specific contexts. However, the current state-of-the-art in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) has primarily focused on individual genes, overlooking the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and treatment mechanisms. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By mapping these data onto modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of how genetic variations contribute to complex traits.

Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of this framework for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER fills a critical gap in the current state-of-the-art by providing a mechanistic understanding of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and has broad implications for the interpretation of genetic studies and the identification of new therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:

Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, making it crucial to understand expression regulation across different conditions to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease origin and progression. Our computational approach, PhenoPLIER, integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling a joint analysis of these data types. This representation is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of this framework for identifying novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations by integrating transcriptome-wide association studies and functional genomics. By clustering genes based on co-expression patterns across diverse conditions, PhenoPLIER uncovers the complex interplay between genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies trait-associated modules that prioritize functionally important players, even in the absence of direct associations. By incorporating gene co-expression into the analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex traits and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate the power of this approach by revealing insights into lipid regulation and its impact on disease progression.

In the field of functional genomics, identifying the genetic basis of complex traits and understanding how they respond to therapeutic interventions remains a significant challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that projects genetic associations onto a common latent representation, allowing for a joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which are found to be significantly associated with diseases and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets and providing insights into disease mechanisms, ultimately leading to the development of new therapies.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between genes and their role in disease etiology and treatment. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine, enabling researchers to better understand the mechanisms underlying complex traits and identify new therapeutic targets for a wide range of diseases.

Currently, research has primarily focused on single genes or gene sets, neglecting the interconnected nature of gene expression regulation. Our study demonstrates that groupings of co-expressed genes (gene modules) are essential for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By using a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, we identify trait-associated gene modules that are enriched with functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene expression patterns in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets that were previously overlooked. This study's findings have significant implications for the development of new treatments for complex diseases, highlighting the importance of considering gene expression patterns in the search for effective therapies.

Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms

Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, making it essential to understand how these genes influence complex traits. Recent studies have shown that transcriptome-wide association analyses can uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

We applied PhenoPLIER to analyze diseases and drug-disease pairs, and found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER in identifying disease-relevant genetic variations and elucidating their underlying mechanisms, ultimately facilitating the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Determining how genes interact to influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Recent studies have shown that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, yet identifying these interactions remains a challenge. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with diseases and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, our approach identifies functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules, providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. By integrating genetic studies, functional genomics, and gene co-expression analysis, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for uncovering the etiology of complex diseases and identifying new drug targets.

The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action, and we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations, our study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provides a powerful tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.

Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms

Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, making it essential to understand how these genes influence complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. Our computational approach, PhenoPLIER, maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study highlights the power of integrating genetic studies with functional genomics to project genetic associations and uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

To address this knowledge gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genetic studies have long recognized the importance of understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in trait origin and progression. To better understand these interactions, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to identify disease-associated modules and predict known drug-disease pairs with high accuracy. Moreover, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even if they lack direct associations with diseases. These insights have the potential to reveal new therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms for treating complex diseases.

The study of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility and therapeutic responses, requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which are found to be significantly associated with diseases and accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, our approach prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations but present in trait-associated modules, as revealed by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By filling this knowledge gap, our study contributes to the development of new therapies and a deeper understanding of disease etiology.
