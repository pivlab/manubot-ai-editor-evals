 In the pursuit of understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a gap exists in adequately capturing gene-gene interactions and functional groups within complex traits. This context highlights the need for innovative approaches to decipher gene expression patterns across conditions. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that bridges gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data through a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating modules of genes with coordinated expression patterns in specific contexts, our approach addresses the shortcoming of relying solely on individual genes to unravel disease processes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge about gene roles in diseases, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origins and progression.

PhenoPLIER's representation allows for the successful identification of disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers mechanisms of action. In a case study using CRISPR to analyze lipid regulation, we observed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes without direct genetic association, demonstrating its ability to fill critical gaps in single-gene approaches.

In conclusion, by integrating co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable perspective on interpreting genetic associations within the context of functional groups, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach offers a novel framework for linking genetics with expression patterns to inform therapeutic target identification and potentially drive drug repurposing initiatives.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

In complex biological systems, gene interactions play a pivotal role in performing their specific functions. Elucidating these gene influences on intricate traits necessitates an in-depth understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge has been demonstrated to be crucial in devising novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules predominantly expressed in relevant cell types. Consequently, our approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease correlations and unraveling the mechanisms underlying these actions. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, we identified functionally vital genes that lack direct genetic associations but are highlighted within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic findings and exposes potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Genes collaboratively execute their functions within specific contexts, underscoring the necessity of understanding gene interactions to elucidate complex trait influences. The significance of this regulatory insight in advancing novel therapies has been established. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated identifying individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation depends on groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, analyzing lipid regulation via a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally critical genes without explicit associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>

In the field of complex trait genetics, genes collaboratively execute their functions within specific contexts. To fully understand gene influences on these traits, it is crucial to grasp expression regulation across varying conditions. This understanding has been shown to be vital for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms but overlook the potential contribution of gene-gene interactions. Recent advances in complex trait architecture models suggest that these interactions play a significant part in disease genesis and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals action mechanisms. In a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we found that functionally important genes without direct associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules, emphasizing its capability to uncover overlooked genetic contributors in complex traits.</td>

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
