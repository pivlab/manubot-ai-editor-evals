          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon modules of genes that exhibit coherent
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Our method shows proficiency in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
          lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet
          playing functional roles are identified within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression
          modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal for
          advancing therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease
          mechanisms, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology remains underexplored. This gap hinders the identification of
          novel therapeutic targets and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages
          gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a
          unified latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological data. Our method identifies modules
          of co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules pertinent to relevant
          cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships but also elucidates potential mechanisms of action. For
          instance, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted
          that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
          direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in our understanding of gene
          networks in disease by contextualizing genetic associations within
          co-expression frameworks, thereby uncovering therapeutic targets that
          single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach holds promise for
          enhancing drug discovery and repurposing by illuminating the complex
          clustering of traits at the molecular level.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is
          pivotal for advancing disease etiology and identifying therapeutic
          targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the roles of individual genes, the intricate web of gene-gene
          interactions and their impact on disease manifestation remains less
          explored. This gap hinders the development of new therapies that could
          benefit from a more comprehensive view of gene function. Addressing
          this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic studies and
          pharmacological data, offering a unified analysis of gene-trait
          associations. PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space representation
          based on co-expression modules, enabling the identification of disease
          associations with gene clusters active in relevant cell types. Our
          findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and elucidates drug mechanisms of action.
          Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
          can prioritize functionally significant genes that traditional
          single-gene analyses often overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          enhances our ability to interpret genetic associations by considering
          the collective behavior of gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach
          represents a significant stride in clustering complex traits, with
          broad implications for functional genomics and the development of
          precision medicine.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in
          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a
          CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes
          lacking direct associations yet functionally significant are
          identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context
          to genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework
          offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations
          through the prism of gene expression modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal for
          advancing therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease
          mechanisms, the significance of gene-gene interactions in the etiology
          of diseases remains underexplored. This gap hinders the identification
          of novel therapeutic targets and the repurposing of existing drugs.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations
          onto a unified latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Our method clusters
          genes into modules based on co-expression across various conditions,
          enabling the identification of disease-associated modules and the
          prediction of drug-disease relationships. Our results demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER accurately identifies known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally significant genes that lack direct associations,
          underscoring the utility of our module-based approach. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional
          genomics, offering a powerful tool for contextualizing genetic
          associations within gene modules and uncovering elusive therapeutic
          targets. This framework not only enhances our understanding of disease
          etiology but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the
          clustering of complex traits.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under
          consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease
          relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we identify key functional genes that, despite lacking
          direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a comprehensive
          perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of
          gene expression modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is
          pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic
          targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the roles of individual genes, the significance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease development remains underexplored. This gap
          hinders the advancement of novel treatments and drug repurposing
          strategies. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations onto a unified latent space, facilitating the
          simultaneous analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbations. Our method employs co-expression modules to capture the
          concerted action of genes across various conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by contextualizing
          genetic associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This
          approach holds promise for enhancing drug discovery and repurposing by
          providing a more comprehensive view of gene function and interaction
          in complex traits.

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is
          pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic
          targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the roles of individual genes, the significance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease development remains underexplored. Addressing
          this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic
          associations with disease mechanisms and drug responses. PhenoPLIER
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a
          unified latent space, based on co-expression modules, facilitating a
          comprehensive analysis. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations,
          underscoring the utility of our method in identifying potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic associations within gene
          modules but also advances our understanding of complex trait
          clustering and drug repurposing, offering a robust framework for
          functional genomics research and the development of precision
          medicine.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing new therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes
          exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
          with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. The accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER is evident in its ability to predict established
          drug-disease relationships and deduce mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes key functional genes that, despite lacking
          direct associations, are embedded within trait-associated gene
          modules.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a novel perspective
          for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
          modules, paving the way for improved understanding of disease etiology
          and the identification of novel drug mechanisms.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of
          individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in
          capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that underpin complex
          trait architectures. This gap hinders the development of new therapies
          and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data within a unified
          latent space for comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages gene
          co-expression modules, which reflect concerted gene activity across
          various conditions, to illuminate the genetic underpinnings of
          diseases and their connection to cellular contexts. Our findings
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Notably, it
          also identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct

          by a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER transcends the limitations of single-gene approaches by
          providing a framework that situates genetic associations within the
          context of gene modules, thereby uncovering novel disease etiologies
          and potential therapeutic targets. This advancement propels the field
          of functional genomics forward by offering a more nuanced
          understanding of gene expression patterns in relation to complex
          diseases and drug mechanisms.

          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes operate
          synergistically within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under
          varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of these
          genes on complex traits, a process pivotal to the development of novel
          therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of
          complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the
          foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent expression patterns
          under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately predicting established
          drug-disease relationships and deducing mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack
          direct associations within trait-associated modules. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context
          to genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel
          framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic
          associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of
          individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in
          capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that underpin the
          architecture of complex traits and their progression. This gap hinders
          the development of new therapies and the repurposing of existing
          drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that leverages gene co-expression patterns to construct a latent
          representation, enabling the joint analysis of gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbations. Our method reveals significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
          trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen focused
          on lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in our
          understanding of genetic associations by integrating co-expressed gene
          clusters, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene strategies may overlook. This framework offers a new
          perspective for interpreting genetic data, with broad implications for
          drug discovery and the clustering of complex traits.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of
          individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in
          capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that underpin the
          architecture of complex traits. This gap hinders the development of
          new therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this
          gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data
          into a unified latent representation, enabling a comprehensive
          analysis of gene co-expression networks. PhenoPLIER leverages modules
          of co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations with
          diseases in relevant cell types and accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Our findings
          include the identification of key regulatory genes in lipid metabolism
          through a CRISPR screen, which, despite lacking direct associations,
          are highlighted within trait-associated modules. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only enhances our mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation in disease but also uncovers potential
          therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches.
          This framework represents a significant step forward in the
          interpretation of genetic associations, offering new avenues for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait correlations with pharmacological perturbation
          data within a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific biological contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene
          expression across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating
          complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the
          etiology and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
          modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
          under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are
          significantly linked to gene modules active in pertinent cell types.
          The accuracy of PhenoPLIER is demonstrated by its successful
          prediction of established drug-disease relationships and its ability
          to deduce mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation identified key functional genes that,
          despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends traditional single-gene approaches
          by integrating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a
          more comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
          novel framework offers a transformative perspective for interpreting
          genetic associations through the prism of gene modules, enhancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and
          repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases.


          PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes
          exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions.
          Our analysis reveals that disease states are significantly correlated
          with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The method
          demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing drug action mechanisms. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that
          PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for
          genes that lack direct associations yet are functionally significant.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
          genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a novel perspective
          for interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene modules,
          providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug
          repurposing efforts.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of
          individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in
          capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that underpin complex
          trait architectures and disease progression. Addressing this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages
          gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and
          pharmacological data into a unified latent space, facilitating a
          comprehensive analysis of gene networks. PhenoPLIER constructs modules
          of co-expressed genes under similar conditions, enabling the
          identification of disease associations with gene clusters expressed in
          relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the method's precision in
          predicting known drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          revealed that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally
          significant genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the
          utility of our gene module-based approach. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          transcends the limitations of single-gene analyses by contextualizing
          genetic associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This framework
          represents a significant stride in the pursuit of drug repurposing and
          the clustering of complex traits, offering a new vantage point for
          functional genomics research.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we
          discovered that genes of functional significance, despite lacking
          direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules
          by our tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework offers a
          new perspective for interpreting genetic associations via gene
          expression patterns, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology
          and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for uncovering
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. However, current
          genetic studies often overlook the collective influence of
          co-expressed gene clusters, potentially missing key insights into
          disease mechanisms and drug efficacy. Addressing this gap, our
          research leverages a novel analytical framework, PhenoPLIER, to
          elucidate the relationship between gene modules and complex traits
          within relevant cellular contexts. Here we demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent

          PhenoPLIER transcends the limitations of single-gene strategies by
          integrating co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby illuminating potential therapeutic targets and
          facilitating drug repurposing. This approach advances our
          understanding of genetic underpinnings in disease and opens new
          avenues for targeted treatment strategies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          execute their functions. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
          elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
          cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our
          study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
          correlated with gene modules that are expressed in pertinent cell
          types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening
          focused on lipid regulation, we discovered that certain functionally
          critical genes, although not directly associated with traits, are
          nevertheless highlighted within trait-associated modules by our
          analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters
          of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations,
          thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
          overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative
          framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic
          associations via gene expression patterns, enhancing our understanding
          of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing
          efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for unveiling
          disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. However,
          current genetic studies often overlook the collective influence of
          co-expressed gene clusters, thereby missing key insights into disease
          mechanisms and potential drug interventions. Addressing this gap, our
          research leverages a novel analytical framework, PhenoPLIER, to
          elucidate the relationship between gene modules and complex traits
          within relevant cellular contexts. Here we demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and deciphers their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employ a
          CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing that
          PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally important genes that
          lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules.
          In conclusion, our findings indicate that PhenoPLIER successfully
          contextualizes genetic associations by focusing on gene expression
          patterns, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          single-gene approaches may overlook. This advancement in functional
          genomics not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology but
          also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of
          clustering of complex traits.

          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the

          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we
          discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. This
          underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis

          interpreting genetic associations by integrating the concept of gene
          co-expression modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for unveiling
          disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. However,
          current approaches often overlook the collective influence of
          co-expressed gene clusters, thereby missing key insights into disease
          mechanisms and potential drug interventions. Addressing this gap, our
          study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that
          leverages gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic
          underpinnings of diseases and inform drug repurposing strategies.
          Here, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately associates diseases
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, successfully
          predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action.
          Notably, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack
          direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating
          gene modules, thereby enhancing our ability to contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover therapeutic targets that may otherwise be
          overlooked. This advancement holds promise for refining our
          understanding of disease etiology and accelerating the discovery of
          drug mechanisms and repurposing opportunities.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          execute their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules that are expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
          methodology exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid
          regulation, we discovered that certain genes of functional importance,
          despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In
          summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
          provide context to genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
          approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for
          interpreting genetic associations via gene expression patterns,
          enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
          repurposing strategies.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the orchestration
          of gene expression is pivotal for elucidating the molecular
          underpinnings of complex traits and diseases, yet current approaches
          often overlook the collective influence of gene networks. This gap
          hinders the identification of therapeutic targets and the repurposing
          of existing drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns to
          enhance the interpretation of genetic associations with diseases. Our
          study demonstrates that disease etiology is closely linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          significant genes that traditional single-gene association studies
          might miss. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic
          studies and functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for
          identifying disease etiology and informing drug discovery. By focusing
          on gene modules rather than individual genes, PhenoPLIER sets the
          stage for more effective therapeutic targeting and drug repurposing,
          thereby advancing the clustering of complex traits and the quest for
          precision medicine.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across diverse conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screen investigating lipid
          metabolism, we discovered that certain functionally critical genes,
          although not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression modules to
          provide insights into disease etiology and inform drug repurposing
          strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for uncovering
          disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. However,
          current genetic studies often overlook the collective influence of
          co-expressed gene clusters, potentially missing key insights into
          disease mechanisms and drug actions. This study bridges this gap by
          leveraging gene expression patterns to enhance the projection of
          genetic associations onto disease processes and drug mechanisms. Here,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that
          integrates co-expression networks with genetic data to elucidate the
          role of gene modules in disease manifestation and treatment efficacy.
          Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and uncovers the mechanisms of action for
          various drugs. Notably, in a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation, PhenoPLIER successfully highlighted functionally
          significant genes that lacked direct associations but were central
          within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
          our ability to interpret genetic associations beyond single-gene
          analyses, offering a more comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may
          facilitate drug repurposing. This approach represents a significant
          step forward in the clustering of complex traits and the
          identification of novel intervention points within the intricate
          network of gene expression.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill

          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, yet contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational
          methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for unveiling
          disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of
          individual genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in the
          manifestation and progression of diseases remains underexplored. This
          gap hinders the development of new therapies that could benefit from a
          more comprehensive view of gene networks. Here we present PhenoPLIER,
          an innovative computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological
          data, creating a unified latent space for analysis. Our method reveals
          that disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed in
          relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of predicting known
          drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
          Notably, PhenoPLIER successfully identifies key regulatory genes that,
          despite lacking direct associations, are implicated in
          trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen focused
          on lipid regulation. In conclusion, our findings underscore the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in pinpointing potential therapeutic targets and
          facilitating drug repurposing, thereby advancing the clustering of
          complex traits and contributing to a deeper understanding of disease
          mechanisms and treatment strategies.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of

          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that diseases are markedly linked to gene clusters expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in identifying
          established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          identified key functional genes that, despite lacking direct
          associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene clusters by
          PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
          targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies, as it overlooks the potential of gene co-expression
          patterns to elucidate disease origins and progression. Here, we
          present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that
          leverages gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations to
          construct a shared latent space for simultaneous analysis. By
          identifying modules of co-expressed genes under similar conditions,
          PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our results demonstrate the
          method's precision in confirming known drug-disease relationships and
          in deducing drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally critical genes that traditional associations might miss.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic
          underpinnings of complex traits but also offers a promising avenue for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing, thereby
          advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

          Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding their collective influence on complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation
          under varying conditions. Such understanding is pivotal for the
          innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to the genesis
          and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed
          from clusters of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our
          findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates
          precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and

          lipid regulation screen indicates that key functional genes, despite
          lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated
          gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in identifying
          therapeutic targets and opportunities for drug repurposing.

          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern

          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the quest to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of complex traits
          and diseases, current research has highlighted the importance of
          gene-gene interactions and the regulation of gene expression across
          various conditions. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association
          studies, a comprehensive understanding of how these interactions
          contribute to disease etiology and inform therapeutic development
          remains elusive. Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER,
          a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological data to uncover the latent structure
          of gene co-expression. Here we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively
          identifies modules of co-expressed genes that are significantly
          associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our results show that
          this method not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships but also reveals potential mechanisms of action for drug
          repurposing. Moreover, by applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen
          focused on lipid regulation, we highlight key genetic players that,
          despite lacking direct associations, are implicated in
          disease-relevant pathways. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and offers
          a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets, thereby paving
          the way for novel drug discovery and repurposing strategies.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the
          innovation of new therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease associations are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct
          associations can still be critical and are identified within
          trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its
          potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
          repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms, yet contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational
          methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease states are significantly correlated with gene clusters
          active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
          action mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations can be
          critical and are identified within trait-associated gene clusters by
          PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing therapeutic
          targets.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of
          individual genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in the
          development and progression of diseases remains underexplored. This
          gap hinders the advancement of new treatment strategies, emphasizing
          the need for a comprehensive approach to capture the multifaceted
          nature of gene regulation. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological data within a unified latent space, facilitating the
          simultaneous analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our findings
          reveal that diseases correlate significantly with gene modules
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
          drug mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize
          functionally critical genes that traditional association studies might
          overlook. In conclusion, our study not only bridges a crucial
          knowledge gap by highlighting the collective influence of gene
          networks on disease processes but also paves the way for drug
          repurposing and the discovery of therapeutic targets, thereby
          propelling the field of functional genomics towards a more integrative
          understanding of complex traits.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. Our method shows proficiency in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen
              to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking
              direct associations yet playing functional roles are identified
              within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
              expression modules.

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in
              specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how
              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal for
              advancing therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual gene
              contributions to disease mechanisms, the significance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology remains underexplored. This gap
              hinders the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the
              repurposing of existing drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that leverages gene expression
              patterns to project genetic associations onto a unified latent
              space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological data. Our method identifies modules of
              co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              pertinent to relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships but also elucidates
              potential mechanisms of action. For instance, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER can
              prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in our understanding of
              gene networks in disease by contextualizing genetic associations
              within co-expression frameworks, thereby uncovering therapeutic
              targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach
              holds promise for enhancing drug discovery and repurposing by
              illuminating the complex clustering of traits at the molecular
              level.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters
              of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations
              yet functionally significant are identified within
              trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This
              novel framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting
              genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is
              pivotal for advancing disease etiology and identifying therapeutic
              targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the roles of individual genes, the intricate web of
              gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease manifestation
              remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies that could benefit from a more comprehensive view of
              gene function. Addressing this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to
              bridge genetic studies and pharmacological data, offering a
              unified analysis of gene-trait associations. PhenoPLIER constructs
              a latent space representation based on co-expression modules,
              enabling the identification of disease associations with gene
              clusters active in relevant cell types. Our findings demonstrate
              that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and elucidates drug mechanisms of action. Notably, a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can
              prioritize functionally significant genes that traditional
              single-gene analyses often overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              enhances our ability to interpret genetic associations by
              considering the collective behavior of gene modules, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
              repurposing. This approach represents a significant stride in
              clustering complex traits, with broad implications for functional
              genomics and the development of precision medicine.

              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules
              of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves
              effective in accurately predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet
              functionally significant are identified within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters
              of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations,
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between genes and their role in complex traits is pivotal for
              advancing therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual gene
              contributions to disease mechanisms, the significance of gene-gene
              interactions in the etiology of diseases remains underexplored.
              This gap hinders the identification of novel therapeutic targets
              and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a unified
              latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological data. Our method clusters genes
              into modules based on co-expression across various conditions,
              enabling the identification of disease-associated modules and the
              prediction of drug-disease relationships. Our results demonstrate
              that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally significant genes that lack direct associations,
              underscoring the utility of our module-based approach. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic studies and
              functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for contextualizing
              genetic associations within gene modules and uncovering elusive
              therapeutic targets. This framework not only enhances our
              understanding of disease etiology but also opens new avenues for
              drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential

              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is
              pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
              therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the significance
              of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains
              underexplored. This gap hinders the advancement of novel
              treatments and drug repurposing strategies. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a unified
              latent space, facilitating the simultaneous analysis of gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbations. Our method employs
              co-expression modules to capture the concerted action of genes
              across various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
              we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important
              genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by
              contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses

              discovery and repurposing by providing a more comprehensive view
              of gene function and interaction in complex traits.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated
              with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and
              elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
              identify key functional genes that, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a unique
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene expression modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is
              pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
              therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the significance
              of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains
              underexplored. Addressing this gap, our study introduces
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to bridge genetic associations with disease
              mechanisms and drug responses. PhenoPLIER integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent space,
              based on co-expression modules, facilitating a comprehensive
              analysis. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
              and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can
              prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations, underscoring the utility of our method in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only
              contextualizes genetic associations within gene modules but also
              advances our understanding of complex trait clustering and drug
              repurposing, offering a robust framework for functional genomics
              research and the development of precision medicine.

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and
              progression of complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of
              genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. The accuracy of PhenoPLIER is evident in its ability
              to predict established drug-disease relationships and deduce
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes key
              functional genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are
              embedded within trait-associated gene modules.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing our ability
              to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene modules, paving the way for
              improved understanding of disease etiology and the identification
              of novel drug mechanisms.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they
              fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that
              underpin complex trait architectures. This gap hinders the
              development of new therapies and the repurposing of existing
              drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological data within a unified latent
              space for comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages gene
              co-expression modules, which reflect concerted gene activity
              across various conditions, to illuminate the genetic underpinnings
              of diseases and their connection to cellular contexts. Our
              findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and deciphers drug mechanisms of
              action. Notably, it also identifies key regulatory genes that,
              despite lacking direct associations, are implicated in
              trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen focused
              on lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends the
              limitations of single-gene approaches by providing a framework
              that situates genetic associations within the context of gene
              modules, thereby uncovering novel disease etiologies and potential
              therapeutic targets. This advancement propels the field of
              functional genomics forward by offering a more nuanced
              understanding of gene expression patterns in relation to complex
              diseases and drug mechanisms.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts
              to execute their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal to the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the
              foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent expression
              patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate a
              significant correlation between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately
              predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that lack direct associations within
              trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages
              clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic
              associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel
              framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they
              fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that
              underpin the architecture of complex traits and their progression.
              This gap hinders the development of new therapies and the
              repurposing of existing drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to construct a latent representation, enabling the joint
              analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbations. Our method reveals significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers
              mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen
              focused on lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the
              gap in our understanding of genetic associations by integrating
              co-expressed gene clusters, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
              framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic data,
              with broad implications for drug discovery and the clustering of
              complex traits.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of
              genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our analysis reveals that disease states are
              significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively
              prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes that lack
              direct associations but are functionally significant.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic data
              through the prism of gene modules, providing insights into disease
              etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they
              fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that
              underpin the architecture of complex traits. This gap hinders the
              development of new therapies and the repurposing of existing
              drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent
              representation, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene
              co-expression networks. PhenoPLIER leverages modules of
              co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations with
              diseases in relevant cell types and accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Our findings
              include the identification of key regulatory genes in lipid
              metabolism through a CRISPR screen, which, despite lacking direct
              associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation in disease but also
              uncovers potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by
              single-gene approaches. This framework represents a significant
              step forward in the interpretation of genetic associations,
              offering new avenues for drug repurposing and the clustering of
              complex traits.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait correlations with pharmacological
              perturbation data within a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific biological contexts to
              execute their functions, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal
              for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic
              development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene
              modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns
              under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases
              are significantly linked to gene modules active in pertinent cell
              types. The accuracy of PhenoPLIER is demonstrated by its
              successful prediction of established drug-disease relationships
              and its ability to deduce mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation identified key functional
              genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
              within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends traditional single-gene
              approaches by integrating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby
              providing a more comprehensive context for genetic associations
              and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be
              overlooked. This novel framework offers a transformative
              perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
              prism of gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease
              etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our

              This gap hinders the development of new therapies and the

              novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to construct a latent representation, enabling the joint
              analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological

              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,

              mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen
              focused on lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the
              gap in current genetic studies by contextualizing genetic
              associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. This
              framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations, with broad implications for disease understanding
              and drug discovery, including drug repurposing.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases.


              PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of
              genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our analysis reveals that disease states are
              significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug action
              mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes
              trait-associated modules, even for genes that lack direct
              associations yet are functionally significant.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by
              integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the
              interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This
              framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic data
              through the prism of gene modules, providing insights into disease
              etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they
              fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that
              underpin complex trait architectures and disease progression.
              Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to project genetic associations and pharmacological data into a
              unified latent space, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of
              gene networks. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes
              under similar conditions, enabling the identification of disease
              associations with gene clusters expressed in relevant cell types.
              Our results demonstrate the method's precision in predicting known
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed
              that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant
              genes that lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of
              our gene module-based approach. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              transcends the limitations of single-gene analyses by
              contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be
              overlooked. This framework represents a significant stride in the
              pursuit of drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits,
              offering a new vantage point for functional genomics research.

              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that genes
              of functional significance, despite lacking direct associations,
              are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool,
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
              co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              uncovering disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              However, current genetic studies often overlook the collective
              influence of co-expressed gene clusters, potentially missing key
              insights into disease mechanisms and drug efficacy. Addressing
              this gap, our research leverages a novel analytical framework,
              PhenoPLIER, to elucidate the relationship between gene modules and
              complex traits within relevant cellular contexts. Here we
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of
              action. Notably, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              revealed that PhenoPLIER successfully prioritizes functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends the
              limitations of single-gene strategies by integrating co-expression
              patterns to contextualize genetic associations, thereby
              illuminating potential therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
              repurposing. This approach advances our understanding of genetic
              underpinnings in disease and opens new avenues for targeted

              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to execute their functions. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules that are expressed in pertinent cell
              types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid regulation, we discovered
              that certain functionally critical genes, although not directly
              associated with traits, are nevertheless highlighted within
              trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
              provide context to genetic associations, thereby uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework offers
              a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations via gene
              expression patterns, enhancing our understanding of disease
              etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              unveiling disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic
              targets. However, current genetic studies often overlook the
              collective influence of co-expressed gene clusters, thereby
              missing key insights into disease mechanisms and potential drug
              interventions. Addressing this gap, our research leverages a novel
              analytical framework, PhenoPLIER, to elucidate the relationship
              between gene modules and complex traits within relevant cellular
              contexts. Here we demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              deciphers their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employ a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing that
              PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally important genes
              that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated
              modules. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PhenoPLIER
              successfully contextualizes genetic associations by focusing on
              gene expression patterns, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that single-gene approaches may overlook. This advancement
              in functional genomics not only enhances our understanding of
              disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing
              and the identification of clustering of complex traits.

              integrating gene modules, thereby enhancing our ability to
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover therapeutic targets
              that may otherwise be overlooked. This advancement holds promise
              for refining our understanding of disease etiology and
              accelerating the discovery of drug mechanisms and repurposing
              opportunities.

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to execute their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules that are expressed in pertinent cell
              types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid regulation, we discovered
              that certain genes of functional importance, despite lacking
              direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated
              modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to
              genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches.
              This innovative framework offers a new perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations via gene expression patterns,
              enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the
              orchestration of gene expression is pivotal for elucidating the
              molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases, yet
              current approaches often overlook the collective influence of gene
              networks. This gap hinders the identification of therapeutic
              targets and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to enhance the interpretation of genetic
              associations with diseases. Our study demonstrates that disease
              etiology is closely linked to gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Notably,
              our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally significant genes that
              traditional single-gene association studies might miss. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic studies and
              functional genomics, offering a powerful tool for identifying
              disease etiology and informing drug discovery. By focusing on gene
              modules rather than individual genes, PhenoPLIER sets the stage
              for more effective therapeutic targeting and drug repurposing,
              thereby advancing the clustering of complex traits and the quest
              for precision medicine.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              uncovering disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic
              targets. However, current genetic studies often overlook the
              collective influence of co-expressed gene clusters, potentially
              missing key insights into disease mechanisms and drug actions.
              This study bridges this gap by leveraging gene expression patterns
              to enhance the projection of genetic associations onto disease
              processes and drug mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational framework that integrates co-expression
              networks with genetic data to elucidate the role of gene modules
              in disease manifestation and treatment efficacy. Our findings
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and uncovers the mechanisms of action for various
              drugs. Notably, in a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation,
              PhenoPLIER successfully highlighted functionally significant genes
              that lacked direct associations but were central within
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              ability to interpret genetic associations beyond single-gene
              analyses, offering a more comprehensive understanding of disease
              etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may
              facilitate drug repurposing. This approach represents a
              significant step forward in the clustering of complex traits and
              the identification of novel intervention points within the
              intricate network of gene expression.

              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              unveiling disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic
              targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the roles of individual genes, the significance of
              gene-gene interactions in the manifestation and progression of
              diseases remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development
              of new therapies that could benefit from a more comprehensive view
              of gene networks. Here we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data,
              creating a unified latent space for analysis. Our method reveals
              that disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed
              in relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of predicting known
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Notably, PhenoPLIER successfully identifies key regulatory
              genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are implicated in
              trait-associated modules, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen
              focused on lipid regulation. In conclusion, our findings
              underscore the utility of PhenoPLIER in pinpointing potential
              therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby
              advancing the clustering of complex traits and contributing to a
              deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and treatment
              strategies.

              therapies, as it overlooks the potential of gene co-expression
              patterns to elucidate disease origins and progression. Here, we
              present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that
              leverages gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations
              to construct a shared latent space for simultaneous analysis. By
              identifying modules of co-expressed genes under similar
              conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our
              results demonstrate the method's precision in confirming known
              drug-disease relationships and in deducing drugs' mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              highlights that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally critical
              genes that traditional associations might miss. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic underpinnings of
              complex traits but also offers a promising avenue for therapeutic
              target identification and drug repurposing, thereby advancing the
              fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

              Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their
              biological roles, and understanding their collective influence on
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions. Such understanding
              is pivotal for the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on

              In the quest to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of complex
              traits and diseases, current research has highlighted the
              importance of gene-gene interactions and the regulation of gene
              expression across various conditions. Despite advances in
              transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive
              understanding of how these interactions contribute to disease
              etiology and inform therapeutic development remains elusive.
              Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological data to uncover the latent structure of gene
              co-expression. Here we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively
              identifies modules of co-expressed genes that are significantly
              associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our results show
              that this method not only accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships but also reveals potential mechanisms of action for
              drug repurposing. Moreover, by applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR
              screen focused on lipid regulation, we highlight key genetic
              players that, despite lacking direct associations, are implicated
              in disease-relevant pathways. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
              our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits
              and offers a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets,
              thereby paving the way for novel drug discovery and repurposing
              strategies.

              In the quest to elucidate the mechanisms underlying complex traits
              and diseases, current research has highlighted the importance of
              gene-gene interactions and their expression regulation across
              various conditions. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide
              association studies, a comprehensive understanding of how these
              interactions contribute to disease etiology and potential
              therapeutic interventions remains elusive. Addressing this gap,
              our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data
              to uncover the latent structure of gene co-expression. Here we
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively identifies modules of
              co-expressed genes, which are significantly associated with
              diseases in relevant cell types. Our results show that this method
              not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but
              also reveals potential mechanisms of action for drug repurposing.
              Moreover, by applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen focused on
              lipid regulation, we highlight key genes that, despite lacking
              direct associations, are implicated in disease-relevant pathways.
              In conclusion, our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER offers a
              powerful tool for dissecting the genetic architecture of complex
              traits, advancing our understanding of disease etiology, and
              identifying novel therapeutic targets, thereby propelling the
              field of functional genomics and drug discovery forward.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence

              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, yet
              contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
              study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework
              for combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters
              of co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings
              reveal that disease states are significantly correlated with gene
              clusters active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates
              precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing drug action mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking
              direct associations can be critical and are identified within
              trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic
              targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the roles of individual genes, the significance of
              gene-gene interactions in the development and progression of
              diseases remains underexplored. This gap hinders the advancement
              of new treatment strategies, emphasizing the need for a
              comprehensive approach to capture the multifaceted nature of gene
              regulation. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological data within a unified latent space, facilitating
              the simultaneous analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our
              findings reveal that diseases correlate significantly with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates
              precision in predicting established drug-disease relationships and

              investigating lipid regulation highlights that PhenoPLIER can
              prioritize functionally critical genes that traditional

              only bridges a crucial knowledge gap by highlighting the
              collective influence of gene networks on disease processes but
              also paves the way for drug repurposing and the discovery of
              therapeutic targets, thereby propelling the field of functional
              genomics towards a more integrative understanding of complex
              traits.
