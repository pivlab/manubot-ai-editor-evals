          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process
          pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless,
          contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This space is
          constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under consistent
          conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships
          and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
          employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal
          that genes lacking direct associations yet functionally significant
          are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.
          This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting
          genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to
          project genetic associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating
          the joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          data. By analyzing modules of co-expressed genes across various
          conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes
          functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are
          implicated in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits by
          highlighting the importance of gene co-expression networks. This
          framework not only contextualizes genetic associations beyond
          single-gene analyses but also uncovers potential therapeutic targets
          for drug repurposing, thereby offering a powerful tool for functional
          genomics and precision medicine.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored.
          This gap hinders the advancement of new treatments and the repurposing
          of existing drugs. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that leverages gene expression data and pharmacological
          perturbations to uncover the underlying mechanisms of diseases and
          potential drug effects. PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where
          gene-trait associations and drug action are jointly analyzed, based on
          co-expression modules that capture the coordinated activity of genes
          across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that disease traits
          are significantly associated with gene modules active in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and provides insights into drug mechanisms. Additionally, our approach
          identifies key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct
          associations with traits, are implicated in disease-relevant pathways
          through their module connections, as validated by a CRISPR screen
          focused on lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of complex diseases by integrating gene co-expression
          patterns, thereby highlighting overlooked therapeutic targets and
          offering a powerful tool for drug repurposing. This approach has broad
          implications for functional genomics and the clustering of complex
          traits, propelling the field towards more holistic models of genetic
          influence on disease.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits. Such
          insight is pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
          interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
          Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          are fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent
          space is constructed upon clusters of genes that exhibit coherent
          expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Our method shows proficiency in accurately
          predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to
          investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes of functional
          significance, despite lacking direct associations, are identified
          within trait-associated clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers an
          innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          prism of gene expression modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying

          identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions,
          revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules

          action but also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          highlights functionally important genes that lack direct associations

          PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic contributions to
          disease by integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering
          potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might
          overlook. This approach offers a powerful framework for drug
          repurposing and the identification of novel drug mechanisms, thereby
          informing functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to
          fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
          elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in
          the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and
          progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
          combined analysis. This space is constructed upon modules of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a
          CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally critical genes that lack direct
          associations within trait-related modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER
          leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework
          offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through
          the prism of gene expression modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of
          gene-gene interactions to disease development remains underexplored.
          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a
          unified latent space, based on co-expression modules. Our analysis
          reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
          demonstrates that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
          understanding of genetic associations by highlighting the importance
          of gene modules, thereby offering new insights into disease mechanisms
          and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach has the potential to
          uncover therapeutic targets that are not evident through single-gene
          analysis, moving the field of functional genomics forward.

          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex
          traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes, the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored.
          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          leverages gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations to
          project genetic associations into a unified latent space. This space
          is defined by modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions,
          facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully
          prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations
          but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances
          our ability to interpret genetic associations by integrating
          co-expression patterns, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This framework holds
          promise for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits,
          offering a new perspective on functional genomics.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of
          complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the
          foundation of gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated
          expression patterns under consistent conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
          modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally significant genes that lack direct associations,
          underscoring its ability to identify potential targets that
          single-gene approaches may overlook. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages
          the collective behavior of co-expressed gene groups to contextualize
          genetic associations, thereby unveiling potential therapeutic targets
          through the prism of gene modules. This novel framework offers a
          transformative perspective for interpreting genetic associations in
          the realm of functional genomics.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages a latent
          representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbations for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER capitalizes on gene
          co-expression modules, reflecting concerted gene activity across
          various conditions, to interpret complex trait associations. Our
          findings demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly
          associated with diseases in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that
          lack direct associations, underscoring the utility of our method in
          identifying potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework that enriches our
          understanding of genetic associations by integrating gene expression
          patterns, thereby advancing the discovery of disease mechanisms and
          facilitating drug repurposing. This approach promises to propel the
          field of functional genomics towards a more holistic understanding of
          gene function in disease and therapeutic intervention.

          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its
          framework on the foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent
          expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate a significant correlation between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally significant genes that lack direct associations within
          trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends
          single-gene analysis by integrating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          thereby enhancing the interpretation of genetic associations and
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be
          overlooked. This novel approach offers a powerful framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression
          modules, providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug
          repurposing efforts.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to bridge genetic studies and pharmacological data within a
          unified latent space, enabling a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs
          modules of co-expressed genes under similar conditions, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the method's precision
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deciphering drug mechanisms
          of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
          direct associations, underscoring its ability to identify potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          advances our understanding of genetic associations by contextualizing
          them within gene modules, thereby offering a novel framework that has
          broad implications for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex
          traits.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to bridge genetic studies and pharmacological data within a
          unified latent space, enabling a joint analysis of gene-trait
          associations. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes,
          revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the
          approach's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring drug mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important genes that lack direct associations, underscoring its
          ability to identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of
          genetic associations by contextualizing them within gene modules,
          thereby offering a novel framework that has broad implications for
          drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          influences and advancing therapeutic development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology
          and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its
          framework on the foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent
          expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate a significant correlation between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in
          accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          elucidating drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
          investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally significant genes that lack direct associations within
          trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of
          co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations, thereby
          uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene approaches
          may overlook. This novel framework offers a unique perspective for
          interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, enhancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing
          efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes
          collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological
          roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait
          etiologies and developing novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual
          genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the genesis and progression of
          complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from
          clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under
          identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate significant
          correlations between disease states and gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately predicting
          established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          significant genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in
          trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
          collective behavior of co-expressed gene groups to contextualize
          genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
          that single-gene approaches may overlook. This framework offers a
          novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the
          prism of gene expression modules, enhancing our understanding of
          disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
          between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating
          disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Despite advances
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive model
          integrating gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease
          progression remains elusive. Addressing this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbations into a unified latent space for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of co-expressed genes, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate the approach's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug
          mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations, underscoring its ability to identify
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework that enhances our understanding of
          genetic associations by contextualizing them within gene modules,
          thereby advancing the discovery of disease mechanisms and facilitating
          drug repurposing. This approach promises to refine the clustering of
          complex traits and accelerate the identification of novel therapeutic
          targets.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screen investigating lipid
          metabolism, we discovered that certain genes of functional
          significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
          within trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In
          summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
          interpret genetic associations, thereby unveiling potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis
          approaches. This innovative framework provided by PhenoPLIER offers a
          new perspective for understanding genetic contributions to disease
          etiology and identifying drug mechanisms, with implications for drug
          repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a

          gene expression regulation across various conditions remains elusive.
          This gap hinders the identification of novel drug targets and the

          provide evidence of PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting established
          drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug actions. Notably, our
          CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER
          successfully prioritizes functionally critical genes that lack direct
          associations, thereby overcoming limitations of single-gene analysis.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for contextualizing
          genetic associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. This framework
          propels the field of functional genomics forward by providing a more
          nuanced understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we
          discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not
          directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation of
          genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression
          modules to provide insights into disease etiology and inform drug
          discovery and repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to interpret
          genetic associations within the context of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond what is achievable with
          single-gene analyses. Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
          reveals that while some functionally important genes lack direct
          associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional
          genomics by contextualizing genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and
          uncovering therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional
          methods. This framework has broad implications for enhancing our
          understanding of complex traits and streamlining drug repurposing
          efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a
          comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains
          elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets
          and repurpose existing drugs. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to
          interpret genetic associations within the context of disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis
          of lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important
          genes lack direct associations, they are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER transcends
          traditional single-gene strategies by integrating co-expressed gene
          clusters, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets and
          providing insights into the molecular underpinnings of diseases. This
          approach not only contextualizes genetic associations but also opens
          avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets, propelling the field of functional genomics
          forward.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to
          fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
          development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates
          that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology
          exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease
          relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid
          regulation, we discovered that certain functionally critical genes,
          although not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the
          utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation of
          genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression
          modules to provide insights into disease etiology and inform drug
          repurposing strategies.

          Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in complex
          traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet current
          approaches often overlook the coordinated expression patterns that
          underlie disease mechanisms. This gap hinders the identification of
          novel drug targets and the repurposing of existing therapies. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages
          gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of
          diseases and inform drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
          disease associations are significantly correlated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights
          beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses. For instance, our
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes,
          while not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap
          between genetic studies and functional genomics, providing a powerful
          tool for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
          repurposing. By integrating gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER
          enhances our understanding of disease etiology and opens new avenues
          for precision medicine.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated

          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation
          across various conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of
          these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of
          novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease
          pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene modules expressed
          in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing
          their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
          CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that certain
          functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
          traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool,
          PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative
          framework for interpreting genetic associations by integrating
          co-expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating the
          etiology of complex traits and developing new therapeutic
          interventions. However, the current landscape of genetic studies often
          overlooks the collective influence of co-expressed gene modules, which
          may be crucial for identifying disease associations and drug
          mechanisms. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project
          genetic associations onto relevant cell types and infer drug-disease
          relationships. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action,
          while also identifying functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are implicated in disease through trait-associated
          modules. This is further substantiated by a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between
          single-gene strategies and the complex reality of gene networks,
          offering a powerful tool for uncovering therapeutic targets and
          facilitating drug repurposing. By integrating gene modules into the
          analysis of genetic associations, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our
          understanding of disease etiology but also propels the field of
          functional genomics towards more comprehensive and effective
          strategies for intervention.

          Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation
          across various conditions is essential for elucidating the influence
          of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel

          shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
          mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational
          methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a
          significant correlation between diseases and gene clusters expressed
          in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation identified key functional genes that, despite lacking
          direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
          expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of complex
          traits and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent
          space where gene modules with coherent expression profiles are
          associated with diseases and drug responses. Our results demonstrate
          that disease traits are significantly linked to gene modules active in
          relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships and sheds light on potential mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation reveals
          that while some functionally important genes do not show direct
          associations, they are implicated in disease through their presence in
          trait-associated modules. This approach not only refines our
          understanding of disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug
          repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets,
          thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and the clustering
          of complex traits.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill
          their biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
          regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the
          influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development
          of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings reveal
          that disease states are significantly linked to gene clusters
          expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision
          in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
          drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations
          can be critical and are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies that could target these interactions. To address this, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages
          gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent space, enabling the joint analysis of gene
          modules with coherent expression profiles across various conditions.
          Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach demonstrates
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug

          repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets,
          thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision
          medicine.

          Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under
          varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes
          on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel
          therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
          mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational
          methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a
          significant correlation between diseases and gene clusters expressed
          in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation highlighted that genes lacking direct associations,
          yet crucial for function, are identified within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies that could target these interactions. To address this, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages
          gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. By
          integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent representation that captures the
          relationship between gene modules and complex traits. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
          offering insights into drug repurposing opportunities. Additionally,
          our approach successfully prioritizes functionally important genes
          that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated
          modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation.
          This study not only sheds light on the genetic underpinnings of
          disease but also provides a powerful tool for identifying novel
          therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the fields of functional
          genomics and precision medicine.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological
          roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation
          across various conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of
          these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of
          novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
          diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for
          combined analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
          co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a
          significant correlation between diseases and gene clusters expressed
          in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates precision in
          identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation identified key functional genes that, despite lacking
          direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene
          clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its potential in pinpointing
          therapeutic targets.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
          understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
          complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
          therapies that could target these interactions. To address this, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages
          gene expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
          complex traits and identify potential therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent space, enabling the analysis of gene
          co-expression modules under various conditions. Our results
          demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights
          into drug repurposing opportunities. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes
          lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules, underscoring the utility of our approach. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on the genetic underpinnings of
          complex diseases but also provides a powerful tool for identifying
          novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby
          advancing the fields of functional genomics and precision medicine.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This space is constructed upon modules of
              co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates
              potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that
              genes lacking direct associations yet functionally significant are
              identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene
              expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease
              development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations
              onto a shared latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. By analyzing
              modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, we
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated
              in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our
              understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits by
              highlighting the importance of gene co-expression networks. This
              framework not only contextualizes genetic associations beyond
              single-gene analyses but also uncovers potential therapeutic
              targets for drug repurposing, thereby offering a powerful tool for
              functional genomics and precision medicine.

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters
              of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we identify functionally critical genes that,
              despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within
              trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This
              innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting
              genetic associations via gene expression modules, enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and
              repurposing efforts.

              that leverages gene expression data and pharmacological
              perturbations to uncover the underlying mechanisms of diseases and
              potential drug effects. PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space where
              gene-trait associations and drug action are jointly analyzed,
              based on co-expression modules that capture the coordinated
              activity of genes across various conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that disease traits are significantly associated with
              gene modules active in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships and provides insights

              module connections, as validated by a CRISPR screen focused on
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our

            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits.
              Such insight is pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic
              interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the contributions of individual genes to disease
              mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space
              for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon
              clusters of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. Our method shows proficiency in accurately predicting
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we reveal that genes of functional significance,
              despite lacking direct associations, are identified within
              trait-associated clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER
              offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              development remains underexplored. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that leverages gene expression
              patterns to project genetic associations onto a unified latent
              space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological data. Our method identifies modules of
              co-expressed genes across various conditions, revealing
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of
              action but also, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
              highlights functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations yet are implicated in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
              contributions to disease by integrating co-expression networks,
              thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene
              analyses might overlook. This approach offers a powerful framework
              for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug
              mechanisms, thereby informing functional genomics and the

              Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts
              to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential
              for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for
              combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon clusters
              of genes that exhibit coordinated expression patterns under
              identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent
              cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate
              lipid regulation, we discover that genes lacking direct
              associations yet playing functional roles are highlighted within
              trait-associated clusters by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel
              framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

              Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of
              complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              development remains underexplored. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach that leverages gene expression data
              and pharmacological perturbations to project genetic associations
              into a unified latent space. This space is defined by modules of
              co-expressed genes across various conditions, facilitating the
              joint analysis of gene-trait associations. Our results demonstrate
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease relationships and provides insights into drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully
              prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as
              evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER advances our ability to interpret genetic associations
              by integrating co-expression patterns, thereby uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might
              overlook. This framework holds promise for drug repurposing and
              the clustering of complex traits, offering a new perspective on
              functional genomics.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
              disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of complex
              diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of
              gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression
              patterns under consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate
              that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules
              active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately
              predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
              associations, underscoring its ability to identify potential
              targets that single-gene approaches may overlook. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages the collective behavior of co-expressed gene
              groups to contextualize genetic associations, thereby unveiling
              potential therapeutic targets through the prism of gene modules.
              This novel framework offers a transformative perspective for
              interpreting genetic associations in the realm of functional
              genomics.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages a latent representation of gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbations for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER
              capitalizes on gene co-expression modules, reflecting concerted
              gene activity across various conditions, to interpret complex
              trait associations. Our findings demonstrate that these gene
              modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant
              cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers drug mechanisms of action. Notably,
              a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations, underscoring the utility of our method in
              identifying potential targets overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework
              that enriches our understanding of genetic associations by
              integrating gene expression patterns, thereby advancing the
              discovery of disease mechanisms and facilitating drug repurposing.
              This approach promises to propel the field of functional genomics
              towards a more holistic understanding of gene function in disease
              and therapeutic intervention.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the
              foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent expression
              patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate a
              significant correlation between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately
              predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
              associations within trait-associated modules. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating clusters
              of co-expressed genes, thereby enhancing the interpretation of
              genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that may otherwise be overlooked. This novel approach offers a
              powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the prism of gene expression modules, providing insights into
              disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

              expression regulation under varying conditions—a critical factor
              for the development of novel therapeutics. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the
              etiology and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER
              constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules that
              exhibit coherent expression patterns across identical conditions.
              Our findings indicate a significant correlation between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The
              methodology demonstrates precision in identifying established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
              regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes within trait-associated modules, even when these
              genes do not show direct associations. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to
              genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel
              framework offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic
              associations through the prism of gene expression modules,
              enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug
              repurposing efforts.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to bridge genetic studies
              and pharmacological data within a unified latent space, enabling a
              joint analysis of gene-trait associations. PhenoPLIER constructs
              modules of co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms
              of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              highlighted that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
              genes that lack direct associations, underscoring its ability to
              identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic
              associations by contextualizing them within gene modules, thereby
              offering a novel framework that has broad implications for drug
              repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing
              therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes
              to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of
              complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the
              foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent expression
              patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate a
              significant correlation between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately
              predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen
              investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct
              associations within trait-associated modules. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide
              context to genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene approaches may overlook. This
              novel framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting
              genetic associations via gene modules, enhancing our understanding
              of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology
              that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined
              analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute
              their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is
              essential for elucidating complex trait etiologies and developing
              novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to
              disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the genesis and progression of complex
              diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from
              clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under
              identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate significant
              correlations between disease states and gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately predicting
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating
              lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              significant genes that lack direct associations but are embedded
              in trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the
              collective behavior of co-expressed gene groups to contextualize
              genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic
              targets that single-gene approaches may overlook. This framework
              offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations
              through the prism of gene expression modules, enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing
              efforts.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay
              between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for
              elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
              Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
              comprehensive model integrating gene-gene interactions and their
              implications for disease progression remains elusive. Addressing
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified
              latent space for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER constructs modules of
              co-expressed genes, revealing significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              results demonstrate the approach's accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms of action.
              Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
              direct associations, underscoring its ability to identify
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework that enhances our
              understanding of genetic associations by contextualizing them
              within gene modules, thereby advancing the discovery of disease
              mechanisms and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach
              promises to refine the clustering of complex traits and accelerate
              the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based screen investigating lipid metabolism, we discovered
              that certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking
              direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated
              modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to interpret genetic
              associations, thereby unveiling potential therapeutic targets that
              may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This
              innovative framework provided by PhenoPLIER offers a new
              perspective for understanding genetic contributions to disease
              etiology and identifying drug mechanisms, with implications for
              drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in

              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate the mechanistic

              uncovering therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing.
              This framework propels the field of functional genomics forward by

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to
              elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based lipid regulation screen, we discovered that certain
              functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with
              traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our
              tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked
              by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers
              an innovative framework for the interpretation of genetic
              associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression modules
              to provide insights into disease etiology and inform drug
              discovery and repurposing efforts.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship
              remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel
              drug targets and repurpose existing therapies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to interpret genetic associations within the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering
              insights beyond what is achievable with single-gene analyses.
              Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that while
              some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they
              are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by
              contextualizing genetic associations through gene expression
              patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and uncovering
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by conventional
              methods. This framework has broad implications for enhancing our
              understanding of complex traits and streamlining drug repurposing
              efforts.

              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,

              Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts
              to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene
              expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for
              elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a
              cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.
              Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly
              correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
              Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying
              established drug-disease relationships and deducing their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR-based investigation into lipid regulation, we discovered
              that certain functionally critical genes, although not directly
              associated with traits, are highlighted within trait-associated
              modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of
              PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets that may
              be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation
              of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene
              co-expression modules to provide insights into disease etiology
              and inform drug repurposing strategies.

              Understanding the interplay between genes and their role in
              complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies,
              yet current approaches often overlook the coordinated expression
              patterns that underlie disease mechanisms. This gap hinders the
              identification of novel drug targets and the repurposing of
              existing therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to elucidate the genetic underpinnings of diseases and inform drug
              mechanisms. Our study demonstrates that disease associations are
              significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights beyond
              what is achievable with single-gene analyses. For instance, our
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that key functional
              genes, while not directly associated with traits, are highlighted
              within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges
              the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, providing
              a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and
              facilitating drug repurposing. By integrating gene co-expression
              networks, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of disease
              etiology and opens new avenues for precision medicine.

              Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of gene expression
              regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating
              the etiology of complex traits and developing new therapeutic
              interventions. However, the current landscape of genetic studies
              often overlooks the collective influence of co-expressed gene
              modules, which may be crucial for identifying disease associations
              and drug mechanisms. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns
              to project genetic associations onto relevant cell types and infer

              functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are

              offering a powerful tool for uncovering therapeutic targets and
              facilitating drug repurposing. By integrating gene modules into

              our understanding of disease etiology but also propels the field
              of functional genomics towards more comprehensive and effective

              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their
              biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
              regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating
              the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
              development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the
              etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
              integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined
              analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
              co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
              a significant correlation between diseases and gene clusters
              expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates
              precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation identified key functional
              genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
              within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains underexplored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene
              expression patterns to elucidate the genetic architecture of
              complex traits and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating
              gene-trait associations with pharmacological data, PhenoPLIER
              constructs a latent space where gene modules with coherent
              expression profiles are associated with diseases and drug
              responses. Our results demonstrate that disease traits are
              significantly linked to gene modules active in relevant cell
              types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and sheds light on potential mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation
              reveals that while some functionally important genes do not show
              direct associations, they are implicated in disease through their
              presence in trait-associated modules. This approach not only
              refines our understanding of disease etiology but also opens new
              avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of novel
              therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional
              genomics and the clustering of complex traits.

              Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their

              the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies that could target these interactions. To address this,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the genetic
              architecture of complex traits and identify potential therapeutic
              targets. By integrating gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data, PhenoPLIER constructs a latent
              representation that captures the relationship between gene modules
              and complex traits. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action, offering insights into drug
              repurposing opportunities. Additionally, our approach successfully
              prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
              associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as
              evidenced by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. This

              but also provides a powerful tool for identifying novel
              therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the fields of functional

              architecture of complex traits and identify potential therapeutic
              targets. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space,
              enabling the analysis of gene co-expression modules under various
              conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action, offering insights into drug
              repurposing opportunities. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
              important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated
              in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our findings highlight
              the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering the molecular
              underpinnings of diseases and facilitating the identification of
              novel drug mechanisms, thereby advancing the fields of functional
              genomics and precision medicine.

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their
              biological roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression
              regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate the
              influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the
              development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the contributions of
              individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the
              etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
              integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined
              analysis. This framework is constructed upon clusters of
              co-expressed genes under identical conditions. Our findings reveal
              a significant correlation between diseases and gene clusters
              expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates
              precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships
              and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR
              screen investigating lipid regulation identified key functional
              genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted
              within trait-associated gene clusters by PhenoPLIER, underscoring
              its potential in pinpointing therapeutic targets.

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our
              understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the
              complex interplay of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new
              therapies that could target these interactions. To address this,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
