A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet functionally significant are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.">[PASS] (1.00) Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a shared latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. By analyzing modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression networks. This framework not only contextualizes genetic associations beyond single-gene analyses but also uncovers potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing, thereby offering a powerful tool for functional genomics and precision medicine.">[PASS] (1.00) Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct associations within trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene approaches may overlook. This novel framework offers a unique perspective for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>
