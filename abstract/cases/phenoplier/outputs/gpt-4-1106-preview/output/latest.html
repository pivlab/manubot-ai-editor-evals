Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of genes that exhibit coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method shows proficiency in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet playing functional roles are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.

In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is pivotal for advancing disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the intricate web of gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease manifestation remains less explored. This gap hinders the development of new therapies that could benefit from a more comprehensive view of gene function. Addressing this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to bridge genetic studies and pharmacological data, offering a unified analysis of gene-trait associations. PhenoPLIER constructs a latent space representation based on co-expression modules, enabling the identification of disease associations with gene clusters active in relevant cell types. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates drug mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally significant genes that traditional single-gene analyses often overlook. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER enhances our ability to interpret genetic associations by considering the collective behavior of gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing. This approach represents a significant stride in clustering complex traits, with broad implications for functional genomics and the development of precision medicine.

In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between genes and their collective influence on complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease development remains underexplored. This gap hinders the advancement of novel treatments and drug repurposing strategies. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a unified latent space, facilitating the simultaneous analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations. Our method employs co-expression modules to capture the concerted action of genes across various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic underpinnings of diseases by contextualizing genetic associations within gene modules, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach holds promise for enhancing drug discovery and repurposing by providing a more comprehensive view of gene function and interaction in complex traits.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.

PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that disease states are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The method demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are functionally significant.

In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. This framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic data through the prism of gene modules, providing insights into disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait correlations with pharmacological perturbation data within a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes collaborate within specific biological contexts to execute their functions, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of complex diseases.

PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules active in pertinent cell types. The accuracy of PhenoPLIER is demonstrated by its successful prediction of established drug-disease relationships and its ability to deduce mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation identified key functional genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends traditional single-gene approaches by integrating clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby providing a more comprehensive context for genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked.

Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to execute their functions. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene modules that are expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based screening focused on lipid regulation, we discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with traits, are nevertheless highlighted within trait-associated modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to provide context to genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations via gene expression patterns, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug discovery and repurposing efforts.

In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for unveiling disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. However, current genetic studies often overlook the collective influence of co-expressed gene clusters, thereby missing key insights into disease mechanisms and potential drug interventions. Addressing this gap, our research leverages a novel analytical framework, PhenoPLIER, to elucidate the relationship between gene modules and complex traits within relevant cellular contexts. Here we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers their mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employ a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PhenoPLIER successfully contextualizes genetic associations by focusing on gene expression patterns, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene approaches may overlook. This advancement in functional genomics not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of clustering of complex traits.

In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in the development and progression of diseases remains underexplored. This gap hinders the advancement of new treatment strategies, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach to capture the multifaceted nature of gene regulation. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational method that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data within a unified latent space, facilitating the simultaneous analysis of gene co-expression modules. Our findings reveal that diseases correlate significantly with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.
