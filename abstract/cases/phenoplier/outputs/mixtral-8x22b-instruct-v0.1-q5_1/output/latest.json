Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, with our approach demonstrating accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important contributors lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies."

Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, which is pivotal for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally critical players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating cohorts of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies."

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel method offers a more comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, ultimately moving the broader field forward by providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic development."

Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We observe that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By encompassing clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies."

          "output": "In the realm of genetics, understanding how specific genes interact with each other to influence complex traits is paramount for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. This manuscript aims to fill the gap in understanding these intricate relationships by introducing a novel computational approach: PhenoPLIER. The method maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This research not only advances our understanding of gene interactions but also highlights the broader significance of considering these relationships in disease treatment and progression."

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. This paper aims to fill the gap in our current knowledge by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed for joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. Our method maps these associations into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel method not only enhances our mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions but also paves the way for more targeted therapeutic interventions in the future."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": "In the pursuit of understanding the underlying mechanisms of complex traits and diseases, it is essential to consider not just individual genes but also their collective interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of single genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This is evident from our analysis using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, this work underscores the importance of considering gene expression patterns and interactions for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles, the current state of research underscores the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease development and progression.

We observe substantial associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, validating our method's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant components lack genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIEr.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions effectively. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture emphasize that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease onset and progression. We observe a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we find that functionally crucial components lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Herein, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and expose potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies."

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive insight into the regulation of expression across various conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease etiology and progression. We observe a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally critical components lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can elucidate the context of genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies."

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Our findings reveal a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER, our computational approach, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation identified functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach holds promise for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the projection of genetic associations via gene expression patterns."

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, there remains a significant gap in our knowledge regarding gene-gene interactions, which are predicted to play a vital role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "The intricate interplay between genes is instrumental in their functioning and impact on complex traits. A comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for the development of novel therapies, as it has been demonstrated that this insight plays a pivotal role in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on these aspects, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression – an area where current literature remains deficient. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By integrating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the importance of considering gene interactions in complex traits and emphasizes the potential of our approach to uncover new therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action."

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          "output": "In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each other is crucial for deciphering their roles in complex traits and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding the intricate interplay between multiple genes, which is predicted to significantly impact disease development and progression. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for contextualization of genetic associations and identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate our approach using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players, despite lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only enhance our understanding of gene interactions but also pave the way for developing more effective therapies and strategies targeting complex diseases."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, highlighting its potential to uncover targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing or development. This work advances the functional genomics field by providing a method that clusters complex traits and highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms through gene expression patterns.",

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach moves the broader field forward by providing a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions and their role in complex traits, ultimately leading to improved therapeutic interventions.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This work underscores the importance of considering gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for more effective therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing strategies.",

Elucidating how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We observe that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By encompassing clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. This paper aims to fill the gap in our current knowledge by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed for joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. Our method maps these associations into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel method not only enhances our mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions but also paves the way for more targeted therapeutic interventions in the future.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our approach highlights the importance of considering gene interactions for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a valuable tool for functional genomics studies and therapeutic target identification.",

However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to study these intricate relationships. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize gene-trait associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating PhenoPLIER's ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This underscores the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes for a better understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions and its impact on complex traits.\n\nIn conclusion, our study highlights the value of considering genetic associations through gene expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which is critical for developing new therapies. By contextualizing gene-trait associations using co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive approach that can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the broader field of functional genomics forward in understanding and treating complex diseases.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of single genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

This is evident from our analysis using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, this work underscores the importance of considering gene expression patterns and interactions for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, this method can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as evidenced by PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach provides a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, filling the gap left by current models and advancing genetic research towards more effective therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach highlights the broader significance of understanding gene expression patterns for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for therapy development.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, this method allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach provides valuable insights into the mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This work highlights the importance of considering gene interactions in complex traits and offers a novel method for identifying potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. However, there is a gap in understanding these complex interactions and how they can inform therapeutic strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill this void by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This method not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology but also opens avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of how these interactions impact trait regulation across different conditions. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our methodology has shown significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of gene regulation and disease mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is vital for developing new therapies, as it uncovers the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on this matter, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we observe a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. To explore these complex relationships further, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating such gene modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as demonstrated in a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, where functionally important players are prioritized within trait-associated modules despite lacking associations. PhenoPLIER's potential to uncover novel targets for drug repurposing and cluster complex traits highlights its broader significance in advancing functional genomics research and therapeutic development.",

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene interactions in complex traits research and provide a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug discovery.",

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies, as demonstrated by transcriptome-wide association studies that have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",

This insight is not only essential for comprehending the fundamental mechanisms of gene expression regulation across different conditions but also plays a pivotal role in developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This method not only addresses the gap in understanding gene interactions but also paves the way for more comprehensive and targeted therapeutic strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains largely unexplored. This gap in knowledge is significant as modern models suggest that these interactions play a critical part in disease origin and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework for joint analysis. Our method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the importance of considering gene interactions in disease etiology and drug discovery, highlighting the broader significance of our approach in advancing functional genomics and therapeutic target identification.",

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
