Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, with our approach demonstrating accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important contributors lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions. Elucidating how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We observe that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By encompassing clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in understanding the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to study these intricate relationships. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize gene-trait associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This underscores the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes for a better understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions and its impact on complex traits.

In conclusion, our study highlights the value of considering genetic associations through gene expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which is critical for developing new therapies. By contextualizing gene-trait associations using co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive approach that can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the broader field of functional genomics forward in understanding and treating complex diseases.

Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates genetic association data and pharmacological perturbation information into a shared latent representation for collective analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We observe that diseases demonstrate significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach proves to be precise in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally vital participants lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene tactics. Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to unraveling the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and expose potential targets overlooked by single-gene tactics. Genes operate in unison with each other within specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play an indispensable role in disease onset and progression.

In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding how groups of co-expressed genes influence complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, current approaches often overlook gene-gene interactions that are critical in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This is achieved through the use of modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as evidenced by PhenoPLIER&#39;s accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is not only critical for developing new therapies but also paves the way for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

Here we present PhenoPLIEr, a computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIEr. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering gene expression patterns and co-expression networks for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, with potential implications for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

Genes interact in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive insight into the regulation of expression across various conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease etiology and progression. We observe a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally critical components lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene interactions in complex traits research and provide a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug discovery.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
