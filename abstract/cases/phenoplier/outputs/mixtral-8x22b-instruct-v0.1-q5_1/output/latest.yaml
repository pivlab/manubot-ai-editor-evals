          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry out
          their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions, which is vital for the development of novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the
          discovery of individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. We observe significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types,
          with our approach demonstrating accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally important contributors lack associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide
          context to genetic associations and unveil potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding how multiple genes
          interact to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease origin and progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring
          mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important players lacking associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing
          lipid regulation, highlighting its potential to uncover targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
          potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing or development.
          This work advances the functional genomics field by providing a method
          that clusters complex traits and highlights disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms through gene expression patterns.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute
          their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions, which is pivotal for developing novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the
          same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally critical players lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating cohorts of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can provide context for genetic associations and unveil potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with

          our understanding of disease etiology but also holds promise for drug
          repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to
          execute their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
          traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in unveiling the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under the
          same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          we find that functionally important players may lack individual
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          with each other to influence complex traits is a critical yet
          challenging endeavor. This knowledge gap is particularly relevant for
          developing new therapies, as modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
          progression. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, they
          often overlook the intricate interplay between multiple genes. In this
          study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
          approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This work underscores the
          importance of considering gene interactions in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms, paving the way for more effective therapeutic target
          identification and drug repurposing strategies.

          Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute
          their functions. Elucidating how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions play a significant
          role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. We observe that diseases significantly
          correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to
          investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally
          significant players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By encompassing clusters of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic
          associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover
          that functionally important players lack associations but are

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a significant challenge.
          This mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions is not only crucial for advancing our knowledge
          but also critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing
          the intricate gene-gene interactions that play a pivotal role in
          disease origin and progression. In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER,
          a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach

          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

          of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how multiple genes interact to
          influence complex traits is crucial for developing effective
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease origin and progression. This paper aims to fill the gap in our
          current knowledge by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          designed for joint analysis of gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data. Our method maps these associations
          into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across various conditions. We found that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of our approach in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
          approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel method not
          only enhances our mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions but also paves the way for more targeted
          therapeutic interventions in the future.

          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Genes operate in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their functions; determining how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease etiology and progression.

          In recent years, transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology
          and progression. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across

          valuable tool for functional genomics studies and therapeutic target

          The intricate interplay between groups of co-expressed genes is
          crucial for understanding the molecular basis of complex traits and
          diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
          understanding the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies. However,
          modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression,
          necessitating a more comprehensive approach to study these intricate
          relationships. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          designed to fill this gap by mapping genetic associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
          us to contextualize gene-trait associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating
          PhenoPLIER's ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs
          and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players
          lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This underscores the importance of incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes for a better understanding of gene expression
          regulation across different conditions and its impact on complex
          traits.


          In conclusion, our study highlights the value of considering genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns to uncover disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, which is critical for developing new
          therapies. By contextualizing gene-trait associations using
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive approach
          that can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, ultimately moving the broader field of functional genomics
          forward in understanding and treating complex diseases.

          In the field of genetic research, understanding how groups of

          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates genetic association data and pharmacological perturbation
          information into a shared latent representation for collective
          analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          observe that diseases demonstrate significant associations with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach proves to
          be precise in predicting established drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR
          screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally
          vital participants lack direct associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic
          associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          tactics. Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to
          execute their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across various conditions, which is pivotal for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have contributed to unraveling the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
          architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the pursuit of understanding the underlying mechanisms of complex
          traits and diseases, it is essential to consider not just individual
          genes but also their collective interactions. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of single genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to address
          this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting PhenoPLIER's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. This is evident from our analysis using a CRISPR screen to
          study lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking
          direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, this work underscores the importance of
          considering gene expression patterns and interactions for uncovering
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the
          broader field of functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery.

          In the realm of genetic research, understanding how groups of
          co-expressed genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease origin and progression. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, this method can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, as evidenced by PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known

          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, our approach provides a mechanistic understanding
          of expression regulation across different conditions, filling the gap
          left by current models and advancing genetic research towards more
          effective therapies.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The understanding of how genes interact with each other to influence
          complex traits is critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach
          highlights the broader significance of understanding gene expression
          patterns for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, offering new
          avenues for therapy development.

          The intricate interplay between genes and their expression patterns is
          fundamental to understanding complex biological processes and
          diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on individual genes' roles, the current state of research underscores
          the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease development and
          progression. However, a significant gap remains in integrating genetic
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data to contextualize
          these complex relationships better. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that addresses this challenge by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This novel methodology not only
          advances our understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions but also holds promise for developing new therapies that
          consider the complex interactions between genes in specific contexts.

          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for collective analysis. This
          representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting analogous
          expression patterns across identical conditions. We observe that
          diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types, and our approach demonstrates precision in
          predicting recognized drug-disease pairs and deducing mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to scrutinize lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally significant actors lack
          associations but are given priority in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and expose
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene tactics. Genes operate in
          unison with each other within specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions, which is crucial for the development of
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in
          revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play an indispensable role in
          disease onset and progression.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the realm of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how groups of co-expressed genes influence complex traits is pivotal
          for elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets. However, current approaches often overlook gene-gene
          interactions that are critical in disease origin and progression. Here
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to fill
          this gap by mapping genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This is achieved through the use of modules consisting of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as evidenced by
          PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analysis
          on lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players
          lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
          approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is
          not only critical for developing new therapies but also paves the way
          for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          In the field of genetic research, understanding how groups of genes
          influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role
          of individual genes, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a significant role in disease origin and progression. This
          manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to
          map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
          a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          this method allows for the contextualization of genetic associations
          and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          found that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach provides
          valuable insights into the mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. This work highlights the
          importance of considering gene interactions in complex traits and
          offers a novel method for identifying potential therapeutic targets
          that may have been overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies.

          Genes often collaborate in a coordinated manner to execute their
          functions within specific contexts. A comprehensive understanding of
          how these genes impact complex traits necessitates an exploration into
          the mechanisms governing expression regulation across diverse
          conditions, which is essential for advancing novel therapeutic
          approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant pathways; however,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology
          and progression. We observe substantial associations between diseases
          and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, validating our
          method's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen
          examining lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          significant components lack genetic associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIEr. In this study, we

          integrates gene-trait association data and pharmacological
          perturbation information into a unified latent representation for

          exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating cohorts of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIEr can provide
          context to genetic associations and disclose potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the pursuit of understanding complex traits, it is crucial to
          unravel how genes interact with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. However, there is a
          gap in understanding these complex interactions and how they can
          inform therapeutic strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach designed to fill this void by mapping genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This method not only enhances our understanding of disease
          etiology but also opens avenues for drug repurposing and the
          identification of novel therapeutic targets.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact to perform
          their functions is crucial for determining their influence on complex
          traits. This insight is not only valuable but also critical for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant
          role in disease origin and progression. However, there remains a gap
          in understanding how these interactions contribute to complex traits
          and diseases. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our method has
          proven accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, as diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our
          approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This is evidenced by a
          CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation, where functionally
          important players lacked associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. The broader significance of
          this work lies in its potential to advance our understanding of
          complex traits and diseases, ultimately contributing to the
          development of more effective therapies.

          Genes often collaborate in specific contexts to execute their
          functions effectively. Understanding how these genes impact complex
          traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
          etiology and progression. We observe significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their
          respective mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players may lack individual genetic associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this
          paper, we present PhenoPLIEER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on clusters of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIEER can contextualize genetic associations
          and unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with
          each other to influence complex traits is a significant challenge.
          This mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions is not only crucial for gaining insights into
          disease etiology but also critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
          progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that
          might be missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This method not only
          bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics but
          also has broader significance in identifying therapeutic targets and
          repurposing drugs through clustering of complex traits.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact to perform
          their functions is crucial for deciphering complex traits. This
          knowledge gap is particularly significant in disease mechanisms, where
          insights into expression regulation can pave the way for new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed

          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, allowing it to contextualize genetic associations and

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions
          effectively. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development
          of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture emphasize that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease onset and progression. We observe a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types. Our approach accurately predicts established drug-disease
          pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we find that
          functionally crucial components lack associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Herein, we present
          PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
          expose potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          with each other to influence complex traits is crucial for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, there
          remains a gap in our knowledge regarding gene-gene interactions and
          their impact on disease etiology and progression. Here we present
          PhenoPLIEr, a computational approach that addresses this gap by
          mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the
          contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIEr. Overall, this
          work highlights the importance of considering gene expression patterns
          and co-expression networks for understanding disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, with potential implications for therapeutic target
          discovery and drug repurposing.

          Genes interact in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to
          complex traits necessitates a comprehensive insight into the
          regulation of expression across various conditions, which is essential
          for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          influence disease etiology and progression. We observe a significant
          correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent
          cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing
          a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally critical components lack associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating
          clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can elucidate the context
          of genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies.

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The intricate interplay between genes in specific contexts is crucial
          for executing their functions and influencing complex traits. A
          comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions is vital for developing new therapies, as it uncovers the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Although
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on this matter,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
          observe a significant association between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. To explore these complex
          relationships further, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on groups of co-expressed genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating such gene modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as demonstrated in
          a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, where functionally
          important players are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          despite lacking associations. PhenoPLIER's potential to uncover novel
          targets for drug repurposing and cluster complex traits highlights its
          broader significance in advancing functional genomics research and
          therapeutic development.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin
          and progression. This paper addresses a gap in the current literature
          by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, this method
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work not only advances
          our understanding of gene interactions' role in complex traits but
          also paves the way for more effective therapeutic strategies.

          Genes often work in concert to carry out their functions within
          specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease etiology and progression. Our findings reveal a significant
          association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. PhenoPLIER, our computational approach, accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by
          mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on clusters of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By integrating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation identified
          functionally important players that lack individual associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
          approach holds promise for understanding disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms through the projection of genetic associations via gene
          expression patterns.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how genes interact with each other to influence complex traits is a
          critical challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease etiology and progression. However, the current literature
          lacks a comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic associations
          within these complex networks of interaction. In this paper, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that addresses this gap
          by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players, lacking associations, were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This method not only enhances our understanding
          of disease etiology but also opens avenues for drug repurposing and
          clustering of complex traits, thereby moving the broader field
          forward.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the pursuit of understanding complex traits and their underlying
          genetic influences, it is crucial to decipher how genes interact with
          each other across various conditions. This mechanistic comprehension
          has proven essential for developing new therapeutic strategies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
          progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential of our approach for
          identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs
          based on functional genomics insights, ultimately moving the broader
          field forward in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for their functioning
          and influences complex traits, making it essential to understand the
          mechanisms of expression regulation across various conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene roles in disease-relevant processes, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          aimed at jointly analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data through a shared latent representation. This
          representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under the same conditions, enabling
          contextualization of genetic associations and uncovering potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate
          that diseases significantly associate with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation revealed that
          functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by our method. Overall, this study
          highlights the significance of gene co-expression patterns in
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for
          improved therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing
          strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for understanding
          complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes,
          there remains a significant gap in our knowledge regarding gene-gene
          interactions, which are predicted to play a vital role in disease
          origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

          advancing drug discovery and therapeutic strategies.

          Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry
          out their functions. Elucidating how these genes contribute to complex
          traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions, which is vital for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions significantly

          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
          unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene tactics. Our
          findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the importance of considering gene
          co-expression patterns for understanding disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, paving the way for more effective therapeutic target
          identification and drug repurposing strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other to influence complex traits is a critical challenge. This
          insight is not only essential for comprehending the fundamental
          mechanisms of gene expression regulation across different conditions
          but also plays a pivotal role in developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin
          and progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This method not only
          addresses the gap in understanding gene interactions but also paves
          the way for more comprehensive and targeted therapeutic strategies.

          Genes often work collaboratively within specific contexts to execute
          their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex
          traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies

          The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for understanding
          complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual gene functions, the
          role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains largely
          unexplored. This gap in knowledge is significant as modern models
          suggest that these interactions play a critical part in disease origin
          and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework for joint

          interactions in disease etiology and drug discovery, highlighting the

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The intricate interplay between genes is instrumental in their
          functioning and impact on complex traits. A comprehensive
          understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions
          is crucial for the development of novel therapies, as it has been
          demonstrated that this insight plays a pivotal role in uncovering
          individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on these
          aspects, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to disease origin and progression â€“ an area
          where current literature remains deficient. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. By integrating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our findings
          reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important players lacking associations
          were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
          study underscores the importance of considering gene interactions in
          complex traits and emphasizes the potential of our approach to uncover
          new therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action.

          In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact with

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other is crucial for deciphering their roles in complex traits and
          diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
          on individual gene functions, there remains a gap in our knowledge
          regarding the intricate interplay between multiple genes, which is
          predicted to significantly impact disease development and progression.
          To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for
          contextualization of genetic associations and identification of
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we validate our approach using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players,
          despite lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only enhance our
          understanding of gene interactions but also pave the way for
          developing more effective therapies and strategies targeting complex
          diseases.

              Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry
              out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
              traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions, which is vital for the
              development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, with our
              approach demonstrating accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a
              CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important contributors lack associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              provide context to genetic associations and unveil potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring

              important players lacking associations in a CRISPR screen
              analyzing lipid regulation, highlighting its potential to uncover
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic
              associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets for drug
              repurposing or development. This work advances the functional
              genomics field by providing a method that clusters complex traits

              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other in specific contexts to perform their functions is
              crucial for determining their influence on complex traits. This
              insight is not only fundamental but also critical for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

              Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute
              their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
              traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions, which is pivotal for
              developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions

              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes

              We observe significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
              we discover that functionally critical players lack associations
              but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              By incorporating cohorts of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              provide context for genetic associations and unveil potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here
              we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players
              lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              approach not only advances our understanding of disease etiology
              but also holds promise for drug repurposing and the identification
              of novel therapeutic targets.

              Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to
              execute their functions. Understanding how these genes impact
              complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial

              association studies have been instrumental in unveiling the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease

              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact with each other to influence complex traits is a critical
              yet challenging endeavor. This knowledge gap is particularly

              that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. Although transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, they often overlook the intricate interplay between
              multiple genes. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we found
              that functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This work underscores the
              importance of considering gene interactions in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms, paving the way for more effective therapeutic
              target identification and drug repurposing strategies.

              Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute
              their functions. Elucidating how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
              the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how specific genes
              interact with each other to influence complex traits is paramount
              for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. This
              manuscript aims to fill the gap in understanding these intricate
              relationships by introducing a novel computational approach:
              PhenoPLIER. The method maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. A CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This research not only
              advances our understanding of gene interactions but also
              highlights the broader significance of considering these
              relationships in disease treatment and progression.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert to perform their functions within
              specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions, which is vital for the
              development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association

              of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
              regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how multiple genes
              interact to influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on individual gene functions in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. This
              paper aims to fill the gap in our current knowledge by introducing
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed for joint analysis
              of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data.
              Our method maps these associations into a common latent
              representation based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across various conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, validating the accuracy of our approach in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation,
              we discovered that functionally important players lacking
              associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
              approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel
              method not only enhances our mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions but also paves

              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates genetic association data and pharmacological
              perturbation profiles into a unified latent representation for

              The intricate interplay between groups of co-expressed genes is
              crucial for understanding the molecular basis of complex traits
              and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

            Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
            of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific
            contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
            influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
            expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
            that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
            Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role
            of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
            models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
            interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

              The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
              understanding the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies.
              However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to study
              these intricate relationships. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach designed to fill this gap by mapping
              genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
              common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
              contextualize gene-trait associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              validating PhenoPLIER's ability to accurately predict known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              underscores the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes for a better understanding of gene expression regulation
              across different conditions and its impact on complex traits.


              In conclusion, our study highlights the value of considering
              genetic associations through gene expression patterns to uncover
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which is critical for
              developing new therapies. By contextualizing gene-trait
              associations using co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more
              comprehensive approach that can reveal potential therapeutic
              targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the
              broader field of functional genomics forward in understanding and
              treating complex diseases.

              In the field of genetic research, understanding how groups of
              co-expressed genes influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association

              collective analysis. This representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We observe that diseases demonstrate significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types,
              and our approach proves to be precise in predicting established
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              by employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we
              discover that functionally vital participants lack direct
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and unveil
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene tactics. Genes
              collaborate with each other in specific contexts to execute their
              functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across various conditions, which is pivotal for the development of
              novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              contributed to unraveling the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.

              In the pursuit of understanding the underlying mechanisms of
              complex traits and diseases, it is essential to consider not just
              individual genes but also their collective interactions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of single genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
              disease etiology. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach designed to address this gap by mapping genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              under the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, highlighting PhenoPLIER's accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              This is evident from our analysis using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking
              direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, this work underscores the importance of
              considering gene expression patterns and interactions for
              uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby
              contributing to the broader field of functional genomics and
              therapeutic target discovery.

              In the realm of genetic research, understanding how groups of

              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association

              The understanding of how genes interact with each other to
              influence complex traits is critical for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked
              associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach highlights the broader significance of understanding
              gene expression patterns for disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
              offering new avenues for therapy development.

              The intricate interplay between genes and their expression
              patterns is fundamental to understanding complex biological
              processes and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual genes' roles, the current
              state of research underscores the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease development and progression. However, a
              significant gap remains in integrating genetic associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data to contextualize these complex
              relationships better. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that addresses this challenge by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This novel methodology not only
              advances our understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions but also holds promise for developing new
              therapies that consider the complex interactions between genes in
              specific contexts.

              Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for
              collective analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of
              genes exhibiting analogous expression patterns across identical
              conditions. We observe that diseases significantly correlate with
              gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach
              demonstrates precision in predicting recognized drug-disease pairs
              and deducing mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a CRISPR
              screen to scrutinize lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally significant actors lack associations but are given
              priority in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              provide context for genetic associations and expose potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene tactics. Genes operate in unison
              with each other within specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across diverse conditions, which is crucial for the development of
              novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided
              in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
              complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play an

              In the field of genetic research, understanding how groups of
              genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
              and progression. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, this
              method allows for the contextualization of genetic associations
              and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
              approach provides valuable insights into the mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This work highlights the importance of considering
              gene interactions in complex traits and offers a novel method for
              identifying potential therapeutic targets that may have been
              overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies.

              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              Genes often collaborate in a coordinated manner to execute their
              functions within specific contexts. A comprehensive understanding
              of how these genes impact complex traits necessitates an
              exploration into the mechanisms governing expression regulation
              across diverse conditions, which is essential for advancing novel
              therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant pathways; however, contemporary models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. We
              observe substantial associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in pertinent cell types, validating our method's
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen
              examining lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              significant components lack genetic associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIEr. In this
              study, we present PhenoPLIEr, an innovative computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait association data and pharmacological
              perturbation information into a unified latent representation for
              joint analysis. This representation is based on clusters of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              By incorporating cohorts of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIEr can
              provide context to genetic associations and disclose potential

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              perform their functions is crucial for determining their influence
              on complex traits. This insight is not only valuable but also
              critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
              progression. However, there remains a gap in understanding how
              these interactions contribute to complex traits and diseases. Here
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our method has
              proven accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action, as diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, our approach can contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This is evidenced by a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation,
              where functionally important players lacked associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. The broader
              significance of this work lies in its potential to advance our
              understanding of complex traits and diseases, ultimately
              contributing to the development of more effective therapies.

              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section

              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel

              Genes often collaborate in specific contexts to execute their
              functions effectively. Understanding how these genes impact
              complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital
              for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. We
              observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers their respective mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players may lack
              individual genetic associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this paper, we present
              PhenoPLIEER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIEER can contextualize genetic associations and
              unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              perform their functions is crucial for deciphering complex traits.
              This knowledge gap is particularly significant in disease
              mechanisms, where insights into expression regulation can pave the
              way for new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association

              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions
              effectively. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for
              the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture emphasize that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease onset and progression. We
              observe a significant correlation between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates their
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation analysis, we find that functionally crucial
              components lack associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Herein, we present
              PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and expose
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact with each other to influence complex traits is crucial
              for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding
              gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease etiology and
              progression. Here we present PhenoPLIEr, a computational approach
              that addresses this gap by mapping genetic associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, allowing for the contextualization of genetic
              associations and the identification of potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are

              this work highlights the importance of considering gene expression
              patterns and co-expression networks for understanding disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, with potential implications for
              therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

              Genes interact in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes
              contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive insight
              into the regulation of expression across various conditions, which
              is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions significantly influence disease etiology and
              progression. We observe a significant correlation between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing a CRISPR screen to
              examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally critical
              components lack associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across identical conditions. By incorporating
              clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can elucidate the
              context of genetic associations and unveil potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              The intricate interplay between genes in specific contexts is
              crucial for executing their functions and influencing complex
              traits. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions is vital for developing new therapies,
              as it uncovers the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on this matter, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
              progression. In this study, we observe a significant association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. To explore these complex relationships further, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating such gene
              modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              unveil potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as demonstrated in a CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation, where functionally important
              players are prioritized within trait-associated modules despite
              lacking associations. PhenoPLIER's potential to uncover novel
              targets for drug repurposing and cluster complex traits highlights
              its broader significance in advancing functional genomics research
              and therapeutic development.

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact to
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.

              suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how genes interact with each other to influence
              complex traits is a critical challenge. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
              disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
              progression. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive
              approach to contextualize genetic associations within these
              complex networks of interaction. In this paper, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that addresses this gap by
              mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players, lacking
              associations, were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This method not only enhances our understanding of
              disease etiology but also opens avenues for drug repurposing and
              clustering of complex traits, thereby moving the broader field
              forward.

              Genes often collaborate with each other in specific contexts to
              carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions, which is
              essential for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide

              In the pursuit of understanding complex traits and their
              underlying genetic influences, it is crucial to decipher how genes
              interact with each other across various conditions. This
              mechanistic comprehension has proven essential for developing new
              therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association

              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions

              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar

              In the study of complex traits, understanding how genes interact
              with each other is crucial for determining their influence and
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual gene functions in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of
              considering gene interactions in complex traits research and
              provide a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of disease
              mechanisms and drug discovery.

              Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry
              out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is
              crucial for the development of new therapies, as demonstrated by
              transcriptome-wide association studies that have uncovered the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease
              etiology and progression. In this paper, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we discover that functionally significant players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for their
              functioning and influences complex traits, making it essential to
              understand the mechanisms of expression regulation across various
              conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant processes,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly

              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach aimed at jointly

              data through a shared latent representation. This representation
              is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns under the same conditions, enabling contextualization of
              genetic associations and uncovering potential targets overlooked
              by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases
              significantly associate with gene modules expressed in relevant

              functionally important players lacking associations were

              The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for understanding
              complex traits and developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, there remains a significant gap in our
              knowledge regarding gene-gene interactions, which are predicted to
              play a vital role in disease origin and progression. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              important players lacking associations were prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study's findings not
              only contribute to our understanding of complex traits but also
              have broader significance in advancing drug discovery and
              therapeutic strategies.

              Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to
              carry out their functions. Elucidating how these genes contribute
              to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is vital
              for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene
              interactions significantly influence disease etiology and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded
              on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene tactics. Our
              findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a significant

              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role

              This insight is not only essential for comprehending the
              fundamental mechanisms of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions but also plays a pivotal role in developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. Here
              we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to
              map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. Our findings reveal that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered
              that functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This method
              not only addresses the gap in understanding gene interactions but
              also paves the way for more comprehensive and targeted therapeutic
              strategies.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes often work collaboratively within specific contexts to
              execute their functions. Understanding how these genes contribute
              to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions, which is vital
              for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our
              findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach
              demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR
              screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that functionally
              significant players lack associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The intricate interplay between genes is crucial for understanding

              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact
              with each other to influence complex traits is a significant
              challenge. The mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions is not only crucial for uncovering
              disease-relevant mechanisms but also critical for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the role of individual genes, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              designed to fill this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated

              In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              each other is crucial for deciphering their roles in complex
              traits and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on individual gene functions, there remains a gap
              in our knowledge regarding the intricate interplay between
              multiple genes, which is predicted to significantly impact disease
              development and progression. To bridge this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This

              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for
