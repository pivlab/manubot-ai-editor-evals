Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that might have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of expression across various conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the nuanced relationships between genes that contribute to disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its ability to reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, emerging models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This integration is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital in developing innovative therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, and we find that diseases are markedly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is proficient in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER elucidates genetic associations' context, revealing potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, facilitating joint analysis. Genes function as part of complex networks, exerting their effects in specific contexts through intricate regulation of expression across various conditions. This mechanistic understanding is critical for elucidating the role of gene-gene interactions in the etiology and progression of complex traits, thereby paving the way for therapeutic advancements. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, the intricate interplay among these genes remains largely unexplored. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across analogous conditions, PhenoPLIER demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The method exhibits robust performance in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, devoid of individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules represents a valuable resource for functional genomics research, drug repurposing, and therapeutic target identification.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " The study of genetic associations with complex traits and diseases has traditionally focused on individual genes, but recent research suggests that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual gene associations in genetic screens. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This work highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to better understand complex traits and diseases, with implications for drug development and repurposing."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes function in coordination with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This insight is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is predicated on gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, through the analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we discovered that functionally critical elements lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in the context of complex networks, where they collaborate with other genes to execute specific roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits and disease etiology, which is critical for developing effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern genetic studies suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact trait architecture, contributing to both disease origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER employs a representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules, highlighting the importance of understanding the functional context of gene expression in specific cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, showcasing its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.\n\nApplying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen aimed at analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes, which might otherwise be overlooked due to lack of individual gene-trait associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of functional genomics and reveals potential targets that may be missed by conventional single-gene strategies.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a major gap exists in our understanding of how gene-gene interactions contribute to complex traits and disease etiology. Current transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they fail to capture the intricate interplay among genes that is critical for a comprehensive view of disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and furthermore, it reveals functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for identifying novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, ultimately advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes often function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER represents genes based on modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for improved drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The study of genetic associations and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms is a crucial area of research, yet the current methods primarily focus on individual genes rather than gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to determine how these genes influence complex traits through their mechanistic understanding of expression regulation. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach moves the broader field forward by highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, as well as drug mechanisms, thereby addressing the current gap in the literature."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The role of genes in the regulation of complex traits and their potential as therapeutic targets is well-established. However, understanding how these genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts remains an open research question. Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Crucially, we find that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, as exemplified by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms, our work underscores the broader significance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to reveal novel therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Here, we introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and insights into mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, our method highlights potential targets overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies, thereby providing a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, identifying how genes contribute to complex traits remains a significant challenge. A crucial aspect of this challenge is understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing effective therapies, as it provides insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach that integrates genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to address this challenge. Our method involves clustering complex traits based on the functional genomics of genes expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer their mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER, a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing genetic associations in this way, we can reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the broader field forward."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, identifying how genes influence complex traits remains a significant challenge. A crucial aspect of this challenge is understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This mechanistic understanding is critical for elucidating disease etiology and developing effective therapies. In this study, we employed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating functional genomics and gene co-expression analyses, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive methods to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we found that diseases are significantly associated with these modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a valuable tool for functional genomics research, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is essential for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach relies on gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions as the basis of its representation. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies functionally important players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying critical players that might have been otherwise overlooked."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This method is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing us to uncover significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, our approach identifies functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions in complex traits, this study highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER for drug repurposing and uncovering novel therapeutic targets."

This insight is particularly vital in developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This knowledge is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking individual associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis.

Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions. Such knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " The development of effective therapies relies on a comprehensive understanding of how genes contribute to complex traits. Current approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have been successful in identifying individual gene-trait associations but often overlook the critical role of gene-gene interactions. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, which allows for the examination of disease-gene module associations in relevant cell types. Our findings indicate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking individual trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method. This study not only highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits but also provides a valuable tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: {{ paragraph }}\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that might have been overlooked using single-gene strategies.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and advancing the field of functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "Expected output to contain \"CRISPR\"\n---\n In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits is critical yet remains elusive. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions (context). Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, while prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations in trait-associated modules. Our results suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations, reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules (conclusion). This research therefore advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in complex traits by emphasizing the importance of gene-gene interactions.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of expression across various conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting new avenues for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its ability to reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, offering new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and paving the way for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital in developing innovative therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, and we find that diseases are markedly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is proficient in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER elucidates genetic associations' context, revealing potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that the architecture of complex traits is heavily influenced by gene co-expression patterns. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover functionally important players lacking individual gene associations that are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes function as part of complex networks, exerting their effects in specific contexts through intricate regulation of expression across various conditions. This mechanistic understanding is critical for elucidating the role of gene-gene interactions in the etiology and progression of complex traits, thereby paving the way for therapeutic advancements. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, the intricate interplay among these genes remains largely unexplored. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across analogous conditions, PhenoPLIER demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The method exhibits robust performance in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, devoid of individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules represents a valuable resource for functional genomics research, drug repurposing, and therapeutic target identification.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual gene associations in genetic screens. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This work highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to better understand complex traits and diseases, with implications for drug development and repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              "text": " The study of genetic associations is crucial for understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. However, traditional methods have primarily focused on individual genes, neglecting the complex interactions between them. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on the observation that genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics studies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes function in the context of complex networks, where they collaborate with other genes to execute specific roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits and disease etiology, which is critical for developing effective therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern genetic studies suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact trait architecture, contributing to both disease origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER employs a representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules, highlighting the importance of understanding the functional context of gene expression in specific cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, showcasing its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.\n\nApplying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen aimed at analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes, which might otherwise be overlooked due to lack of individual gene-trait associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of functional genomics and reveals potential targets that may be missed by conventional single-gene strategies.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

Current transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they fail to capture the intricate interplay among genes that is critical for a comprehensive view of disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and furthermore, it reveals functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for identifying novel therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, ultimately advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Genes often function in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER represents genes based on modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for improved drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to determine how these genes influence complex traits through their mechanistic understanding of expression regulation. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach moves the broader field forward by highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, as well as drug mechanisms, thereby addressing the current gap in the literature.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " The role of genes in the regulation of complex traits and their potential as therapeutic targets is well-established. However, understanding how these genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts remains an open research question. Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Crucially, we find that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, as exemplified by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms, our work underscores the broader significance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to reveal novel therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Here, we introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and insights into mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, our method highlights potential targets overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies, thereby providing a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing drug repurposing efforts.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A crucial aspect of this challenge is understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing effective therapies, as it provides insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach that integrates genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to address this challenge. Our method involves clustering complex traits based on the functional genomics of genes expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer their mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER, a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing genetic associations in this way, we can reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the broader field forward.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A crucial aspect of this challenge is understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This mechanistic understanding is critical for elucidating disease etiology and developing effective therapies. In this study, we employed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating functional genomics and gene co-expression analyses, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is essential for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach relies on gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions as the basis of its representation. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies functionally important players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " The study of how genes interact to influence complex traits and diseases is a crucial yet unresolved issue in genetics. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, they fail to capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results suggest that integrating gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data can provide novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the potential of PhenoPLIER for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This method is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing us to uncover significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, our approach identifies functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions in complex traits, this study highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER for drug repurposing and uncovering novel therapeutic targets.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This knowledge is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions that are believed to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking individual associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the potential of functional genomics approaches to reveal new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for more effective therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions that underlie many diseases. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations. Our findings highlight the potential of functional genomics approaches in uncovering new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a foundation for further exploration of gene co-expression patterns in complex trait clustering and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions. Such knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",

              "text": " The development of effective therapies relies on a comprehensive understanding of how genes contribute to complex traits. Current approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have been successful in identifying individual gene-trait associations but often overlook the critical role of gene-gene interactions. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, which allows for the examination of disease-gene module associations in relevant cell types. Our findings indicate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking individual trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method. This study not only highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits but also provides a valuable tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
