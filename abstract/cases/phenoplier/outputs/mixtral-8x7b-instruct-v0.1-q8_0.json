Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is crucial for developing effective therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked through single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules provides a promising avenue for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is critical for elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach offers a new lens through which to interpret genetic associations via gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits is critical yet remains elusive. Current methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations; however, they fail to account for the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, as evidenced by the prioritization of functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, shedding light on complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is critical for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression.\n\nIn this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nUsing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the gene-gene interactions that are increasingly recognized as crucial in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual gene associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the broader field of functional genomics forward."

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is crucial for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This integration is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This framework provides a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not fully capture the intricate network of gene-gene interactions that underlie disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex trait architecture, highlighting new avenues for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in functional genomics."

Genes function in the context of specific conditions by working in concert with other genes to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing effective therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene associations with disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we applied PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, revealing that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The study of genetic associations is crucial for understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. However, traditional methods have primarily focused on individual gene-trait associations, neglecting the complex interplay between genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing us to capture the collective influence of these genes on complex traits. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the broader significance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes for understanding disease mechanisms and drug action."

Genes function in the context of complex networks, executing their roles through intricate regulatory patterns across various conditions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation is essential to elucidate the influence of genes on complex traits, which is vital for developing effective therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-disease associations, modern genetic research suggests that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes, which may lack individual associations, are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene networks, PhenoPLIER provides new insights into genetic associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets that might be overlooked through conventional single-gene analysis strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, paving the way for improved drug repurposing and precision medicine.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is vital for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is essential for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits emphasize the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression.\n\nThe foundation of PhenoPLIER lies in the construction of gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important genes lacking individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's innovative approach, which incorporates co-expressed gene groups, enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. By offering a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, with potential implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent advances in the understanding of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER employs a representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations with disease-relevant mechanisms. However, emerging evidence suggests that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are part of trait-associated modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the broader significance of functional genomics in disease research and drug development."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes often function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to decipher how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for the development of new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's representation is built upon modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our method provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits and develop novel therapies. Our study reveals a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential to bridge this gap, as it can reveal novel therapeutic targets.

By clustering genes into functional modules and analyzing their expression in relevant cell types, we find significant associations between diseases and these gene modules. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " In specific contexts, genes function cooperatively to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is essential for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. Our study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation and discovered that functionally critical genes, which lack individual genetic associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations within the context of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This research contributes to functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts through clustering of complex traits in genetic studies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies and for repurposing existing drugs. In this study, we introduce a new approach, PhenoPLIER, which leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can highlight potential targets overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules not only provides insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also holds promise for advancing functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Existing methods primarily focus on individual gene associations, often overlooking critical functional relationships within gene networks. In this study, we introduce and validate PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant associations with diseases and accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs, as well as inferring mechanisms of action. Our approach also reveals functionally important players lacking individual associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression, contextualizing single-gene strategies and uncovering potential therapeutic targets in complex traits (Keywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits)."

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial to elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, and ultimately, for developing novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. To summarize, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that might have been overlooked through single-gene strategies. Our study establishes PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thus providing new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to influence these traits remains elusive. Here, we present a novel approach that integrates genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to reveal significant disease-gene module associations and highlight potential therapeutic targets. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by clustering complex traits based on their gene expression profiles. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, which revealed that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting genetic data and uncovering potential targets overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing."

This insight is vital in developing novel therapeutic strategies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they do not fully capture the complexity of gene interactions that are critical for developing new therapies. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs through the clustering of complex traits in functional genomics."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, an analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing the intricate network of gene-gene interactions that underlie disease mechanisms. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. By clustering genes based on their expression patterns across various conditions, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in advancing functional genomics, drug repurposing, and uncovering novel therapeutic targets for complex traits."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. By representing genes with similar expression patterns across conditions as modules, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations in trait-associated modules. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to improve our understanding of disease etiology, identify therapeutic targets, and repurpose drugs by clustering complex traits based on functional genomics data."

          "output": " Genes operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical to disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This method is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which allows for the examination of diseases in the context of relevant cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and furthermore, it prioritizes functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are present in trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER for facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities through a functional genomics lens, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of complex traits and developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Interestingly, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations can be prioritized as members of trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

          "output": " The interplay of genes in specific contexts to carry out their functions is crucial for understanding the influence of these genes on complex traits, particularly in the context of disease mechanisms and therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant processes, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding the impact of gene-gene interactions on disease origin and progression. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions to reveal significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct gene-trait associations. This research not only advances our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits but also highlights the potential for repurposing drugs by identifying novel therapeutic targets."

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is crucial for developing effective therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked through single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules provides a promising avenue for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach has implications for both drug repurposing and the identification of new therapeutic targets in functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is critical for elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Current methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations; however, they fail to account for the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, as evidenced by the prioritization of functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, shedding light on complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

              "text": " In the field of genetics, understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack individual genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in complex trait studies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the gene-gene interactions that are increasingly recognized as crucial in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual gene associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately moving the broader field of functional genomics forward.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "Expected output to contain \"CRISPR\"\n---\n In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not fully capture the intricate network of gene-gene interactions that underlie disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex trait architecture, highlighting new avenues for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in functional genomics.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, traditional methods have primarily focused on individual gene-trait associations, neglecting the complex interplay between genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing us to capture the collective influence of these genes on complex traits. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the broader significance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes for understanding disease mechanisms and drug action.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Genes function in the context of complex networks, executing their roles through intricate regulatory patterns across various conditions. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation is essential to elucidate the influence of genes on complex traits, which is vital for developing effective therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-disease associations, modern genetic research suggests that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes, which may lack individual associations, are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene networks, PhenoPLIER provides new insights into genetic associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets that might be overlooked through conventional single-gene analysis strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, paving the way for improved drug repurposing and precision medicine.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling us to uncover significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is vital for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is essential for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern perspectives on the architecture of complex traits emphasize the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression.\n\nThe foundation of PhenoPLIER lies in the construction of gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important genes lacking individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's innovative approach, which incorporates co-expressed gene groups, enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. By offering a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER holds promise for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, with potential implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",

This gap is critical as mechanistic insights into expression regulation are essential for developing novel therapies and repurposing existing drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method represents genes based on modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, particularly in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking individual gene associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and advancing functional genomics research in complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene associations with disease-relevant mechanisms. However, emerging evidence suggests that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing us to identify significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are part of trait-associated modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting the broader significance of functional genomics in disease research and drug development.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene co-expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players that lack individual gene associations. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER highlights potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential to bridge this gap, as it can reveal novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering genes into functional modules and analyzing their expression in relevant cell types, we find significant associations between diseases and these gene modules. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies and for repurposing existing drugs. In this study, we introduce a new approach, PhenoPLIER, which leverages gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can highlight potential targets overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules not only provides insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also holds promise for advancing functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Existing methods primarily focus on individual gene associations, often overlooking critical functional relationships within gene networks. In this study, we introduce and validate PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant associations with diseases and accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs, as well as inferring mechanisms of action. Our approach also reveals functionally important players lacking individual associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression, contextualizing single-gene strategies and uncovering potential therapeutic targets in complex traits (Keywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits).",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that addresses this gap by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By providing a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, our study moves the broader field forward towards a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and therapeutic targets.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to influence these traits remains elusive. Here, we present a novel approach that integrates genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to reveal significant disease-gene module associations and highlight potential therapeutic targets. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by clustering complex traits based on their gene expression profiles. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, which revealed that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting genetic data and uncovering potential targets overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they do not fully capture the complexity of gene interactions that are critical for developing new therapies. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs through the clustering of complex traits in functional genomics.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing the intricate network of gene-gene interactions that underlie disease mechanisms. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. By clustering genes based on their expression patterns across various conditions, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in advancing functional genomics, drug repurposing, and uncovering novel therapeutic targets for complex traits.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. By representing genes with similar expression patterns across conditions as modules, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations in trait-associated modules. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to improve our understanding of disease etiology, identify therapeutic targets, and repurpose drugs by clustering complex traits based on functional genomics data.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that are predicted to play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This method is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which allows for the examination of diseases in the context of relevant cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and furthermore, it prioritizes functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are present in trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER for facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities through a functional genomics lens, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. (Keywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.)",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of complex traits and developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Interestingly, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant genes lacking associations can be prioritized as members of trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant processes, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding the impact of gene-gene interactions on disease origin and progression. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions to reveal significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct gene-trait associations. This research not only advances our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits but also highlights the potential for repurposing drugs by identifying novel therapeutic targets.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
