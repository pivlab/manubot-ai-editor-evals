The concerted action of genes is essential for their functional performance in specific contexts. However, uncovering the complex interplay between these genes and disease-relevant mechanisms remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a computational approach called PhenoPLIER that links gene expression patterns, disease associations, and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on the concept of gene modules, which represent groups of genes with similar expression profiles across different conditions. By integrating this information, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We also demonstrate the value of our approach by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize complex traits and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating multiple data sources to gain a deeper understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[PASS] (1.00)

Context: Genetic studies have been instrumental in the discovery of disease-relevant mechanisms, but they often fail to capture the complex interplay between genes and their regulation across different conditions. Functional genomics has shed light on this problem by providing insights into gene expression patterns and their association with complex traits. However, current approaches are limited by a lack of understanding of how these patterns translate into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Content: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify key players in complex diseases. Our method maps genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions into modules, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.

Conclusion: By leveraging gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Our approach can help bridge the gap between functional genomics and disease etiology, leading to more effective drug discovery and personalized medicine.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

Gene expression patterns play a critical role in determining how genes interact with each other to contribute to complex traits. However, understanding the mechanisms underlying these interactions and their influence on disease has been challenging. Our study presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages transcriptome-wide association studies and gene co-expression data to map gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation. By grouping genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules. These findings suggest that PhenoPLIER can provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.">[PASS] (1.00)

This insight is critical for the development of new therapies, and transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach has important implications for therapeutic target discovery, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.">[PASS] (1.00)

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach is based on gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed genes that act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings reveal the potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and highlight the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in the interpretation of genetic associations. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER has broader significance as it can contextualize complex traits and facilitate drug discovery and repurposing.</td>

Determining how genes work together to influence complex traits is a critical aspect of understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This task requires a thorough understanding of expression regulation across different contexts. Our study shows that genetic associations are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we have used CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study has demonstrated the utility of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic associations, providing a novel framework for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the lens of gene modules.</td>

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, making it critical to understand how they affect complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players lacking associations but present in trait-associated modules.

The study of complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug mechanisms, requires an understanding of the interplay between genes and their expression patterns. Traditional approaches have focused on individual genes; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease development and progression. To address this gap, the authors introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies disease associations with specific gene groups expressed in relevant cell types. The authors show that their approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, the authors find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, this study highlights the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and demonstrates the potential of functional genomics to inform therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts.">[PASS] (1.00)
