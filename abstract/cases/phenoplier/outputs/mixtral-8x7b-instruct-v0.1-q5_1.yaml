          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER''s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables contextualization of genetic associations and identification of potential targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a robust tool for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery in complex traits.'

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across various conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes' role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation to enable joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate that functionally important players, lacking individual gene associations, can be prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Recognizing that genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts, we argue that understanding the regulation of expression across various conditions is essential to elucidate how genes influence complex traits, thereby facilitating the development of new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, PhenoPLIER demonstrates significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types' gene modules. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation via CRISPR screening reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might have been missed through conventional single-gene approaches. By interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms in the context of functional genomics.

           In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often function in concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, particularly in the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern complex trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By interpreting genetic associations through a gene module lens, PhenoPLIER introduces a new framework for functional genomics research, therapeutic target discovery, and drug repurposing.

           In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital in developing innovative therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential in disease etiology and progression.

          PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene
          modules when expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach
          demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes
          lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Collectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups
          enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights
          potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene
          strategies. Our method provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations via the perspective of gene modules, thereby
          shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

        output: ' The study of genetic associations is crucial for understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on individual genes, neglecting the importance of gene-gene interactions in complex trait architecture. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across conditions, our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules in relevant cell types.

        output: ' In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene''s contribution to disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, and we observe a significant association between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER''s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes frequently operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing effective new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression.

          PhenoPLIER's approach is centered on gene modules with comparable
          expression patterns across similar conditions. Our findings indicate
          that diseases are substantially associated with these gene modules in
          relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we
          discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual
          associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups
          enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights
          potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules offers a valuable tool for disease
          etiology research and drug mechanism exploration.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to orchestrate complex trait manifestation. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, ultimately facilitating the development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover functionally significant elements lacking associations, which are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations, illuminating potential targets that may otherwise be overlooked using single-gene methodologies. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, provides a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for enhanced therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' In the field of genetic studies, identifying how genes interact to influence complex traits is crucial for understanding disease etiology and developing effective therapies. However, a gap exists in our knowledge regarding the mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions and cell types. Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that addresses this gap by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and its utility in drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and complex trait clustering.'

        output: ' The interplay of genes in specific contexts, working in concert to execute their functions, is a fundamental aspect of genetics. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. Our study provides evidence that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, thereby validating the importance of our approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Through the use of a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lacking individual gene associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing these associations and revealing potential targets that may have been missed using single-gene strategies. This study highlights the value of functional genomics and gene co-expression in identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby advancing our understanding of complex traits clustering.'

           Genes frequently interact with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes as a strategy to contextualize genetic associations and uncover prospective targets that might have been missed by single-gene approaches. Consequently, PhenoPLIER establishes a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Genes operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions. Our study underscores the significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally critical genes, which lack genetic associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offered by PhenoPLIER facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules, thereby advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial elements devoid of associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual associations through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex traits.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, accumulating evidence suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space, enabling joint analysis. This common representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that complex traits are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential of this approach for identifying novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.'

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not fully capture the intricate web of gene-gene interactions that underlie disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This method clusters genes based on their expression patterns across various conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, our approach identifies functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By bridging the gap between individual gene-trait associations and complex gene-gene interactions, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms in functional genomics, with potential implications for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.'

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern genetic models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate that functionally important genes involved in lipid regulation, which lack individual associations, can be prioritized using trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential for drug repurposing and novel therapeutic target identification.

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

               Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               The development of effective therapies relies on a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant processes, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression (context). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method clusters genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions into modules and reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (content). Furthermore, PhenoPLIER excels at predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action while also identifying functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive perspective on genetic associations, uncovering potential targets otherwise overlooked by single-gene strategies (conclusion). This novel framework bridges the gap between gene expression and disease etiology, enabling more precise drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.

               Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to carry out their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires insight into the regulation of expression across various conditions. This mechanistic understanding is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been missed using single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across various conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes' role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation to enable joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate that functionally important players, lacking individual gene associations, can be prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Recognizing that genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts, we argue that understanding the regulation of expression across various conditions is essential to elucidate how genes influence complex traits, thereby facilitating the development of new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, PhenoPLIER demonstrates significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types' gene modules. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation via CRISPR screening reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might have been missed through conventional single-gene approaches. By interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms in the context of functional genomics.

            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across

            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes

            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,

            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized

               In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often function in concert with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, particularly in the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern complex trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By interpreting genetic associations through a gene module lens, PhenoPLIER introduces a new framework for functional genomics research, therapeutic target discovery, and drug repurposing.

               In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital in developing innovative therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential in disease etiology and progression.

              PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our
              findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
              these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types.
              Moreover, our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally significant genes lacking individual
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              Collectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene
              groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and
              highlights potential targets that may be overlooked through

              interpreting genetic associations via the perspective of gene

               The study of genetic associations is crucial for understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Traditional approaches have primarily focused on individual genes, neglecting the importance of gene-gene interactions in complex trait architecture. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across conditions, our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules in relevant cell types. Notably, PhenoPLIER successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies functionally important players lacking individual gene associations. These findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in functional genomics.

               In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's contribution to disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, and we observe a significant association between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. The keywords associated with this manuscript are 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.'

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes frequently operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing effective new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression.

              PhenoPLIER's approach is centered on gene modules with comparable
              expression patterns across similar conditions. Our findings
              indicate that diseases are substantially associated with these
              gene modules in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to
              examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
              genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups
              enables the contextualization of genetic associations and
              highlights potential targets that might be overlooked using
              single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting

              valuable tool for disease etiology research and drug mechanism
              exploration.

               The study of genetic associations is crucial for understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. However, traditional methods have predominantly focused on individual gene-trait associations, neglecting the complex interplay between genes that contribute to disease development. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on the concept that genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. By representing diseases as significant associations with modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, PhenoPLIER offers improved accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, by prioritizing functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations, PhenoPLIER reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis of genetic associations can provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules has broad implications for drug repurposing and precision medicine, highlighting the importance of functional genomics and gene co-expression in complex trait clustering.

              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to orchestrate complex trait manifestation. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, ultimately facilitating the development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover functionally significant elements lacking associations, which are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations, illuminating potential targets that may otherwise be overlooked using single-gene methodologies. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, provides a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for enhanced therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing strategies.

               The interplay of genes in specific contexts, working in concert to execute their functions, is a fundamental aspect of genetics. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits across various conditions is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and developing novel therapies. Our study provides evidence that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, thereby validating the importance of our approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Through the use of a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lacking individual gene associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing these associations and revealing potential targets that may have been missed using single-gene strategies. This study highlights the value of functional genomics and gene co-expression in identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing, thereby advancing our understanding of complex traits clustering.

               Genes frequently interact with each other in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players, which may otherwise be overlooked due to lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes as a strategy to contextualize genetic associations and uncover prospective targets that might have been missed by single-gene approaches. Consequently, PhenoPLIER establishes a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions. Our study underscores the significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally critical genes, which lack genetic associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offered by PhenoPLIER facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules, thereby advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is critical for the development of novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial elements devoid of associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            text: ' In the field of genetic studies, a major challenge is to understand how genes that act in concert with each other influence complex traits. This understanding is critical for developing effective therapies as it provides insights into the underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Current methods primarily focus on single-gene associations, which may overlook important functional players. Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that incorporates gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We illustrate this by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking single-gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, our approach provides a framework for functional genomics studies and drug repurposing, ultimately advancing the broader field of complex trait clustering.'

               In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open research question. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not fully capture the intricate web of gene-gene interactions that underlie disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This method clusters genes based on their expression patterns across various conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, our approach identifies functionally important players that lack individual gene-trait associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By bridging the gap between individual gene-trait associations and complex gene-gene interactions, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms in functional genomics, with potential implications for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.

               Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern genetic models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. This common representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate that functionally important genes involved in lipid regulation, which lack individual associations, can be prioritized using trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential for drug repurposing and novel therapeutic target identification.

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
