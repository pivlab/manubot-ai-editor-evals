          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in harmony to carry out their functions, and
          understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a
          deeper insight into gene expression regulation across various
          conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER â€“ a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we
          observe significant association between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. 


          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through groups of
          co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          offers a unique perspective on gene module-based drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          conditions is essential for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origins and progression.


          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach introduced here, maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating
          modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, we observed that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and
          accurately predict known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a comprehensive
          approach for interpreting genetic associations and drug repurposing
          opportunities in complex diseases, advancing our understanding of
          disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms.

          Gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait etiology, and
          understanding their influence requires a mechanistic examination of
          gene expression across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the individual roles of genes
          in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying
          complex traits, while functional genomics seeks to understand gene
          expression patterns across various conditions. Despite significant
          advances in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), a
          comprehensive understanding of genetic associations remains elusive
          due to limited mechanistic insights and insufficient coverage of gene
          interactions. The current gap is particularly evident when it comes to
          identifying potential therapeutic targets through the repurposing of
          existing drugs, as single-gene approaches often overlook crucial
          co-expression patterns among genes in complex traits.


          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis, by leveraging modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we observed functional importance players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.


          In conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER represents an innovative
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene module
          analysis and holds potential implications not only in drug repurposing
          but also in elucidating disease etiology and uncovering novel
          therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes are orchestrated to work together in specific contexts,
          contributing to the performance of their functions. To decipher
          complex traits and develop novel therapies, it is crucial to gain a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
          identified individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in
          disease etiology and progression.


          PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach, harnesses the power
          of gene co-expression patterns to map associations between traits,
          pharmacological perturbation data, and common latent representations
          for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar
          expression profiles across relevant cell types, we observed
          significant disease associations in these gene modules. PhenoPLIER's
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms is impressive, making it a powerful tool to uncover novel
          therapeutic targets.


          A CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed functional players
          lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene
          modules using the PhenoPLIER approach. In conclusion, incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize
          genetic associations and highlight potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. By doing so, this novel framework provides a
          comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying
          mechanisms through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes work together in harmony to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a
          mechanistic analysis of expression regulation across different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          identify the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By utilizing modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we
          observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action.


          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          found that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of disease etiology and
          therapeutic mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          This study aims to address a gap in the literature by presenting an
          innovative approach, PhenoPLIER, for projecting genetic associations
          through gene expression patterns. By integrating transcriptome-wide
          association studies with pharmacological perturbation data and
          clustering complex traits based on co-expressed genes, this method can
          provide a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.


          The context is the critical need to bridge the gap between single-gene
          strategies and functional genomics approaches for interpreting genetic
          associations in complex diseases. Our approach reveals potential
          targets missed by traditional methods while simultaneously providing
          insights into how these genes influence traits across diverse
          contexts.


          PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data onto a common latent representation of co-expressed
          genes, which is derived from modules exhibiting similar expression
          patterns within the same conditions. This method offers an accurate
          prediction of known drug-disease pairs and helps infer mechanisms of
          action in diseases by identifying gene modules that are significantly
          associated with specific traits.


          Our results demonstrate that this approach can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets, such as
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's CRISPR screen analysis
          on lipid regulation. In conclusion, by incorporating gene
          co-expression patterns, the novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER
          enables a more comprehensive understanding of genetic determinants and
          facilitates drug repurposing strategies for complex diseases.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes collaborate
          in specific contexts to perform their functions is crucial for
          deciphering complex traits. Current models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a central role in disease etiology and progression.
          However, transcriptome-wide association studies have only begun to
          uncover individual gene roles, leaving a significant gap in our
          knowledge of the mechanistic underpinnings of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions.


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIERâ€”a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By modeling genes
          with similar expression patterns as modules, PhenoPLIER identifies
          disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility by
          using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulationâ€”highlighting
          functionally important players that lack associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER's
          predictions.


          In conclusion, the incorporation of co-expressed gene groups through
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations and contextualizing complex traits, revealing potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings
          underscore the importance of analyzing genes in concert with one
          another to understand disease etiology and identify novel drug
          mechanisms, thus advancing functional genomics research and
          contributing to the field's broader scientific landscape.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach that
          harnesses gene expression patterns to map genetic associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into an integrated latent
          representation for joint analysis. By recognizing the concerted
          actions of genes in specific contexts, our method sheds light on
          complex traits by elucidating their underlying mechanisms. This
          insight is crucial for devising novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in
          disease processes; however, modern models emphasize that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of
          diseases.


          PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules with similar expression
          patterns across relevant cellular contexts. We observe significant
          associations between various diseases and specific gene modules, which
          validate our predictive accuracy for predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and elucidating their underlying mechanisms. Additionally,
          analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER but lack associations themselves.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers novel strategies to contextualize
          genetic associations by integrating gene co-expression patterns and
          unveils potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. This
          innovative framework allows for a comprehensive understanding of
          complex traits through the lens of gene modules.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have proven valuable in
          identifying individual gene roles within disease processes; however,
          modern models of complex traits predict a significant role for
          gene-gene interactions in origin and progression. To achieve this
          mechanistic insight, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across specific conditions, allowing us to
          observe associations between diseases and these co-expressed genetic
          elements. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action through the identification of
          functionally important players within trait-associated gene modules.


          To further validate PhenoPLIER's potential applications, we conducted
          a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, revealing that key functional
          components lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
          trait-associated modules. Thus, our method contextualizes genetic
          associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, ultimately providing insights into disease etiology and
          drug repurposing. 


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enriching
          understanding of complex trait development and facilitating targeted
          therapeutic interventions.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that
          translates genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          collaborate in concert to perform their functions; thus, understanding
          how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a deeper insight
          into expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge
          is instrumental in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play an essential part in disease etiology and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's approach identifies modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across identical conditions, revealing
          significant associations between diseases and these cellular-specific
          gene modules. Our method demonstrates accuracy in predicting
          well-established drug-disease pairs while also inferring mechanisms of
          action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally crucial players are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER but lack direct associations. In summary,
          through incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic links and uncovers potential targets missed by
          single-gene approaches. This novel framework provides a deeper
          understanding of complex traits and their associated gene modules.

          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In this study, we address the gap in our understanding of how gene
          co-expression patterns contribute to complex disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging
          gene module expression across different conditions, we gain insights
          into the mechanistic regulation of complex traits and develop new
          therapeutic strategies.


          We demonstrate the power of our method by identifying significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease
          pairs and their underlying mechanisms. Moreover, through a CRISPR
          screen on lipid regulation, we reveal that functionally important
          players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER
          despite lacking associations themselves.


          In conclusion, the integration of co-expressed gene groups with
          PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and
          uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
          modules provides a valuable tool for advancing functional genomics
          research in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge
          computational tool designed to analyze gene expression patterns and
          elucidate the intricate relationships between complex traits, genetic
          associations, and drug mechanisms. By harnessing transcriptome-wide
          association studies, our approach aims to provide a comprehensive
          understanding of how gene functions in concert with other genes within
          specific contexts, ultimately contributing to disease etiology and
          therapeutic target identification for various diseases. 


          PhenoPLIER's primary strength lies in its ability to identify groups
          of co-expressed genes that have been correlated with complex traits by
          leveraging modules of similar expression patterns across relevant cell
          types. This strategy enables us to better predict known drug-disease
          associations, as well as infer the mechanisms behind these
          relationships. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation, demonstrating how PhenoPLIER effectively identifies
          functional players and prioritizes them within trait-associated gene
          modules.


          In summary, by incorporating co-expressed genes into our analysis,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework to interpret genetic
          associations and uncover novel therapeutic targets that may have been
          overlooked through traditional single-gene strategies. This approach
          has significant implications for drug repurposing efforts and can
          further enhance the mechanistic understanding of complex traits
          associated with various diseases.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          PhenoPLIER: A Computational Approach for Projecting Genetic
          Associations and Revealing Therapeutic Mechanisms


          Background: To fill the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions,
          we propose PhenoPLIER - a computational method that maps genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This approach allows us to
          study complex traits by considering how genes act in concert with each
          other under different conditions. 


          Method: By analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies, we
          demonstrate the importance of understanding gene expression regulation
          in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER identifies modules
          of co-expressed genes across relevant cell types and uses them to
          predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their therapeutic
          mechanisms. We further validate our approach using a CRISPR screen on
          lipid regulation.


          Results: Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene expression patterns in specific cell types,
          validating the utility of our method for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets. Additionally, we find functional players
          prioritized in trait-associated modules but lacking associations,
          suggesting they could be valuable candidates for drug repurposing
          efforts. 


          Conclusion: PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover undiscovered therapeutic mechanisms
          by integrating groups of co-expressed genes. This approach has broad
          implications for understanding disease etiology and developing new
          therapies in the field of functional genomics.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes exhibit
          concerted action with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have aided in identifying individual gene roles in disease-related
          mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play an essential role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          representation relies on modules comprising genes with similar
          expression patterns across shared conditions. We find a strong
          correlation between diseases and expressed gene modules in relevant
          cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease
          pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation further validates our approach by revealing functionally
          significant players that lack associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and unearth potential targets
          missed through single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          enhances our understanding of complex traits and therapeutic
          mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          significantly associated with diseases, validating our method's
          ability to predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate disease
          etiology. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes using
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and unveils potential
          targets missed by single-gene approaches. This approach provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules.

          This research addresses the gap in understanding how gene expression
          patterns contribute to complex diseases and drug mechanisms. By
          focusing on co-expression of genes, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap
          between genetic studies and therapeutic targets. Our study reveals
          significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types using PhenoPLIER, a novel approach
          for repurposing drugs by contextualizing genetic associations. This
          methodology provides an accurate prediction of known drug-disease
          pairs and enhances our mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate
          its utility through the CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation,
          identifying functionally important players prioritized in
          trait-associated modules despite lacking associations. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER can offer a

          Gene expression patterns play a vital role in the concerted action of
          genes to perform their functions. To comprehend how these genes
          contribute to complex traits, we require a mechanistic understanding
          of gene regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is
          indispensable for advancing therapeutic development. Our study reveals
          that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms underlying

          screening to investigate lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          significant players lack associations but still contribute to

          Genetic studies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying
          complex traits. However, understanding the intricate interplay of

          gene co-expression patterns. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific cell types through our analysis
          of known drug-disease pairs, revealing novel mechanistic insights into
          therapeutic targets. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid
          regulation, we highlight the prioritization of functionally important
          players in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER - demonstrating its
          potential for gene co-expression clustering and drug repurposing. In
          conclusion, our work highlights the importance of incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover untapped therapeutic potentials missed by
          single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations, PhenoPLIER advances functional
          genomics research in drug repurposing and therapeutic target
          discovery.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate in a concerted manner to perform their functions,
          and deciphering how these genes contribute to complex traits
          necessitates an understanding of gene expression regulation across
          diverse conditions. It has been established that this knowledge is
          crucial for developing novel therapies. In our research project, we
          demonstrate the profound association between diseases and specific
          sets of co-expressed genes expressed in relevant cell types,
          accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
          mechanisms of action. 


          Using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we discovered that
          key players involved in these processes lack associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          summary, our approach integrates groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Through the lens of gene modules,
          PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic data,
          offering insights into drug repurposing opportunities in previously
          unexplored areas.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In this study, we explore the role of gene co-expression in
          determining complex traits and its implications for drug repurposing.
          Our findings highlight how functional genomics can shed light on
          disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms. By projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns, we identify significant
          correlations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. This approach allows us to predict known
          drug-disease pairs and infer their underlying mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules but lack associations. Our results emphasize the importance of
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic
          associations, as they can provide valuable insights into potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER serves as a novel framework for integrating gene modules
          and contextualizing genetic associations, offering new perspectives on
          drug repurposing and complex disease etiology.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Context: Recent advances in functional genomics have highlighted the
          importance of gene co-expression patterns for understanding complex
          traits and disease etiology. However, existing studies often overlook
          the potential of integrating these patterns to predict drug mechanisms
          and repurposing opportunities. Consequently, a gap exists in
          literature addressing the use of gene modules to project genetic
          associations and elucidate therapeutic targets.


          Content: In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          approach for projecting genetic associations through co-expression
          patterns among genes involved in complex traits. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, our method contextualized disease
          etiology and identified novel drug repurposing opportunities. We
          utilized a CRISPR screen to validate our findings on lipid regulation,
          revealing the potential of PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for
          predicting therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene
          strategies.


          Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that incorporating gene
          co-expression patterns significantly enhances genetic association
          projections and uncovers overlooked drug mechanisms and repurposing
          options in complex diseases. By employing our novel framework,
          PhenoPLIER, researchers can now more accurately predict the etiology
          of disease and identify potential therapeutic targets to address a
          wide range of complex traits.

          Genes work together in various contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is
          crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across different conditions. This knowledge has become
          essential for developing novel therapies. In this study, we
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with specific gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known
          drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation,
          our results reveal that functionally crucial players lack associations
          but still appear prioritized within trait-associated modules through
          PhenoPLIER's co-expression analysis. In conclusion, incorporating gene
          modules through the PhenoPLIER approach can contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations sheds light on the role of gene modules in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes are known to act in concert with each other, regulating complex
          traits through expression regulation across different conditions.
          However, a mechanistic understanding of gene co-expression is crucial
          for developing new therapies. In this study, we project genetic
          associations using gene expression patterns and highlight disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms by analyzing relevant cell types. We show
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in these cells and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, as
          well as inferring the mechanism of action. Additionally, using a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find functionally important
          players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes with our novel method, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This framework provides a valuable tool for
          interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, moving the
          field forward.

          Genes function in harmony, orchestrating complex processes. To fully
          comprehend their roles in determining intricate traits, an
          understanding of gene expression regulation across various contexts is
          essential. This knowledge has proven vital for advancing therapeutic
          advancements by identifying the functional role individual genes play
          in disease mechanisms. However, modern research suggests that genetic
          interactions contribute significantly to disease etiology and
          progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER â€“ a novel computational
          approach designed to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. Based on modules of genes displaying similar expression
          patterns across identical conditions, this method enables the
          identification of diseases that are strongly associated with specific
          cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs,
          elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing CRISPR
          screening to examine lipid regulation, we discovered functionally
          important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The context of this paper is the study of genetic associations through
          gene expression patterns, focusing on disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. The gap in current literature is that while
          transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes involved in disease processes, a mechanistic understanding of
          gene co-expression across different conditions is essential to develop
          new therapies. Modern models predict that complex traits are driven by
          gene-gene interactions.


          The content introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into common latent representations based on genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing diseases
          associated with specific cell types and predicting known drug-disease
          pairs accurately, it demonstrates its usefulness in identifying
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.


          The conclusion interprets these findings by showing that PhenoPLIER
          effectively identifies disease mechanisms and prioritizes functionally
          important players involved in complex trait regulation. This paper
          fills a gap in the literature by providing a novel method for
          understanding gene co-expression patterns, which can be crucial to
          developing new therapies and drug repurposing strategies.

          Genes collaborate in concert to execute their functions within
          specific contexts. Understanding the intricate interplay of gene
          expression and its regulation is essential for deciphering complex
          traits and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Though
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms, recent advances in genomics
          indicate that gene-gene interactions hold crucial importance in
          determining the origin and progression of diseases.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach for mapping
          associations between genetic traits and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          innovative method leverages modules of genes displaying similar
          expression patterns across relevant cell types, enabling us to project
          gene-trait relationships with enhanced accuracy. We demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in
          disease-relevant cellular contexts, validating our approach's ability
          to predict known drug-disease associations and elucidate their
          underlying mechanisms.


          Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we reveal
          that functionally important players do not exhibit strong association
          signals but still emerge as prioritized traits-associated modules
          identified by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of
          our method to identify novel therapeutic targets and support drug
          repurposing strategies in diverse disease contexts.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining complex
          traits, highlighting the importance of understanding gene-gene
          interactions for disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
          existing methods fail to capture this intricate interplay effectively.
          Consequently, new therapies often fall short in addressing the root
          causes of diseases. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER â€“ a
          novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By utilizing modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across relevant cell types, our method effectively
          projects genetic associations and enables accurate prediction of known
          drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          utilize a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only fills
          the current gap in literature regarding gene co-expression but also
          paves the way for drug repurposing strategies based on our findings,
          ultimately moving the field forward with promising therapeutic targets
          and insights into disease etiology.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          highlighting the importance of understanding gene expression
          regulation across various conditions for complex trait analysis.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease etiology and
          progression. 


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach mapping gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions, revealing associations between diseases and cell
          types as well as accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          mechanisms of action.


          Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players in trait-associated gene modules lack
          associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER. These findings
          highlight the potential for drug repurposing using our approach to
          identify novel therapeutic targets and improve treatment efficacy.

          In the context of genetic studies and functional genomics, this
          manuscript addresses a gap by proposing an innovative approach to gene
          co-expression analysis in complex traits. Our study aims to uncover
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms through projecting gene
          expression patterns. The content section presents PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates transcriptome data with
          pharmacological perturbation information, enabling the mapping of
          trait associations onto common latent representations derived from
          modules exhibiting similar expression profiles across different
          conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action and identifying
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized
          within trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight a novel
          perspective on disease etiology and suggest potential avenues for drug
          repurposing by leveraging gene co-expression patterns.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes collaborate in the performance of their functions, and a deeper
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different contexts
          is essential for deciphering complex traits. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in
          disease mechanisms; however, modern approaches to the study of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play an instrumental role
          in disease etiology and progression. To address this challenge, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method for mapping gene-trait
          associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation. This approach is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant cellular
          contexts. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with these modules, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and
          infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally crucial players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential for gene
          co-expression patterns as a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic
          targets and drug repurposing strategies in complex diseases.

          in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          This research addresses the critical need for a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation in complex traits, which
          is essential for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have identified individual genes' role in disease
          mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present
          PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our
          method reveals significant associations between diseases and specific
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our
          findings accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action, highlighting potential therapeutic targets.
          Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking associations. Overall, this work
          fills an essential gap in the literature on functional genomics and
          advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genes work together in harmony to carry out their functions, and
              understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits
              requires a deeper insight into gene expression regulation across
              various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER â€“ a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we observe
              significant association between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
              action. 


              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through
              groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations offers a unique perspective on gene
              module-based drug repurposing.

              In the study of complex traits, genes act in concert with each
              other under specific contexts to perform their functions. To gain
              a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              various conditions is essential for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the
              role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origins and progression.


              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach introduced here, maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
              incorporating modules of co-expressed genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, we observed that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease
              pairs as well as mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a
              comprehensive approach for interpreting genetic associations and

              Gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait etiology,
              and understanding their influence requires a mechanistic
              examination of gene expression across different conditions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              individual roles of genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions are key to disease
              origin and progression. To address this, we present PhenoPLIER â€“ a
              computational approach mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Built upon modules of
              co-expressed genes across relevant cell types, our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through CRISPR screening of
              lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. Overall, integrating groups of co-expressed genes
              with PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies, offering insights into therapeutic
              targeting and drug repurposing.

              Genetic studies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying
              complex traits, while functional genomics seeks to understand gene
              expression patterns across various conditions. Despite significant
              advances in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), a
              comprehensive understanding of genetic associations remains
              elusive due to limited mechanistic insights and insufficient
              coverage of gene interactions. The current gap is particularly
              evident when it comes to identifying potential therapeutic targets
              through the repurposing of existing drugs, as single-gene
              approaches often overlook crucial co-expression patterns among
              genes in complex traits.


              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, by leveraging modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our findings show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we observed
              functional importance players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.


              In conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER represents an
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              gene module analysis and holds potential implications not only in
              drug repurposing but also in elucidating disease etiology and
              uncovering novel therapeutic targets.

              Genes are orchestrated to work together in specific contexts,
              contributing to the performance of their functions. To decipher
              complex traits and develop novel therapies, it is crucial to gain
              a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. Although transcriptome-wide association
              studies have identified individual genes' roles in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a vital role in disease etiology and progression.


              PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach, harnesses the
              power of gene co-expression patterns to map associations between
              traits, pharmacological perturbation data, and common latent
              representations for joint analysis. By identifying modules of
              genes with similar expression profiles across relevant cell types,
              we observed significant disease associations in these gene
              modules. PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms is impressive, making it a powerful
              tool to uncover novel therapeutic targets.


              A CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed functional players
              lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene
              modules using the PhenoPLIER approach. In conclusion,
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to
              contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. By doing so, this novel
              framework provides a comprehensive understanding of complex traits
              and their underlying mechanisms through the lens of gene modules.

              In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene expression
              patterns is critical for elucidating complex trait etiology and
              identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, traditional
              methods may overlook crucial gene-gene interactions in disease
              origin and progression. To address this gap, we developed
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. By using modules of
              co-expressed genes across relevant conditions, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen highlights
              functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating gene modules with
              co-expression patterns through PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach has broad implications for drug repurposing and
              furthers our mechanistic understanding of complex trait etiology.

              This study aims to address a gap in the literature by presenting
              an innovative approach, PhenoPLIER, for projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns. By integrating
              transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological
              perturbation data and clustering complex traits based on
              co-expressed genes, this method can provide a mechanistic
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


              The context is the critical need to bridge the gap between
              single-gene strategies and functional genomics approaches for
              interpreting genetic associations in complex diseases. Our
              approach reveals potential targets missed by traditional methods
              while simultaneously providing insights into how these genes
              influence traits across diverse contexts.


              PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data onto a common latent representation of
              co-expressed genes, which is derived from modules exhibiting
              similar expression patterns within the same conditions. This
              method offers an accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs
              and helps infer mechanisms of action in diseases by identifying
              gene modules that are significantly associated with specific
              traits.


              Our results demonstrate that this approach can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets,
              such as functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's
              CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation. In conclusion, by
              incorporating gene co-expression patterns, the novel framework
              provided by PhenoPLIER enables a more comprehensive understanding
              of genetic determinants and facilitates drug repurposing
              strategies for complex diseases.

              Genes interact in concert with each other to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic approach that considers expression
              regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. 


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method to map gene-trait
              associations into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes
              across the same conditions, identifying relevant cell types where
              diseases are significantly associated with gene expression
              patterns. Our findings accurately predict known drug-disease pairs
              and infer mechanisms of action. 


              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through
              co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a promising
              approach for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering
              novel drug mechanisms.

              In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes
              collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions is
              crucial for deciphering complex traits. Current models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a central role in disease
              etiology and progression. However, transcriptome-wide association
              studies have only begun to uncover individual gene roles, leaving
              a significant gap in our knowledge of the mechanistic
              underpinnings of expression regulation across diverse conditions.


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIERâ€”a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By modeling
              genes with similar expression patterns as modules, PhenoPLIER
              identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate its
              utility by using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
              regulationâ€”highlighting functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              via PhenoPLIER's predictions.


              In conclusion, the incorporation of co-expressed gene groups
              through PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations and contextualizing complex traits, revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our findings underscore the importance of analyzing genes in
              concert with one another to understand disease etiology and
              identify novel drug mechanisms, thus advancing functional genomics
              research and contributing to the field's broader scientific
              landscape.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational approach
              that harnesses gene expression patterns to map genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into an
              integrated latent representation for joint analysis. By
              recognizing the concerted actions of genes in specific contexts,
              our method sheds light on complex traits by elucidating their
              underlying mechanisms. This insight is crucial for devising novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              identify individual gene roles in disease processes; however,
              modern models emphasize that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in the origin and progression of diseases.


              PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules with similar expression
              patterns across relevant cellular contexts. We observe significant
              associations between various diseases and specific gene modules,
              which validate our predictive accuracy for predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating their underlying mechanisms.
              Additionally, analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we
              find that functionally important players are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack associations
              themselves.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers novel strategies to contextualize
              genetic associations by integrating gene co-expression patterns
              and unveils potential targets missed by single-gene approaches.
              This innovative framework allows for a comprehensive understanding
              of complex traits through the lens of gene modules.

              Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. By determining how genes
              influence complex traits with mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, we provide a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules. Our method reveals potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies in drug repurposing and identifies key
              players involved in disease origin and progression using
              transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). We demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate
              the importance of PhenoPLIER's approach by finding that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen on
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, our study fills an essential gap
              in understanding genetic studies by projecting gene expression
              patterns and unveiling disease etiology and drug mechanisms using
              functional genomics.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed
              to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics.
              By mapping gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for
              complex trait development. Recognizing that genes act in concert
              with each other to perform their functions, our focus is on
              understanding how these co-expressed genes influence disease
              etiology and potential therapeutic targets. 


              Transcriptome-wide association studies have proven valuable in
              identifying individual gene roles within disease processes;
              however, modern models of complex traits predict a significant
              role for gene-gene interactions in origin and progression. To
              achieve this mechanistic insight, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions,
              allowing us to observe associations between diseases and these
              co-expressed genetic elements. Our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action through the identification of functionally important
              players within trait-associated gene modules.


              To further validate PhenoPLIER's potential applications, we
              conducted a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, revealing that key
              functional components lacking associations are prioritized by
              PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. Thus, our method
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately providing insights
              into disease etiology and drug repurposing. 


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, enriching understanding of complex trait development and
              facilitating targeted therapeutic interventions.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,

            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that
              translates genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive
              analysis. Genes collaborate in concert to perform their functions;
              thus, understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a deeper insight into expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. This knowledge is instrumental in developing
              novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play an
              essential part in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions, revealing significant
              associations between diseases and these cellular-specific gene
              modules. Our method demonstrates accuracy in predicting
              well-established drug-disease pairs while also inferring
              mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally crucial players are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack
              direct associations. In summary, through incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic links and
              uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. This
              novel framework provides a deeper understanding of complex traits
              and their associated gene modules.

              In this study, we address the gap in our understanding of how gene
              co-expression patterns contribute to complex disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By leveraging gene module expression across different
              conditions, we gain insights into the mechanistic regulation of
              complex traits and develop new therapeutic strategies.


              We demonstrate the power of our method by identifying significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known
              drug-disease pairs and their underlying mechanisms. Moreover,
              through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we reveal that
              functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking associations themselves.


              In conclusion, the integration of co-expressed gene groups with
              PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and
              uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
              modules provides a valuable tool for advancing functional genomics
              research in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge
              computational tool designed to analyze gene expression patterns
              and elucidate the intricate relationships between complex traits,
              genetic associations, and drug mechanisms. By harnessing
              transcriptome-wide association studies, our approach aims to
              provide a comprehensive understanding of how gene functions in
              concert with other genes within specific contexts, ultimately
              contributing to disease etiology and therapeutic target
              identification for various diseases. 


              PhenoPLIER's primary strength lies in its ability to identify
              groups of co-expressed genes that have been correlated with
              complex traits by leveraging modules of similar expression
              patterns across relevant cell types. This strategy enables us to
              better predict known drug-disease associations, as well as infer
              the mechanisms behind these relationships. Additionally, we use a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, demonstrating how PhenoPLIER
              effectively identifies functional players and prioritizes them
              within trait-associated gene modules.


              In summary, by incorporating co-expressed genes into our analysis,
              PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework to interpret genetic
              associations and uncover novel therapeutic targets that may have
              been overlooked through traditional single-gene strategies. This
              approach has significant implications for drug repurposing efforts
              and can further enhance the mechanistic understanding of complex
              traits associated with various diseases.

              PhenoPLIER: A Computational Approach for Projecting Genetic
              Associations and Revealing Therapeutic Mechanisms


              Background: To fill the gap in understanding gene-gene
              interactions, we propose PhenoPLIER - a computational method that
              maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              approach allows us to study complex traits by considering how
              genes act in concert with each other under different conditions. 


              Method: By analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies, we
              demonstrate the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER
              identifies modules of co-expressed genes across relevant cell
              types and uses them to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
              their therapeutic mechanisms. We further validate our approach
              using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation.


              Results: Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene expression patterns in specific cell types,
              validating the utility of our method for identifying potential
              therapeutic targets. Additionally, we find functional players
              prioritized in trait-associated modules but lacking associations,
              suggesting they could be valuable candidates for drug repurposing
              efforts. 


              Conclusion: PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to contextualize
              genetic associations and uncover undiscovered therapeutic
              mechanisms by integrating groups of co-expressed genes. This
              approach has broad implications for understanding disease etiology
              and developing new therapies in the field of functional genomics.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes exhibit
              concerted action with each other in specific contexts to perform
              their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is
              crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have aided in identifying individual gene
              roles in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in
              disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies
              on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns
              across shared conditions. We find a strong correlation between
              diseases and expressed gene modules in relevant cell types, as
              well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation further validates our approach by revealing
              functionally significant players that lack associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and unearth
              potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. By
              providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              via gene modules, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of complex
              traits and therapeutic mechanisms.

              Genes interact in intricate networks to perform their functions,
              and understanding how they influence complex traits demands a
              mechanistic examination of expression regulation across various
              conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of novel
              therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that genes expressed in
              relevant cell types are significantly associated with diseases,
              validating our method's ability to predict known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidate disease etiology. Moreover, employing CRISPR
              screening to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally
              important players lacking associations but prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating
              groups of co-expressed genes using PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and unveils potential targets missed by
              single-gene approaches. This approach provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules.

              This research addresses the gap in understanding how gene
              expression patterns contribute to complex diseases and drug
              mechanisms. By focusing on co-expression of genes, we aim to
              bridge the knowledge gap between genetic studies and therapeutic
              targets. Our study reveals significant associations between
              diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types using PhenoPLIER, a novel approach for repurposing drugs by
              contextualizing genetic associations. This methodology provides an
              accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and enhances our
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility
              through the CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation,
              identifying functionally important players prioritized in
              trait-associated modules despite lacking associations. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes with
              PhenoPLIER can offer a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, thus advancing our knowledge on disease etiology and

              Gene expression patterns play a vital role in the concerted action
              of genes to perform their functions. To comprehend how these genes
              contribute to complex traits, we require a mechanistic
              understanding of gene regulation across different conditions. This
              knowledge is indispensable for advancing therapeutic development.
              Our study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
              specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates the mechanisms underlying their effects on target
              tissues. Furthermore, employing CRISPR screening to investigate
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players
              lack associations but still contribute to trait-associated gene
              modules through PhenoPLIER prioritization. In summary, by

              Genetic studies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying
              complex traits. However, understanding the intricate interplay of
              genes and their expression patterns in distinct contexts remains a
              challenge. Our study addresses this gap by developing PhenoPLIER -
              an innovative approach for predicting drug repurposing targets
              based on gene co-expression patterns. We demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with specific cell types through our
              analysis of known drug-disease pairs, revealing novel mechanistic
              insights into therapeutic targets. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
              to study lipid regulation, we highlight the prioritization of
              functionally important players in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER - demonstrating its potential for gene co-expression
              clustering and drug repurposing. In conclusion, our work
              highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes through PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover untapped therapeutic potentials missed by single-gene
              strategies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations, PhenoPLIER advances functional genomics
              research in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.

              Genes collaborate in a concerted manner to perform their
              functions, and deciphering how these genes contribute to complex
              traits necessitates an understanding of gene expression regulation
              across diverse conditions. It has been established that this
              knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. In our
              research project, we demonstrate the profound association between
              diseases and specific sets of co-expressed genes expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. 


              Using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we discovered
              that key players involved in these processes lack associations but
              are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, our approach integrates groups of

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              making it crucial to understand how they regulate expression
              across different conditions for complex trait development. This
              understanding is vital for the discovery of new therapies. Our
              study reveals that diseases are significantly linked with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. We
              further demonstrate the importance of PhenoPLIER, which identifies
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by our CRISPR screen on
              lipid regulation. In conclusion, using groups of co-expressed
              genes with PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              uncover novel targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              innovative framework sheds light on the potential implications for
              drug repurposing, providing a promising approach to interpreting
              complex genetic traits.

              In this study, we explore the role of gene co-expression in
              determining complex traits and its implications for drug
              repurposing. Our findings highlight how functional genomics can
              shed light on disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms. By
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
              we identify significant correlations between diseases and specific
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. This approach
              allows us to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their
              underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players are prioritized in trait-associated modules but lack
              associations. Our results emphasize the importance of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes when interpreting
              genetic associations, as they can provide valuable insights into
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER serves as a novel framework for integrating
              gene modules and contextualizing genetic associations, offering
              new perspectives on drug repurposing and complex disease etiology.

              Context: Recent advances in functional genomics have highlighted
              the importance of gene co-expression patterns for understanding
              complex traits and disease etiology. However, existing studies
              often overlook the potential of integrating these patterns to
              predict drug mechanisms and repurposing opportunities.
              Consequently, a gap exists in literature addressing the use of
              gene modules to project genetic associations and elucidate
              therapeutic targets.


              Content: In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              approach for projecting genetic associations through co-expression
              patterns among genes involved in complex traits. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, our method contextualized disease
              etiology and identified novel drug repurposing opportunities. We
              utilized a CRISPR screen to validate our findings on lipid
              regulation, revealing the potential of PhenoPLIER as a powerful
              tool for predicting therapeutic targets missed by traditional
              single-gene strategies.


              Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that incorporating gene
              co-expression patterns significantly enhances genetic association
              projections and uncovers overlooked drug mechanisms and
              repurposing options in complex diseases. By employing our novel
              framework, PhenoPLIER, researchers can now more accurately predict
              the etiology of disease and identify potential therapeutic targets
              to address a wide range of complex traits.

              Genes work together in various contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes contribute to complex
              traits, it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge
              has become essential for developing novel therapies. In this
              study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with
              specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
              predicting known drug-disease relationships and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation, our results reveal that functionally
              crucial players lack associations but still appear prioritized
              within trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's co-expression
              analysis. In conclusion, incorporating gene modules through the
              PhenoPLIER approach can contextualize genetic associations and
              identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations sheds
              light on the role of gene modules in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              Genes are known to act in concert with each other, regulating
              complex traits through expression regulation across different
              conditions. However, a mechanistic understanding of gene
              co-expression is crucial for developing new therapies. In this
              study, we project genetic associations using gene expression
              patterns and highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms by
              analyzing relevant cell types. We show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in these
              cells and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, as well as
              inferring the mechanism of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation, we find functionally important
              players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes function in harmony, orchestrating complex processes. To
              fully comprehend their roles in determining intricate traits, an
              understanding of gene expression regulation across various
              contexts is essential. This knowledge has proven vital for
              advancing therapeutic advancements by identifying the functional
              role individual genes play in disease mechanisms. However, modern
              research suggests that genetic interactions contribute
              significantly to disease etiology and progression. Herein, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER â€“ a novel computational approach designed to
              map gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data
              into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on
              modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions, this method enables the identification of
              diseases that are strongly associated with specific cell types and
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing CRISPR screening to
              examine lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important
              players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The context of this paper is the study of genetic associations
              through gene expression patterns, focusing on disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. The gap in current literature is that while
              transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
              genes involved in disease processes, a mechanistic understanding
              of gene co-expression across different conditions is essential to
              develop new therapies. Modern models predict that complex traits
              are driven by gene-gene interactions.


              The content introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for
              mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into common latent representations based on genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              analyzing diseases associated with specific cell types and
              predicting known drug-disease pairs accurately, it demonstrates
              its usefulness in identifying therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing opportunities.


              The conclusion interprets these findings by showing that
              PhenoPLIER effectively identifies disease mechanisms and
              prioritizes functionally important players involved in complex
              trait regulation. This paper fills a gap in the literature by
              providing a novel method for understanding gene co-expression
              patterns, which can be crucial to developing new therapies and
              drug repurposing strategies.

              Genes collaborate in concert to execute their functions within
              specific contexts. Understanding the intricate interplay of gene
              expression and its regulation is essential for deciphering complex
              traits and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Though
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, recent advances in
              genomics indicate that gene-gene interactions hold crucial
              importance in determining the origin and progression of diseases.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach for mapping
              associations between genetic traits and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This innovative method leverages modules of genes
              displaying similar expression patterns across relevant cell types,
              enabling us to project gene-trait relationships with enhanced
              accuracy. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with modules expressed in disease-relevant cellular
              contexts, validating our approach's ability to predict known
              drug-disease associations and elucidate their underlying
              mechanisms.


              Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
              reveal that functionally important players do not exhibit strong
              association signals but still emerge as prioritized
              traits-associated modules identified by PhenoPLIER. These findings
              highlight the potential of our method to identify novel
              therapeutic targets and support drug repurposing strategies in
              diverse disease contexts.

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining
              complex traits, highlighting the importance of understanding
              gene-gene interactions for disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              However, existing methods fail to capture this intricate interplay
              effectively. Consequently, new therapies often fall short in
              addressing the root causes of diseases. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER â€“ a novel computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By utilizing
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant
              cell types, our method effectively projects genetic associations
              and enables accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs as
              well as mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilize a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and discover that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only fills
              the current gap in literature regarding gene co-expression but
              also paves the way for drug repurposing strategies based on our
              findings, ultimately moving the field forward with promising
              therapeutic targets and insights into disease etiology.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              highlighting the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation across various conditions for complex trait analysis.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
              genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease etiology and
              progression.

              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This

              associations between diseases and cell types as well as accurately
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.


              Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found
              that functionally important players in trait-associated gene
              modules lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER. These

              In the context of genetic studies and functional genomics, this
              manuscript addresses a gap by proposing an innovative approach to
              gene co-expression analysis in complex traits. Our study aims to
              uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms through projecting
              gene expression patterns. The content section presents PhenoPLIER,
              a computational method that integrates transcriptome data with
              pharmacological perturbation information, enabling the mapping of
              trait associations onto common latent representations derived from
              modules exhibiting similar expression profiles across different
              conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action and identifying
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules. Our findings
              highlight a novel perspective on disease etiology and suggest
              potential avenues for drug repurposing by leveraging gene
              co-expression patterns.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate in the performance of their functions, and a
              deeper understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different contexts is essential for deciphering complex traits.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              approaches to the study of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play an instrumental role in disease etiology and
              progression. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method for mapping gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation. This approach is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant cellular
              contexts. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with these modules, accurately predict known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using
              CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally crucial players lack associations but are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings
              highlight the potential for gene co-expression patterns as a
              powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing strategies in complex diseases.

              Genes work together to perform their functions in concert. To
              understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different conditions
              is essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have provided insights into the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression.


              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach to map gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is

              the same conditions, revealing significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, analyzing lipid regulation
              using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack

              This research addresses the critical need for a mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation in complex traits,
              which is essential for developing novel therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
              genes' role in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
              and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER - a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our
              method reveals significant associations between diseases and
              specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, our findings accurately predict known drug-disease
              pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting potential
              therapeutic targets. Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite
              lacking associations. Overall, this work fills an essential gap in
              the literature on functional genomics and advances our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
