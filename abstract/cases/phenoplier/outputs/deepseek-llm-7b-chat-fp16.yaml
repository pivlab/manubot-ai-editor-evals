          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies have traditionally focused on the role of individual
          genes in complex traits. However, recent advances in functional
          genomics and transcriptome-wide association studies suggest that gene
          co-expression plays a crucial role in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. To gain insight into these interactions, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This method leverages
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions to project genetic associations and predict potential
          therapeutic targets.


          Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we utilize a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          revealing functionally important players lacking associations but
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, our approach contextualizes genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, potentially uncovering novel therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding gene expression
          patterns is crucial for elucidating complex traits and developing
          novel therapeutic strategies. Despite significant advances in
          transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), a comprehensive
          mechanistic explanation remains elusive due to the role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology. The current gap in literature
          highlights the need for a more integrated approach that considers
          co-expression patterns among genes, such as PhenoPLIER.


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational method designed to map genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation, utilizing gene modules with similar expression
          profiles across specific conditions. Our findings demonstrate
          significant correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of our approach in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and identifying mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, we validate PhenoPLIER using CRISPR screening for
          lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes through the
          use of gene modules provides a novel framework to interpret genetic
          associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. By contextualizing genetic associations using this
          approach, we contribute to advancing drug repurposing efforts and
          enhancing our understanding of complex trait origins.

          Genes function in concert with one another to perform their functions,

          necessitates a mechanistic analysis of expression regulation across
          diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new

          However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, reveals the context of
          genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed groups of genes.
          The method allows accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action in complex traits. Moreover, through a
          CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules, emphasizing PhenoPLIER's potential for uncovering missed
          therapeutic targets. This study highlights the importance of gene
          module analysis for understanding disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, filling an essential gap in current genetic studies by
          bridging functional genomics with therapeutic target discovery.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, it is
          increasingly recognized that understanding gene expression patterns
          across different conditions is essential for determining how genes
          contribute to complex traits. Despite advances in transcriptome-wide
          association studies, a mechanistic understanding of these interactions
          remains crucial for developing new therapies. Modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and
          progression of diseases.


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced in this study,
          which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
          utilizing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          conclusion, this study's novel approach contextualizes genetic
          associations through the analysis of co-expressed genes and reveals
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By utilizing the
          power of gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for
          interpreting complex genetic traits and moving forward in drug
          repurposing efforts.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate with each other to perform their functions in
          specific contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex
          traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          various conditions is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origins
          and progression.


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach introduced to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns across the same
          conditions, revealing that diseases are significantly associated with
          these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs, and inferring mechanisms of
          action.


          Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a new
          perspective on interpreting genetic associations and understanding
          complex diseases.

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the study of complex traits, genes collaborate and interact within
          specific contexts to perform their functions. A mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions
          is essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided insight into individual gene roles
          in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through the
          lens of gene modules can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework provided by PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of complex
          traits and could be applied to drug repurposing efforts for improved
          therapeutic outcomes.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that
          harnesses gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation
          data to elucidate genetic associations for complex traits. The study
          of genes in concert with each other is crucial for understanding their
          functions in diverse contexts. This approach has implications for drug
          repurposing by identifying molecular targets associated with various
          diseases.


          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene roles in disease mechanisms, but recent insights from systems
          biology suggest that the role of gene interactions cannot be ignored.
          PhenoPLIER's innovative technique represents genes based on their
          co-expression patterns across identical conditions, providing insight
          into the interplay between various cell types and contributing to
          understanding complex traits.


          Our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease associations,
          offering valuable insights into disease etiology. Further
          investigation of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen demonstrates
          that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This method allows for
          contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers an invaluable tool to interpret
          genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns,
          providing a novel framework for identifying therapeutic targets and
          drug repurposing opportunities in various diseases.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that
          harnesses gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation
          information to map genetic trait associations into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. By exploring the interplay of genes
          in concert with each other across various contexts, we gain valuable
          insights into complex traits' molecular mechanisms, crucial for
          developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms;
          however, modern theories suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          central role in disease origin and progression.


          PhenoPLIER employs modules of co-expressed genes with similar
          expression patterns across shared conditions to elucidate associations
          between diseases and specific cell types. Our approach effectively
          identifies known drug-disease pairs and accurately predicts their
          underlying mechanisms, thereby offering valuable guidance for
          therapeutic strategies. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack
          significant associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
          gene modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework
          provides a novel interpretation of complex genetic traits through the
          lens of gene expression patterns and gene modules.

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In this study, we address a critical gap in the literature by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. The discovery of
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions, where genes act in concert to
          perform their functions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms;
          however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's novel
          method leverages modules of co-expressed genes across relevant cell
          types to map significant associations with diseases. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers the underlying
          mechanisms for treatment success. Additionally, we validate our
          findings using a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation,
          demonstrating that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This study presents a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which has broader implications in drug repurposing and
          understanding disease etiology.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool designed to integrate
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By recognizing that
          genes collaborate together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, we emphasize the importance of understanding expression
          regulation across diverse conditions when determining complex trait
          influence. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual gene
          contributions to disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology
          and progression.


          PhenoPLIER constructs modules of genes with shared expression patterns
          across relevant conditions, revealing significant associations between
          diseases and specific cell type-specific gene modules. The method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms
          of action for therapeutic targets. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen
          to study lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite
          lacking direct associations. In conclusion, incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
          potential drug repurposing opportunities missed through single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations via gene module analysis.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          integrates genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data
          in a unified latent representation for joint analysis. We recognize
          that genes collaborate together to perform their functions, and
          understanding these interactions is crucial in determining the impact
          of complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          previously revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms;
          however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an
          essential part in disease etiology. PhenoPLIER's approach derives from
          modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our study reveals significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed within relevant cell
          types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally critical players
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite
          lacking direct associations. In conclusion, integrating groups of
          co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations and unearth potential targets missed by single-gene
          approaches. By utilizing gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations, offering valuable
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          This study fills a gap in our understanding of genetic associations by
          projecting gene expression patterns into functional genomic contexts.
          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data to map these complex interactions onto common latent
          representations for joint analysis. By examining the co-expression of
          genes across different conditions, we gain insight into their
          mechanistic roles in influencing complex traits. This knowledge is
          crucial for developing new therapies. However, recent models predict a
          significant role for gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression.


          PhenoPLIER represents these interactions by clustering similar
          expression patterns among genes with the same conditions. Our analysis
          reveals strong associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, we accurately predict
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action through
          this approach. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules.


          In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes with
          PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic associations
          and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This study provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene modules, highlighting their
          importance in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          find functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated
          modules despite lacking associations. Our results demonstrate the
          accuracy of predicting known drug-disease pairs and providing insights
          into the mechanisms of action for diseases significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through co-expressed gene groups, offering potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies and moving our understanding
          forward in functional genomics research.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          necessitating a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions for determining complex traits'
          influence. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. In
          this study, we found that diseases are significantly associated with
          cell-type-specific gene modules expressed and our method accurately

          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we

          highlight the potential for contextualizing genetic associations
          through gene module co-expression using PhenoPLIER, which provides a
          novel framework for interpreting these associations and revealing

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The study addresses a critical gap in the literature, as genetic
          studies are limited by their inability to fully capture complex traits
          through single-gene approaches. The research presents a novel method
          called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene co-expression patterns to
          project genetic associations and elucidate disease etiology. By
          integrating this approach with functional genomics tools like CRISPR
          screens, the study uncovers potential therapeutic targets for drug
          repurposing in previously untapped areas of biological knowledge. In
          conclusion, by contextualizing genetic associations through gene
          modules, PhenoPLIER contributes a novel framework for interpreting
          complex traits and identifying new targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, potentially revolutionizing the field of functional
          genomics and therapeutic drug development.

          Genes operate in concert with one another, playing pivotal roles
          within specific contexts to fulfill their functions. To comprehend the
          intricate interplay of genes and understand how they contribute to
          complex traits, it is crucial to analyze gene expression regulation
          across diverse conditions. This understanding has proven vital for
          developing novel therapeutic approaches. Our research presents a
          significant breakthrough by demonstrating that diseases exhibit strong
          associations with cell-type-specific gene modules, accurately
          predicting known drug-disease relationships, and elucidating their
          underlying mechanisms of action.


          Using CRISPR screening to study lipid regulation, we found that key
          players in this biological process lack associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
          findings emphasize the utility of incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes as a context for interpreting genetic associations and unveiling
          potential therapeutic targets missed through traditional single-gene
          strategies. The novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER offers an
          innovative approach to interpreting genetic data, highlighting how
          gene module analysis can enhance our understanding of complex traits
          and disease etiology.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          which highlights the importance of understanding gene expression
          regulation for complex trait analysis. This insight is crucial for
          developing new therapies; however, a mechanistic approach remains
          elusive due to the complexity and variability associated with gene
          co-expression patterns across different cell types. Consequently,
          current single-gene strategies may miss potential targets for drug
          repurposing.


          In this study, we employed PhenoPLIER – a novel method that clusters
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns in disease states – to
          project genetic associations through gene modules. Our results
          demonstrate significant correlations between diseases and co-expressed
          gene modules in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs while inferring
          mechanisms of action for complex traits.


          Utilizing a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating
          groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, moving functional
          genomics research towards a more mechanistic understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes interact and work together to perform their functions, making it

          In the context of functional genomics, this study addresses a critical
          gap in our understanding of gene expression patterns and their
          association with complex diseases. By identifying co-expressed genes
          that influence these traits, we can gain valuable insights into
          disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets. Our novel
          approach, PhenoPLIER, clusters genes based on co-expression patterns
          to project genetic associations and repurpose existing drugs. We

          In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics seeks to
          understand gene co-expression and its role in complex traits. Although
          numerous drug repurposing efforts have been undertaken, a
          comprehensive approach for predicting therapeutic targets remains
          elusive. Our study addresses this gap by developing PhenoPLIER, a
          novel method capable of contextualizing genetic associations and
          revealing potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
          analyzing disease etiology and drug mechanisms using gene expression
          patterns, our work highlights the importance of integrating groups of
          co-expressed genes to elucidate complex traits. The results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we uncover functional players in lipid regulation using
          a CRISPR screen, highlighting the utility of our approach for future
          therapeutic development. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a significant
          contribution to the field by integrating genetic studies with
          functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts, offering new
          insights into complex traits and potential therapeutic targets.

          Genes collaborate in complex processes to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes influence traits requires a deep dive
          into expression regulation across different conditions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions are essential for understanding origin and
          progression of complex diseases. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER - an innovative computational approach designed to map
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. This model
          is based on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns in
          relevant cell types that are significantly associated with disease
          states. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of
          action, as well as prioritizing functionally important players within
          trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.

          repurposing opportunities, which has remained largely unexplored
          (gap). Our novel method, PhenoPLIER, addresses this issue by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach relies
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant
          cell types to identify disease-associated gene networks and drug
          repurposing targets.


          We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizing
          CRISPR screening candidates involved in lipid regulation. Our findings
          highlight that functional players in trait-associated modules are
          underrepresented but essential for phenotypic outcomes, demonstrating
          the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying novel therapeutic targets
          (broader significance).

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Gene functions are orchestrated by interacting genes in specific
          contexts, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions for complex trait determination.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in disease etiology and
          progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method to map
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our results reveal
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, while our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of complex traits, but
          functional genomics provides a deeper insight into gene expression
          regulation across different conditions. By analyzing gene
          co-expression patterns, we can uncover the mechanistic relationships
          between genes and their influence on disease etiology. This approach
          has significant implications for drug repurposing, as it allows us to
          identify therapeutic targets based on shared gene functions.


          However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in complex trait development and progression. To address
          this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational method
          designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across relevant conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies
          disease-associated gene modules that can be accurately predicted in
          known drug-disease pairs and contribute to the understanding of
          mechanisms of action.


          Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our approach through its
          ability to prioritize functionally important players lacking
          associations but found within trait-associated modules. These findings
          highlight the importance of PhenoPLIER in projecting genetic
          associations by elucidating disease etiology and providing insights
          into drug mechanism.

          Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of complex
          traits, yet the mechanistic underpinnings of gene co-expression remain
          elusive. Functional genomics offers a promising approach to bridge
          this gap; however, existing methods fail to capture the full spectrum
          of intergenic interactions. To address this critical need, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          transcriptomic data and pharmacological perturbation information into
          a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our work highlights
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms by mapping gene-trait
          associations and identifying relevant cell types associated with
          diseases. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and uncovers functional players prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. Finally, we validate PhenoPLIER using a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation and demonstrate its potential for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. Overall, these
          findings not only expand our knowledge of complex traits but also
          provide valuable insights into the development of new therapies.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions collectively. To

          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapeutic
          approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in
          identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions

          Complex genetic traits and diseases have long been challenging to
          investigate due to the intricate interplay of genes in concert. Recent
          advances in transcriptomics reveal critical insights into gene
          expression regulation, but a mechanistic understanding remains
          elusive. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation
          for joint analysis based on modules of similar expression patterns
          across conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action through the
          identification of functionally important players lacking associations
          but prioritized within trait-associated modules. Additionally, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we highlight that
          PhenoPLIER's predictions align with disease etiology and potential
          therapeutic targets. These findings underscore the importance of this
          approach for drug repurposing and uncovering the underlying mechanisms
          driving complex traits.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes collaborate in concert to perform their functions, and
          understanding how they contribute to complex traits requires a
          comprehensive investigation of expression regulation across different
          contexts. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms; however, modern
          models predict that gene interactions play a central role in disease
          etiology and progression.


          PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, revealing significant correlations between
          diseases and these cell-type-specific modules. Our method demonstrates
          high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action.


          To further validate PhenoPLIER's utility, we conducted a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally critical
          players are not associated with traits but are prioritized within
          trait-associated gene modules. These findings underscore the
          importance of integrating gene expression patterns for understanding
          disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the

              Genetic studies have traditionally focused on the role of
              individual genes in complex traits. However, recent advances in
              functional genomics and transcriptome-wide association studies
              suggest that gene co-expression plays a crucial role in disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. To gain insight into these
              interactions, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions to project genetic associations and
              predict potential therapeutic targets.


              Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, we utilize a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, revealing functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated
              modules. In conclusion, our approach contextualizes genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially
              uncovering novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.

              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding gene expression
              patterns is crucial for elucidating complex traits and developing
              novel therapeutic strategies. Despite significant advances in
              transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), a comprehensive
              mechanistic explanation remains elusive due to the role of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. The current gap in
              literature highlights the need for a more integrated approach that
              considers co-expression patterns among genes, such as PhenoPLIER.


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational method designed to map genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation, utilizing gene modules with similar
              expression profiles across specific conditions. Our findings
              demonstrate significant correlations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy
              of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              identifying mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate
              PhenoPLIER using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, revealing
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes through
              the use of gene modules provides a novel framework to interpret
              genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. By contextualizing genetic associations
              using this approach, we contribute to advancing drug repurposing
              efforts and enhancing our understanding of complex trait origins.

              Genes function in concert with one another to perform their

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, reveals the context of
              genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed groups of
              genes. The method allows accurate prediction of known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action in complex traits. Moreover,
              through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover

              trait-associated modules, emphasizing PhenoPLIER's potential for

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, it is
              increasingly recognized that understanding gene expression
              patterns across different conditions is essential for determining
              how genes contribute to complex traits. Despite advances in
              transcriptome-wide association studies, a mechanistic
              understanding of these interactions remains crucial for developing
              new therapies. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a significant role in the origin and progression of diseases.


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced in this
              study, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By utilizing modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across relevant cell types, we found that diseases are
              significantly associated with these modules, accurately predicting
              known drug-disease pairs, and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally important players lack associations
              but are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this study's novel approach
              contextualizes genetic associations through the analysis of
              co-expressed genes and reveals potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. By utilizing the power of gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER provides a valuable framework for interpreting complex
              genetic traits and moving forward in drug repurposing efforts.

              Genes function in concert with each other, contributing to complex
              traits. To understand their influence on these traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression across diverse
              conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however,
              modern models predict that interactions between genes play a
              critical role in diseases' origin and progression.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of
              our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, we utilize a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, discovering that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating gene co-expression groups
              through the PhenoPLIER approach provides context for genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This framework offers a novel interpretation of
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In the study of complex traits, genes collaborate and interact
              within specific contexts to perform their functions. A mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation across various
              conditions is essential for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insight into
              individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, but modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and
              our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screening to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through the lens of
              gene modules can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
              framework provided by PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of
              complex traits and could be applied to drug repurposing efforts

              "broader significance").

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that
              harnesses gene expression patterns and pharmacological
              perturbation data to elucidate genetic associations for complex
              traits. The study of genes in concert with each other is crucial
              for understanding their functions in diverse contexts. This
              approach has implications for drug repurposing by identifying
              molecular targets associated with various diseases.


              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, but recent insights
              from systems biology suggest that the role of gene interactions
              cannot be ignored. PhenoPLIER's innovative technique represents
              genes based on their co-expression patterns across identical
              conditions, providing insight into the interplay between various
              cell types and contributing to understanding complex traits.


              Our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease
              associations, offering valuable insights into disease etiology.
              Further investigation of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen
              demonstrates that functionally important players are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This method allows for
              contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers an invaluable tool to interpret
              genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns,
              providing a novel framework for identifying therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing opportunities in various diseases.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that
              harnesses gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation
              information to map genetic trait associations into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By exploring the interplay of
              genes in concert with each other across various contexts, we gain
              valuable insights into complex traits' molecular mechanisms,
              crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in
              disease mechanisms; however, modern theories suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a central role in disease origin and
              progression.


              PhenoPLIER employs modules of co-expressed genes with similar
              expression patterns across shared conditions to elucidate
              associations between diseases and specific cell types. Our
              approach effectively identifies known drug-disease pairs and
              accurately predicts their underlying mechanisms, thereby offering
              valuable guidance for therapeutic strategies. Utilizing a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important players lack significant associations but
              are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes
              to contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework
              provides a novel interpretation of complex genetic traits through
              the lens of gene expression patterns and gene modules.

              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

              In this study, we address a critical gap in the literature by
              introducing PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The
              discovery of complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across different conditions, where genes
              act in concert to perform their functions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's novel method leverages modules of
              co-expressed genes across relevant cell types to map significant
              associations with diseases. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers the underlying mechanisms for
              treatment success. Additionally, we validate our findings using a
              CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, demonstrating that
              functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
              gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. This study presents a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which has broader implications in drug repurposing and
              understanding disease etiology.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool designed to integrate
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By recognizing
              that genes collaborate together in specific contexts to perform
              their functions, we emphasize the importance of understanding
              expression regulation across diverse conditions when determining
              complex trait influence. This insight is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              identified individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms;
              however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              critical role in disease etiology and progression.


              PhenoPLIER constructs modules of genes with shared expression
              patterns across relevant conditions, revealing significant
              associations between diseases and specific cell type-specific gene
              modules. The method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and elucidates mechanisms of action for therapeutic targets.
              Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct
              associations. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential
              drug repurposing opportunities missed through single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations via gene module analysis.

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, addresses the gap in our
              understanding of complex trait mechanisms by elucidating the
              concerted action of genes in specific contexts. Our study focuses
              on co-expression patterns among genes to reveal mechanistic
              insights into disease etiology and therapeutic targets. By
              identifying gene modules with similar expression patterns across
              relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant associations
              between diseases and these gene clusters while accurately
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights the
              prioritization of functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this novel
              framework contextualizes genetic associations through co-expressed
              genes, offering a promising approach to identifying potential
              therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs. By doing so, PhenoPLIER
              significantly contributes to advancing our understanding of
              complex traits and drug mechanisms.

              determining the impact of complex traits. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have previously revealed individual gene roles
              in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play an essential part in disease etiology.
              PhenoPLIER's approach derives from modules of genes exhibiting
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our study
              reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed within relevant cell types, accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally critical players are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite
              lacking direct associations. In conclusion, integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and unearth potential targets missed by single-gene
              approaches. By utilizing gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations, offering valuable
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              This study fills a gap in our understanding of genetic
              associations by projecting gene expression patterns into
              functional genomic contexts. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data to map these complex
              interactions onto common latent representations for joint
              analysis. By examining the co-expression of genes across different
              conditions, we gain insight into their mechanistic roles in
              influencing complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for
              developing new therapies. However, recent models predict a
              significant role for gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              and progression.


              PhenoPLIER represents these interactions by clustering similar
              expression patterns among genes with the same conditions. Our
              analysis reveals strong associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, we accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of
              action through this approach. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
              to study lipid regulation, we identify functionally important
              players that lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER
              in trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes with
              PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic
              associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. This study provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through gene modules,
              highlighting their importance in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              Genes interact and work together to perform their functions in
              specific contexts, making it crucial to understand gene expression
              regulation across various conditions for determining complex trait
              influences. It has been shown that this insight is essential for
              developing novel therapies. In our study, we found a significant
              association between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing
              CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              necessitating a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across various conditions for determining complex
              traits' influence. This insight is crucial for developing novel
              therapies. In this study, we found that diseases are significantly
              associated with cell-type-specific gene modules expressed and our
              method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important
              players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the potential for
              contextualizing genetic associations through gene module
              co-expression using PhenoPLIER, which provides a novel framework
              for interpreting these associations and revealing missed targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.

              The study addresses a critical gap in the literature, as genetic
              studies are limited by their inability to fully capture complex
              traits through single-gene approaches. The research presents a
              novel method called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to project genetic associations and elucidate disease
              etiology. By integrating this approach with functional genomics
              tools like CRISPR screens, the study uncovers potential
              therapeutic targets for drug repurposing in previously untapped
              areas of biological knowledge. In conclusion, by contextualizing
              genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER contributes
              a novel framework for interpreting complex traits and identifying
              new targets missed by single-gene strategies, potentially
              revolutionizing the field of functional genomics and therapeutic
              drug development.

              Genes operate in concert with one another, playing pivotal roles
              within specific contexts to fulfill their functions. To comprehend
              the intricate interplay of genes and understand how they
              contribute to complex traits, it is crucial to analyze gene
              expression regulation across diverse conditions. This
              understanding has proven vital for developing novel therapeutic
              approaches. Our research presents a significant breakthrough by
              demonstrating that diseases exhibit strong associations with
              cell-type-specific gene modules, accurately predicting known
              drug-disease relationships, and elucidating their underlying
              mechanisms of action.


              Using CRISPR screening to study lipid regulation, we found that
              key players in this biological process lack associations but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              findings emphasize the utility of incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes as a context for interpreting genetic
              associations and unveiling potential therapeutic targets missed
              through traditional single-gene strategies. The novel framework
              provided by PhenoPLIER offers an innovative approach to
              interpreting genetic data, highlighting how gene module analysis
              can enhance our understanding of complex traits and disease
              etiology.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              which highlights the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation for complex trait analysis. This insight is crucial for
              developing new therapies; however, a mechanistic approach remains
              elusive due to the complexity and variability associated with gene
              co-expression patterns across different cell types. Consequently,
              current single-gene strategies may miss potential targets for drug
              repurposing.


              In this study, we employed PhenoPLIER – a novel method that
              clusters genes exhibiting similar expression patterns in disease
              states – to project genetic associations through gene modules. Our
              results demonstrate significant correlations between diseases and
              co-expressed gene modules in relevant cell types. Moreover, our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs while
              inferring mechanisms of action for complex traits.

              associations and unveiling potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This approach can aid in developing new therapeutic

              In the context of functional genomics, this study addresses a
              critical gap in our understanding of gene expression patterns and
              their association with complex diseases. By identifying
              co-expressed genes that influence these traits, we can gain
              valuable insights into disease etiology and potential therapeutic
              targets. Our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, clusters genes based on
              co-expression patterns to project genetic associations and
              repurpose existing drugs. We demonstrate the accuracy of this
              method in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen reveals
              functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated
              modules despite lacking associations. In conclusion, by
              integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers novel targets for
              drug repurposing, providing a valuable framework for interpreting
              genetic data.

              Genes function in concert to perform their functions,
              necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions for complex trait analysis. Our study
              highlights the significant association between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, analyzing lipid regulation via CRISPR screens reveals
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.
              Integrating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER provides
              a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and

              conclusion, the use of gene co-expression patterns in complex
              diseases not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology
              but also facilitates drug repurposing and target identification.

              In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics seeks to
              understand gene co-expression and its role in complex traits.
              Although numerous drug repurposing efforts have been undertaken, a
              comprehensive approach for predicting therapeutic targets remains
              elusive. Our study addresses this gap by developing PhenoPLIER, a
              novel method capable of contextualizing genetic associations and
              revealing potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              By analyzing disease etiology and drug mechanisms using gene
              expression patterns, our work highlights the importance of
              integrating groups of co-expressed genes to elucidate complex
              traits. The results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we uncover
              functional players in lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen,
              highlighting the utility of our approach for future therapeutic
              development. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a significant

              functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts, offering new
              insights into complex traits and potential therapeutic targets.

              Genes collaborate in complex processes to perform their functions,
              and understanding how these genes influence traits requires a deep
              dive into expression regulation across different conditions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions are essential for
              understanding origin and progression of complex diseases. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - an innovative computational
              approach designed to map gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation suitable for joint analysis. This model is based on
              modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns in
              relevant cell types that are significantly associated with disease
              states. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of

              within trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation.

              This study aims to bridge the gap in our understanding of complex
              traits and their underlying genetic mechanisms by utilizing
              functional genomics approaches. The context is characterized by
              the role of gene co-expression patterns in predicting disease
              etiology and drug repurposing opportunities, which has remained
              largely unexplored (gap). Our novel method, PhenoPLIER, addresses
              this issue by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach relies on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across relevant cell types to identify
              disease-associated gene networks and drug repurposing targets.


              We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and
              prioritizing CRISPR screening candidates involved in lipid
              regulation. Our findings highlight that functional players in
              trait-associated modules are underrepresented but essential for
              phenotypic outcomes, demonstrating the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying novel therapeutic targets (broader significance).

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Gene functions are orchestrated by interacting genes in specific
              contexts, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across various conditions for complex trait
              determination. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms;
              however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              vital part in disease etiology and progression. Here we present

              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, while our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we find that functionally important players are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct

              Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of complex traits,
              but functional genomics provides a deeper insight into gene
              expression regulation across different conditions. By analyzing
              gene co-expression patterns, we can uncover the mechanistic
              relationships between genes and their influence on disease
              etiology. This approach has significant implications for drug
              repurposing, as it allows us to identify therapeutic targets based
              on shared gene functions.


              However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in complex trait development and progression. To
              address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel
              computational method designed to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions,
              PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules that can be
              accurately predicted in known drug-disease pairs and contribute to
              the understanding of mechanisms of action.


              Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our approach through its
              ability to prioritize functionally important players lacking
              associations but found within trait-associated modules. These
              findings highlight the importance of PhenoPLIER in projecting
              genetic associations by elucidating disease etiology and providing
              insights into drug mechanism.

              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

              PhenoPLIER.

              Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of complex
              traits, yet the mechanistic underpinnings of gene co-expression
              remain elusive. Functional genomics offers a promising approach to
              bridge this gap; however, existing methods fail to capture the
              full spectrum of intergenic interactions. To address this critical
              need, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates transcriptomic data and pharmacological perturbation
              information into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our work highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms
              by mapping gene-trait associations and identifying relevant cell
              types associated with diseases. Moreover, our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers functional players
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Finally, we validate
              PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation and
              demonstrate its potential for therapeutic target identification
              and drug repurposing. Overall, these findings not only expand our
              knowledge of complex traits but also provide valuable insights
              into the development of new therapies.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions collectively. To
              comprehend how these genes contribute to complex traits, we
              require a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
              across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for
              developing new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have aided in identifying the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in
              the origin and progression of complex diseases.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across similar conditions, allowing us to
              identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms more effectively.
              Our findings suggest that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs as well as the
              mechanisms behind their therapeutic actions.


              Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen,
              we found that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER. These
              findings highlight the potential of our approach to discover novel
              therapeutics and further elucidate the complex relationship
              between genes, diseases, and drug mechanisms.

              Complex genetic traits and diseases have long been challenging to

              Genes collaborate in concert to perform their functions, and
              understanding how they contribute to complex traits requires a
              comprehensive investigation of expression regulation across
              different contexts. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
              on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms;
              however, modern models predict that gene interactions play a
              central role in disease etiology and progression.


              PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing
              significant correlations between diseases and these
              cell-type-specific modules. Our method demonstrates high accuracy
              in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action.


              To further validate PhenoPLIER's utility, we conducted a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
              critical players are not associated with traits but are
              prioritized within trait-associated gene modules. These findings
              underscore the importance of integrating gene expression patterns
              for understanding disease etiology and identifying novel
              therapeutic targets.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
