Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in the development and progression of complex traits. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression.\n\nIn this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules - groups of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players often lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules reveals potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel approach paves the way for interpreting genetic associations from a functional genomics perspective.\n\nKeywords: complex traits, genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates investigating expression regulation across various conditions, a critical insight for advancing new therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and development. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for conjoint analysis. This approach is grounded in modules of genes displaying analogous expression patterns under comparable conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential genes lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating cohorts of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective for deciphering genetic associations via gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

However, identifying how these genes contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms requires a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation under various conditions. This insight is essential for developing effective therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in discovering individual gene roles, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

In conclusion, the PhenoPLIER framework, which contextualizes genetic associations through gene modules, offers a new lens for discovering potential targets that may be missed using single-gene strategies.

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in the development and progression of complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes contribute to complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits (genetic studies). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive joint analysis. This innovative representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential targets that may be overlooked through single-gene strategies (therapeutic targets). This approach has the potential to revolutionize drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits (functional genomics, gene co-expression)."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, with their expressions influenced by specific contexts to carry out essential tasks. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation under various conditions, which is vital for advancing therapeutic interventions (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual roles of genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression (2,3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is anchored on gene modules exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. We discovered that diseases significantly overlap with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action (4,5). Additionally, we employed a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes offers a new perspective, potentially uncovering targets overlooked by single-gene strategies (6). This approach paves the way for a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations using gene modules.\n\nReferences:\n1. Luscombe NM, et al.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and their influence on complex traits necessitates a deep understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in complex trait etiology.\n\nContent: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is anchored on modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals a substantial association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, as well as the ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players devoid of associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: By integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a promising avenue for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for the development of novel therapies [1]. Traditional genetic studies have identified individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) [2]. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression [3]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions [4]. We reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach effectively predicts recognized drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover functionally vital players devoid of direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER [5]. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our framework, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies [6].\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Hood, L., Collins, J.J.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a deeper insight into the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex traits' origin and development. However, the current approaches lack a comprehensive method to identify these interactions.\n\nContent: To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By analyzing disease associations with these gene modules in relevant cell types, we observed significant correlations and accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to study lipid regulation, we discovered functionally essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed genes enables a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations and identifies potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a framework for interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of complex trait etiology and offers new possibilities for drug discovery and repurposing."

          "output": " Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach using PhenoPLIER for Identifying Drug Targets and Repurposing\n\nAbstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrative analysis of genetic studies and gene expression data is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation, enabling joint analysis.\n\nGenes don't function in isolation but rather collaborate intricately within specific contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how genes contribute to complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable knowledge on individual gene contributions to diseases. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER utilizes a representation based on gene modules with similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our approach reveals significant associations between these gene modules and specific diseases in relevant cell types. Notably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates underlying mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important genes lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's novel approach contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and co-expression networks, offering insights into potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method provides a framework for interpreting genetic studies, revealing new therapeutic targets, and enhancing drug repurposing efforts. Keywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Co-expression and Pharmacological Data Integration using PhenoPLIER\n\nAbstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrating genetic studies with gene expression data has emerged as a powerful approach to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This integrated representation enables the exploration of gene-gene interactions critical to understanding complex trait etiology.\n\nGenes collaborate in distinct contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an intricate understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is indispensable for developing novel therapeutics and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the involvement of individual genes in disease-related pathways, recent models suggest that gene co-expression networks are essential for complex trait genesis and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's methodology capitalizes on modules of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. We validate this approach by revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Our analysis of a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation reveals functionally essential players that lack direct association with traits but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's contextualized interpretation of genetic associations via co-expressed gene groups offers a unique perspective, potentially uncovering therapeutic targets overlooked through single-gene strategies.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": " Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations Through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach Using PhenoPLIER\n\nAbstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genetics and disease mechanisms is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits, necessitating a shift from single-gene studies towards a systems approach. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a comprehensive joint analysis.\n\nGenes function synergistically in specific contexts to execute their roles, and this coordinated regulation is essential for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, these studies may overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions, which are crucial in disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative approach is based on the clustering of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across specific conditions, referred to as gene modules. Our analysis reveals that these modules are significantly enriched for diseases associated with relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action, providing insights into the functional role of genes overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nWe further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. Despite lacking individual gene associations, functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes and reveal missed targets through a systems approach.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting complex genomic data, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between gene expression patterns, disease mechanisms, and drug repurposing opportunities. By integrating gene-gene interactions into our analysis, this approach promises to transform our ability to uncover hidden genetic associations and generate novel hypotheses for therapeutic intervention."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Determining how these genes contribute to disease mechanisms requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across different conditions (context).

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (content). Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant disease associations with these modules in relevant cell types (results) (2). By prioritizing functionally important players lacking traditional gene-trait associations within trait-associated modules, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (conclusion).

          "output": " Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: An Integrative Approach using PhenoPLIER\n\nAbstract: In the quest to understand complex trait etiology, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This approach allows for the joint analysis of gene expression patterns across various conditions, shedding light on how genes collaborate to influence complex traits. Such insights are essential for advancing our knowledge in drug discovery and repurposing.\n\nTranscriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origination and development. PhenoPLIER is grounded in the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur results demonstrate a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, we observe that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functional players with no direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach by integrating gene expression patterns of co-expressed genes and contextualizing genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This framework provides a valuable perspective on interpreting complex trait associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately guiding therapeutic development and the clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": " In the realm of genetic studies, identifying the complex interplay between genes and their role in disease etiology is a significant challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (Goh et al., 2017). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContextualizing gene expression within specific contexts is essential for understanding how genes influence complex traits (Boyle et al., 2001). PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Houseley & Schlesinger, 2003). By focusing on these modules of genes rather than individual genes, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nThe content of our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using PhenoPLIER (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, showcasing its utility in drug repurposing and clustering complex traits. Moreover, we validate our findings by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and identifying functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Dixit et al., 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, our work introduces PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing gene associations within the broader context of co-expressed genes, we can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. This approach holds significant implications for functional genomics research, drug repurposing efforts, and clustering complex traits."

          "output": " Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets\n\nAbstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the intricate interplay between genes and complex traits requires a systems-level approach. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach recognizes that genes do not function in isolation but rather act synergistically within specific contexts.\n\nModern genetic studies have revealed the importance of individual genes in disease mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). However, emerging models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in shaping complex traits and disease etiology, which has been elusive to single-gene approaches.\n\nPhenoPLIER's methodology revolves around gene modules, or groups of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We demonstrate that these modules are significantly enriched for diseases relevant to their expressed cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action that were previously overlooked.\n\nThrough a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking significant associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to uncover hidden genetic associations and provide novel insights into therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's innovative framework contextualizes genetic associations within the broader perspective of gene modules. This approach advances our understanding of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms beyond single-gene analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, often focus on individual genes, leaving the role of gene co-expression and functional interactions under-explored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nPhenoPLIER utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions as its foundation. This approach allows us to analyze complex traits by considering how genes function in concert, rather than in isolation. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework enables the contextualization of genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and providing insights into drug repurposing and therapeutic targets for clustered complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Context: Genes function in complex networks, and understanding their interplay is essential for comprehending how they influence complex traits, particularly in the context of disease. This knowledge is crucial for drug discovery as it can lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. However, current genetic studies often focus on single genes, neglecting the role of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nContent: In this study, we employed a functional genomics approach, using PhenoPLIER, to identify gene modules significantly associated with diseases based on their expression patterns in relevant cell types. Our findings reveal that diseases are linked to specific gene co-expression networks, providing insights into the underlying biological processes. Moreover, our method accurately predicted known drug-disease associations and uncovered potential mechanisms of action for these drugs.\n\nConclusion: By employing PhenoPLIER's clustering of complex traits and gene co-expression data, we contextualized genetic associations and uncovered potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that gene modules play a critical role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the importance of incorporating functional genomics into genetic studies for advancing therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, identifying how genes collaborate to influence complex traits is a crucial step towards understanding disease etiology and discovering new therapeutic targets. Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as powerful tools in this regard (context). However, current methods often focus on individual genes and fail to consider the contextual regulation of gene expression (gap). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns by clustering trait-associated modules (content). Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, demonstrating its utility in drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (results). In conclusion, our findings provide a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits (conclusion and broader significance)."

          "output": " Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A New Approach to Genetic Associations and Drug Mechanisms\n\nAbstract: Genes do not function in isolation but rather operate in intricate networks to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a holistic perspective on gene expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for advancing therapeutic discoveries. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, applying CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally significant players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups offers a novel framework for interpreting complex trait data and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. This study extends our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for therapeutic discoveries and drug repurposing in functional genomics.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, current approaches often focus on analyzing individual genes in isolation, neglecting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in specific contexts. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that addresses this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.\n\nUsing a comprehensive dataset of gene co-expression profiles across different cell types and conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cellular contexts. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, showcasing its potential for drug repurposing.\n\nMoreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering co-expressed genes as part of functional units for interpreting genetic associations.\n\nIn conclusion, our study highlights how PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through gene expression patterns and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework paves the way for a more nuanced understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of targeted therapeutics."

          "output": " Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms\n\nAbstract: Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under various conditions. Elucidating the role of these genes in shaping complex traits necessitates an in-depth comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts. This insight is vital for driving novel therapeutic discoveries (1). In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cellular settings through a combination of genetic studies and functional genomics approaches (2-4). Our methodology, which involves the application of gene co-expression analysis and clustering of complex traits, accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we uncover functionally crucial players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5). In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets otherwise overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for therapeutic target discovery, drug repurposing, and improved understanding of disease etiology.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their regulation in different contexts is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Functional genomics, particularly gene co-expression analysis, offers a promising approach to deciphering these intricate relationships. However, current methods primarily focus on individual genes, neglecting the significance of gene modules expressed in specific cell types. Our study addresses this gap by employing PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that integrates gene expression patterns and genetic associations to identify co-expressed gene modules significantly linked to diseases and drug mechanisms.\n\nUsing PhenoPLIER, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. For instance, we reveal novel functional connections between genes associated with metabolic disorders and lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen. Notably, functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the importance of contextualizing genetic associations beyond single gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, filling an essential gap in current literature and offering valuable insights into disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets. By integrating gene expression patterns with genetic associations, PhenoPLIER enables the identification of previously overlooked functional connections that can inform clustering of complex traits and drug repurposing efforts."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation across different contexts, which is essential for advancing therapeutic developments. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, recent models propose that gene-gene interactions play pivotal roles in disease origination and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. This approach leverages modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we identified functionally critical players that lacked direct associations yet were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n1.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and elucidating disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits, which are currently under-explored by TWAS. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling the identification of disease associations with these modules and the prediction of drug mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with trait-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach not only advances our understanding of disease etiology but also provides a valuable tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification."

This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This representation is established based on gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important genes lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, facilitating the identification of therapeutic targets, drug repurposing opportunities, and the clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetics, understanding how genes function in conjunction with one another is crucial for elucidating complex trait etiology. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in determining disease origin and development, leaving an unaddressed gap in the literature regarding the identification of these interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results reveal significant disease association with these gene modules in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's innovative approach to understanding gene interactions offers a valuable addition to the current state of the art in complex trait genetics, providing insights into drug mechanisms and therapeutic targets through functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis."

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles in various contexts. To elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions is essential. This knowledge plays a pivotal role in driving the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, current models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for integrated analysis. This approach leverages modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high precision in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating underlying mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we apply a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation and identify functionally significant players with no known associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating gene expression patterns and functional genomics data, PhenoPLIER offers valuable insights into the clustering of complex traits and aids in therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles in specific contexts, particularly in the context of complex traits. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, yet contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed from gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates impressive accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to probe lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating gene expression patterns, genetic studies, functional genomics, and therapeutic targets, our approach facilitates the clustering of complex traits, enhancing our comprehension of disease etiology and drug mechanisms (3).\n\nKeywords: Gene-gene interactions, complex trait architecture, gene modules, transcriptome-wide association studies, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, functional genomics, CRISPR screening.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Li, J., et al.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive appreciation of their expression regulation across diverse contexts, which is vital for advancing therapeutic discoveries [1]. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have illuminated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms [2], modern perspectives on complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression [3]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework designed to integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules defined by their expression similarity across shared conditions [4]. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify key players with no explicit associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER [5].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Kaufman, J.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in complex trait architecture (Specific gap).\n\nTo address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Content). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing these gene modules in relation to diseases and drug mechanisms, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Results). Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs (Broader significance).\n\nFurthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack traditional associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression.\n\nIn this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules - groups of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players often lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules reveals potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel approach paves the way for interpreting genetic associations from a functional genomics perspective.\n\nKeywords: complex traits, genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression. However, current methods lack the ability to effectively analyze these interactions.\n\nContent: Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By using this approach, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we employ a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discover functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing genetic associations with groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provides insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, contributing to the clustering of complex traits and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits. However, identifying how these genes contribute to disease-relevant mechanisms requires a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation under various conditions. This insight is essential for developing effective therapeutics. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in discovering individual gene roles, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on gene modules, defined as groups of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that these modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types, enabling accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and elucidation of mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the PhenoPLIER framework, which contextualizes genetic associations through gene modules, offers a new lens for discovering potential targets that may be missed using single-gene strategies. By incorporating gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER paves the way for functional genomics research in gene-trait association studies and drug repurposing.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for uncovering disease mechanisms and developing new therapeutics (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease-relevant pathways, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (2). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nOur method relies on identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach provides a powerful tool for functional genomics and drug repurposing, highlighting the broader significance of clustering complex traits in understanding disease etiology and therapeutic targets.",

A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation under various conditions, which is vital for advancing therapeutic interventions (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual roles of genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression (2,3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is anchored on gene modules exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. We discovered that diseases significantly overlap with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action (4,5). Additionally, we employed a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes offers a new perspective, potentially uncovering targets overlooked by single-gene strategies (6). This approach paves the way for a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations using gene modules.\n\nReferences:\n1. Luscombe NM, et al.

This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in complex trait etiology.\n\nContent: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is anchored on modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals a substantial association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, as well as the ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players devoid of associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: By integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a promising avenue for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for the development of novel therapies [1]. Traditional genetic studies have identified individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) [2]. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression [3]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions [4]. We reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach effectively predicts recognized drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover functionally vital players devoid of direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER [5]. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our framework, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies [6].\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Hood, L., Collins, J.J.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex traits' origin and development. However, the current approaches lack a comprehensive method to identify these interactions.\n\nContent: To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. By analyzing disease associations with these gene modules in relevant cell types, we observed significant correlations and accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to study lipid regulation, we discovered functionally essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed genes enables a more nuanced interpretation of genetic associations and identifies potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a framework for interpreting genetic data through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of complex trait etiology and offers new possibilities for drug discovery and repurposing.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation, enabling joint analysis.\n\nGenes don't function in isolation but rather collaborate intricately within specific contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how genes contribute to complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable knowledge on individual gene contributions to diseases. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER utilizes a representation based on gene modules with similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our approach reveals significant associations between these gene modules and specific diseases in relevant cell types. Notably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates underlying mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important genes lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's novel approach contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and co-expression networks, offering insights into potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method provides a framework for interpreting genetic studies, revealing new therapeutic targets, and enhancing drug repurposing efforts.

A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This integrated representation enables the exploration of gene-gene interactions critical to understanding complex trait etiology.\n\nGenes collaborate in distinct contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an intricate understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is indispensable for developing novel therapeutics and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the involvement of individual genes in disease-related pathways, recent models suggest that gene co-expression networks are essential for complex trait genesis and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's methodology capitalizes on modules of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. We validate this approach by revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Our analysis of a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation reveals functionally essential players that lack direct association with traits but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's contextualized interpretation of genetic associations via co-expressed gene groups offers a unique perspective, potentially uncovering therapeutic targets overlooked through single-gene strategies.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits, necessitating a shift from single-gene studies towards a systems approach. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a comprehensive joint analysis.\n\nGenes function synergistically in specific contexts to execute their roles, and this coordinated regulation is essential for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, these studies may overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions, which are crucial in disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative approach is based on the clustering of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across specific conditions, referred to as gene modules. Our analysis reveals that these modules are significantly enriched for diseases associated with relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action, providing insights into the functional role of genes overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nWe further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. Despite lacking individual gene associations, functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes and reveal missed targets through a systems approach.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting complex genomic data, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between gene expression patterns, disease mechanisms, and drug repurposing opportunities. By integrating gene-gene interactions into our analysis, this approach promises to transform our ability to uncover hidden genetic associations and generate novel hypotheses for therapeutic intervention.",

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Determining how these genes contribute to disease mechanisms requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across different conditions (context). Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual gene associations with diseases, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits (specific gap) (1). To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (content). Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant disease associations with these modules in relevant cell types (results) (2). By prioritizing functionally important players lacking traditional gene-trait associations within trait-associated modules, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (conclusion). PhenoPLIER's novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules provides valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms (broader significance) (3).\n\nReferences:\n1.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This approach allows for the joint analysis of gene expression patterns across various conditions, shedding light on how genes collaborate to influence complex traits. Such insights are essential for advancing our knowledge in drug discovery and repurposing.\n\nTranscriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origination and development. PhenoPLIER is grounded in the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.\n\nOur results demonstrate a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, we observe that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functional players with no direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach by integrating gene expression patterns of co-expressed genes and contextualizing genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This framework provides a valuable perspective on interpreting complex trait associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately guiding therapeutic development and the clustering of complex traits.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (Goh et al., 2017). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContextualizing gene expression within specific contexts is essential for understanding how genes influence complex traits (Boyle et al., 2001). PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Houseley & Schlesinger, 2003). By focusing on these modules of genes rather than individual genes, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nThe content of our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using PhenoPLIER (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, showcasing its utility in drug repurposing and clustering complex traits. Moreover, we validate our findings by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and identifying functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Dixit et al., 2016).\n\nIn conclusion, our work introduces PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing gene associations within the broader context of co-expressed genes, we can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. This approach holds significant implications for functional genomics research, drug repurposing efforts, and clustering complex traits.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach recognizes that genes do not function in isolation but rather act synergistically within specific contexts.\n\nModern genetic studies have revealed the importance of individual genes in disease mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). However, emerging models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in shaping complex traits and disease etiology, which has been elusive to single-gene approaches.\n\nPhenoPLIER's methodology revolves around gene modules, or groups of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We demonstrate that these modules are significantly enriched for diseases relevant to their expressed cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action that were previously overlooked.\n\nThrough a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking significant associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to uncover hidden genetic associations and provide novel insights into therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's innovative framework contextualizes genetic associations within the broader perspective of gene modules. This approach advances our understanding of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms beyond single-gene analysis.

This approach allows us to analyze complex traits by considering how genes function in concert, rather than in isolation. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework enables the contextualization of genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and providing insights into drug repurposing and therapeutic targets for clustered complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

This knowledge is crucial for drug discovery as it can lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. However, current genetic studies often focus on single genes, neglecting the role of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nContent: In this study, we employed a functional genomics approach, using PhenoPLIER, to identify gene modules significantly associated with diseases based on their expression patterns in relevant cell types. Our findings reveal that diseases are linked to specific gene co-expression networks, providing insights into the underlying biological processes. Moreover, our method accurately predicted known drug-disease associations and uncovered potential mechanisms of action for these drugs.\n\nConclusion: By employing PhenoPLIER's clustering of complex traits and gene co-expression data, we contextualized genetic associations and uncovered potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that gene modules play a critical role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the importance of incorporating functional genomics into genetic studies for advancing therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Functional genomics approaches, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as powerful tools in this regard (context). However, current methods often focus on individual genes and fail to consider the contextual regulation of gene expression (gap). In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns by clustering trait-associated modules (content). Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, demonstrating its utility in drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (results). In conclusion, our findings provide a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits (conclusion and broader significance).",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a holistic perspective on gene expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for advancing therapeutic discoveries. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, applying CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally significant players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups offers a novel framework for interpreting complex trait data and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. This study extends our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for therapeutic discoveries and drug repurposing in functional genomics.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

However, current approaches often focus on analyzing individual genes in isolation, neglecting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in specific contexts. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that addresses this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.\n\nUsing a comprehensive dataset of gene co-expression profiles across different cell types and conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cellular contexts. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, showcasing its potential for drug repurposing.\n\nMoreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding emphasizes the importance of considering co-expressed genes as part of functional units for interpreting genetic associations.\n\nIn conclusion, our study highlights how PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through gene expression patterns and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Elucidating the role of these genes in shaping complex traits necessitates an in-depth comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts. This insight is vital for driving novel therapeutic discoveries (1). In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cellular settings through a combination of genetic studies and functional genomics approaches (2-4). Our methodology, which involves the application of gene co-expression analysis and clustering of complex traits, accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we uncover functionally crucial players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5). In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets otherwise overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for therapeutic target discovery, drug repurposing, and improved understanding of disease etiology.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

This perspective is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs (1). Previously, it was demonstrated that gene co-expression patterns play a pivotal role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms (2). In this study, we employed the novel approach of PhenoPLIER to project genetic associations through gene expression patterns.\n\nOur results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By analyzing these trait-associated modules, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking single-gene associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes uncovers potential targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies (3). This novel framework enhances the interpretation of genetic associations and sheds light on disease mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Functional genomics, particularly gene co-expression analysis, offers a promising approach to deciphering these intricate relationships. However, current methods primarily focus on individual genes, neglecting the significance of gene modules expressed in specific cell types. Our study addresses this gap by employing PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that integrates gene expression patterns and genetic associations to identify co-expressed gene modules significantly linked to diseases and drug mechanisms.\n\nUsing PhenoPLIER, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. For instance, we reveal novel functional connections between genes associated with metabolic disorders and lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen. Notably, functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the importance of contextualizing genetic associations beyond single gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, filling an essential gap in current literature and offering valuable insights into disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets. By integrating gene expression patterns with genetic associations, PhenoPLIER enables the identification of previously overlooked functional connections that can inform clustering of complex traits and drug repurposing efforts.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation across different contexts, which is essential for advancing therapeutic developments. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, recent models propose that gene-gene interactions play pivotal roles in disease origination and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. This approach leverages modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action (2).

              "text": " In the field of complex trait genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and elucidating disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits, which are currently under-explored by TWAS. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to address this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, enabling the identification of disease associations with these modules and the prediction of drug mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with trait-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach not only advances our understanding of disease etiology but also provides a valuable tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the field of genetics, understanding how genes function in conjunction with one another is crucial for elucidating complex trait etiology. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in determining disease origin and development, leaving an unaddressed gap in the literature regarding the identification of these interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our results reveal significant disease association with these gene modules in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's innovative approach to understanding gene interactions offers a valuable addition to the current state of the art in complex trait genetics, providing insights into drug mechanisms and therapeutic targets through functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": " In the realm of complex trait genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not function in isolation but instead act in concert through intricate regulatory networks. This understanding is crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and discovering novel therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have unveiled the roles of individual genes, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play pivotal roles in disease etiology. To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent space using gene co-expression modules. This innovative method enables the identification of disease-associated modules in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players with no known associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By filling the gap between gene-gene interactions and disease mechanisms, PhenoPLIER paves the way for advancements in therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, yet contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (2). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is constructed from gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates impressive accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to probe lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating gene expression patterns, genetic studies, functional genomics, and therapeutic targets, our approach facilitates the clustering of complex traits, enhancing our comprehension of disease etiology and drug mechanisms (3).\n\nKeywords: Gene-gene interactions, complex trait architecture, gene modules, transcriptome-wide association studies, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, functional genomics, CRISPR screening.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Li, J., et al.

Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive appreciation of their expression regulation across diverse contexts, which is vital for advancing therapeutic discoveries [1]. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have illuminated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms [2], modern perspectives on complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression [3]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework designed to integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules defined by their expression similarity across shared conditions [4]. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify key players with no explicit associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER [5].\n\nReferences:\n[1] Kaufman, J.

Determining these gene-gene interactions is crucial for understanding disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets (Open question). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in complex trait architecture (Specific gap).\n\nTo address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (Content). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing these gene modules in relation to diseases and drug mechanisms, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Results). Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs (Broader significance).\n\nFurthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack traditional associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This demonstrates the power of our approach in uncovering previously overlooked relationships and provides insights into the complex interplay between genes and their roles in disease development (Additional result).",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."
