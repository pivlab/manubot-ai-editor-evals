To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players may lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00) Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is essential for the development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the origin and progression of complex traits.

To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
