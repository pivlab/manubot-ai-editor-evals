Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Genes work together in harmony to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a deeper insight into gene expression regulation across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we observe significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. \n\nUsing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations offers a unique perspective on gene module-based drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Genetic studies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits, while functional genomics seeks to understand gene expression patterns across various conditions. Despite significant advances in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations remains elusive due to limited mechanistic insights and insufficient coverage of gene interactions. The current gap is particularly evident when it comes to identifying potential therapeutic targets through the repurposing of existing drugs, as single-gene approaches often overlook crucial co-expression patterns among genes in complex traits.\n\nIn this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, by leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we observed functional importance players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER represents an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene module analysis and holds potential implications not only in drug repurposing but also in elucidating disease etiology and uncovering novel therapeutic targets."

          "output": "Genes are orchestrated to work together in specific contexts, contributing to the performance of their functions. To decipher complex traits and develop novel therapies, it is crucial to gain a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach, harnesses the power of gene co-expression patterns to map associations between traits, pharmacological perturbation data, and common latent representations for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression profiles across relevant cell types, we observed significant disease associations in these gene modules. PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms is impressive, making it a powerful tool to uncover novel therapeutic targets.\n\nA CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed functional players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene modules using the PhenoPLIER approach. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and highlight potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By doing so, this novel framework provides a comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene expression patterns is critical for elucidating complex trait etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, traditional methods may overlook crucial gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By using modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen highlights functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating gene modules with co-expression patterns through PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has broad implications for drug repurposing and furthers our mechanistic understanding of complex trait etiology."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "This study aims to address a gap in the literature by presenting an innovative approach, PhenoPLIER, for projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. By integrating transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data and clustering complex traits based on co-expressed genes, this method can provide a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nThe context is the critical need to bridge the gap between single-gene strategies and functional genomics approaches for interpreting genetic associations in complex diseases. Our approach reveals potential targets missed by traditional methods while simultaneously providing insights into how these genes influence traits across diverse contexts.\n\nPhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation of co-expressed genes, which is derived from modules exhibiting similar expression patterns within the same conditions. This method offers an accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and helps infer mechanisms of action in diseases by identifying gene modules that are significantly associated with specific traits.\n\nOur results demonstrate that this approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets, such as functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation. In conclusion, by incorporating gene co-expression patterns, the novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER enables a more comprehensive understanding of genetic determinants and facilitates drug repurposing strategies for complex diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions is crucial for deciphering complex traits. Current models predict that gene-gene interactions play a central role in disease etiology and progression. However, transcriptome-wide association studies have only begun to uncover individual gene roles, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of the mechanistic underpinnings of expression regulation across diverse conditions.\n\nHere, we introduce PhenoPLIER—a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By modeling genes with similar expression patterns as modules, PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility by using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation—highlighting functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER's predictions.\n\nIn conclusion, the incorporation of co-expressed gene groups through PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and contextualizing complex traits, revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings underscore the importance of analyzing genes in concert with one another to understand disease etiology and identify novel drug mechanisms, thus advancing functional genomics research and contributing to the field's broader scientific landscape."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Our method reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies in drug repurposing and identifies key players involved in disease origin and progression using transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate the importance of PhenoPLIER's approach by finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation. In conclusion, our study fills an essential gap in understanding genetic studies by projecting gene expression patterns and unveiling disease etiology and drug mechanisms using functional genomics."

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics. By mapping gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for complex trait development. Recognizing that genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions, our focus is on understanding how these co-expressed genes influence disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets. \n\nTranscriptome-wide association studies have proven valuable in identifying individual gene roles within disease processes; however, modern models of complex traits predict a significant role for gene-gene interactions in origin and progression. To achieve this mechanistic insight, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, allowing us to observe associations between diseases and these co-expressed genetic elements. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action through the identification of functionally important players within trait-associated gene modules.\n\nTo further validate PhenoPLIER's potential applications, we conducted a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, revealing that key functional components lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. Thus, our method contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately providing insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing. \n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enriching understanding of complex trait development and facilitating targeted therapeutic interventions."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "We introduce PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that translates genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate in concert to perform their functions; thus, understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a deeper insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is instrumental in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play an essential part in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and these cellular-specific gene modules. Our method demonstrates accuracy in predicting well-established drug-disease pairs while also inferring mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that functionally crucial players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack direct associations. In summary, through incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic links and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. This novel framework provides a deeper understanding of complex traits and their associated gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

By harnessing transcriptome-wide association studies, our approach aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how gene functions in concert with other genes within specific contexts, ultimately contributing to disease etiology and therapeutic target identification for various diseases. \n\nPhenoPLIER's primary strength lies in its ability to identify groups of co-expressed genes that have been correlated with complex traits by leveraging modules of similar expression patterns across relevant cell types. This strategy enables us to better predict known drug-disease associations, as well as infer the mechanisms behind these relationships. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, demonstrating how PhenoPLIER effectively identifies functional players and prioritizes them within trait-associated gene modules.\n\nIn summary, by incorporating co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework to interpret genetic associations and uncover novel therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked through traditional single-gene strategies. This approach has significant implications for drug repurposing efforts and can further enhance the mechanistic understanding of complex traits associated with various diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

This approach allows us to study complex traits by considering how genes act in concert with each other under different conditions. \n\nMethod: By analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies, we demonstrate the importance of understanding gene expression regulation in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across relevant cell types and uses them to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their therapeutic mechanisms. We further validate our approach using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation.\n\nResults: Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene expression patterns in specific cell types, validating the utility of our method for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, we find functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules but lacking associations, suggesting they could be valuable candidates for drug repurposing efforts. \n\nConclusion: PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to contextualize genetic associations and uncover undiscovered therapeutic mechanisms by integrating groups of co-expressed genes. This approach has broad implications for understanding disease etiology and developing new therapies in the field of functional genomics."

          "output": "We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes exhibit concerted action with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in identifying individual gene roles in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across shared conditions. We find a strong correlation between diseases and expressed gene modules in relevant cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen for lipid regulation further validates our approach by revealing functionally significant players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and unearth potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of complex traits and therapeutic mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This methodology provides an accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and enhances our mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility through the CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, identifying functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking associations.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, understanding the intricate interplay of genes and their expression patterns in distinct contexts remains a challenge. Our study addresses this gap by developing PhenoPLIER - an innovative approach for predicting drug repurposing targets based on gene co-expression patterns. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific cell types through our analysis of known drug-disease pairs, revealing novel mechanistic insights into therapeutic targets. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we highlight the prioritization of functionally important players in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER - demonstrating its potential for gene co-expression clustering and drug repurposing. In conclusion, our work highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover untapped therapeutic potentials missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, PhenoPLIER advances functional genomics research in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Context: Recent advances in functional genomics have highlighted the importance of gene co-expression patterns for understanding complex traits and disease etiology. However, existing studies often overlook the potential of integrating these patterns to predict drug mechanisms and repurposing opportunities. Consequently, a gap exists in literature addressing the use of gene modules to project genetic associations and elucidate therapeutic targets.\n\nContent: In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach for projecting genetic associations through co-expression patterns among genes involved in complex traits. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our method contextualized disease etiology and identified novel drug repurposing opportunities. We utilized a CRISPR screen to validate our findings on lipid regulation, revealing the potential of PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for predicting therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies.\n\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate that incorporating gene co-expression patterns significantly enhances genetic association projections and uncovers overlooked drug mechanisms and repurposing options in complex diseases. By employing our novel framework, PhenoPLIER, researchers can now more accurately predict the etiology of disease and identify potential therapeutic targets to address a wide range of complex traits."

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

To understand how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge has become essential for developing novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, our results reveal that functionally crucial players lack associations but still appear prioritized within trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's co-expression analysis. In conclusion, incorporating gene modules through the PhenoPLIER approach can contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations sheds light on the role of gene modules in disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

To fully comprehend their roles in determining intricate traits, an understanding of gene expression regulation across various contexts is essential. This knowledge has proven vital for advancing therapeutic advancements by identifying the functional role individual genes play in disease mechanisms.

Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across identical conditions, this method enables the identification of diseases that are strongly associated with specific cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "The context of this paper is the study of genetic associations through gene expression patterns, focusing on disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The gap in current literature is that while transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes involved in disease processes, a mechanistic understanding of gene co-expression across different conditions is essential to develop new therapies. Modern models predict that complex traits are driven by gene-gene interactions.\n\nThe content introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into common latent representations based on genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing diseases associated with specific cell types and predicting known drug-disease pairs accurately, it demonstrates its usefulness in identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.\n\nThe conclusion interprets these findings by showing that PhenoPLIER effectively identifies disease mechanisms and prioritizes functionally important players involved in complex trait regulation. This paper fills a gap in the literature by providing a novel method for understanding gene co-expression patterns, which can be crucial to developing new therapies and drug repurposing strategies."

This innovative method leverages modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, enabling us to project gene-trait relationships with enhanced accuracy. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in disease-relevant cellular contexts, validating our approach's ability to predict known drug-disease associations and elucidate their underlying mechanisms.\n\nFurthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we reveal that functionally important players do not exhibit strong association signals but still emerge as prioritized traits-associated modules identified by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of our method to identify novel therapeutic targets and support drug repurposing strategies in diverse disease contexts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining complex traits, highlighting the importance of understanding gene-gene interactions for disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing methods fail to capture this intricate interplay effectively. Consequently, new therapies often fall short in addressing the root causes of diseases. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By utilizing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, our method effectively projects genetic associations and enables accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilize a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only fills the current gap in literature regarding gene co-expression but also paves the way for drug repurposing strategies based on our findings, ultimately moving the field forward with promising therapeutic targets and insights into disease etiology."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Our study aims to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms through projecting gene expression patterns. The content section presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates transcriptome data with pharmacological perturbation information, enabling the mapping of trait associations onto common latent representations derived from modules exhibiting similar expression profiles across different conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action and identifying functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight a novel perspective on disease etiology and suggest potential avenues for drug repurposing by leveraging gene co-expression patterns."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

We fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs, and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation. These findings have broader implications for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies, highlighting the importance of understanding gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations with complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes' role in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our findings accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting potential therapeutic targets. Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking associations. Overall, this work fills an essential gap in the literature on functional genomics and advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we observe significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. \n\nUsing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations offers a unique perspective on gene module-based drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Despite significant advances in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations remains elusive due to limited mechanistic insights and insufficient coverage of gene interactions. The current gap is particularly evident when it comes to identifying potential therapeutic targets through the repurposing of existing drugs, as single-gene approaches often overlook crucial co-expression patterns among genes in complex traits.\n\nIn this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, by leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we observed functional importance players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the application of PhenoPLIER represents an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene module analysis and holds potential implications not only in drug repurposing but also in elucidating disease etiology and uncovering novel therapeutic targets.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

To decipher complex traits and develop novel therapies, it is crucial to gain a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions.

However, traditional methods may overlook crucial gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By using modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our CRISPR screen highlights functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating gene modules with co-expression patterns through PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has broad implications for drug repurposing and furthers our mechanistic understanding of complex trait etiology.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

By integrating transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data and clustering complex traits based on co-expressed genes, this method can provide a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nThe context is the critical need to bridge the gap between single-gene strategies and functional genomics approaches for interpreting genetic associations in complex diseases. Our approach reveals potential targets missed by traditional methods while simultaneously providing insights into how these genes influence traits across diverse contexts.\n\nPhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation of co-expressed genes, which is derived from modules exhibiting similar expression patterns within the same conditions. This method offers an accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and helps infer mechanisms of action in diseases by identifying gene modules that are significantly associated with specific traits.\n\nOur results demonstrate that this approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets, such as functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation. In conclusion, by incorporating gene co-expression patterns, the novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER enables a more comprehensive understanding of genetic determinants and facilitates drug repurposing strategies for complex diseases.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

By recognizing the concerted actions of genes in specific contexts, our method sheds light on complex traits by elucidating their underlying mechanisms. This insight is crucial for devising novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in disease processes; however, modern models emphasize that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across relevant cellular contexts. We observe significant associations between various diseases and specific gene modules, which validate our predictive accuracy for predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lack associations themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers novel strategies to contextualize genetic associations by integrating gene co-expression patterns and unveils potential targets missed by single-gene approaches.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By determining how genes influence complex traits with mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, we provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Our method reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies in drug repurposing and identifies key players involved in disease origin and progression using transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate the importance of PhenoPLIER's approach by finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation. In conclusion, our study fills an essential gap in understanding genetic studies by projecting gene expression patterns and unveiling disease etiology and drug mechanisms using functional genomics.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging gene module expression across different conditions, we gain insights into the mechanistic regulation of complex traits and develop new therapeutic strategies.\n\nWe demonstrate the power of our method by identifying significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and their underlying mechanisms. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we reveal that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking associations themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of co-expressed gene groups with PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules provides a valuable tool for advancing functional genomics research in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, demonstrating how PhenoPLIER effectively identifies functional players and prioritizes them within trait-associated gene modules.\n\nIn summary, by incorporating co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework to interpret genetic associations and uncover novel therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked through traditional single-gene strategies.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This approach allows us to study complex traits by considering how genes act in concert with each other under different conditions. \n\nMethod: By analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies, we demonstrate the importance of understanding gene expression regulation in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across relevant cell types and uses them to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their therapeutic mechanisms. We further validate our approach using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation.\n\nResults: Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene expression patterns in specific cell types, validating the utility of our method for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, we find functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules but lacking associations, suggesting they could be valuable candidates for drug repurposing efforts. \n\nConclusion: PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to contextualize genetic associations and uncover undiscovered therapeutic mechanisms by integrating groups of co-expressed genes. This approach has broad implications for understanding disease etiology and developing new therapies in the field of functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

This method helps to determine how genes influence complex traits by uncovering the mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been useful in identifying individual gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in origin and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we find are significantly associated with disease cell types.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

            "We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

              "text": "This research addresses the gap in understanding how gene expression patterns contribute to complex diseases and drug mechanisms. By focusing on co-expression of genes, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap between genetic studies and therapeutic targets. Our study reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using PhenoPLIER, a novel approach for repurposing drugs by contextualizing genetic associations. This methodology provides an accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and enhances our mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate its utility through the CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, identifying functionally important players prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking associations. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER can offer a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thus advancing our knowledge on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Genetic studies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits. However, understanding the intricate interplay of genes and their expression patterns in distinct contexts remains a challenge. Our study addresses this gap by developing PhenoPLIER - an innovative approach for predicting drug repurposing targets based on gene co-expression patterns. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific cell types through our analysis of known drug-disease pairs, revealing novel mechanistic insights into therapeutic targets. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we highlight the prioritization of functionally important players in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER - demonstrating its potential for gene co-expression clustering and drug repurposing. In conclusion, our work highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover untapped therapeutic potentials missed by single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, PhenoPLIER advances functional genomics research in drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This understanding is vital for the discovery of new therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. We further demonstrate the importance of PhenoPLIER, which identifies functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by our CRISPR screen on lipid regulation. In conclusion, using groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover novel targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, existing studies often overlook the potential of integrating these patterns to predict drug mechanisms and repurposing opportunities. Consequently, a gap exists in literature addressing the use of gene modules to project genetic associations and elucidate therapeutic targets.\n\nContent: In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach for projecting genetic associations through co-expression patterns among genes involved in complex traits. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our method contextualized disease etiology and identified novel drug repurposing opportunities. We utilized a CRISPR screen to validate our findings on lipid regulation, revealing the potential of PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for predicting therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies.\n\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate that incorporating gene co-expression patterns significantly enhances genetic association projections and uncovers overlooked drug mechanisms and repurposing options in complex diseases. By employing our novel framework, PhenoPLIER, researchers can now more accurately predict the etiology of disease and identify potential therapeutic targets to address a wide range of complex traits.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Based on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across identical conditions, this method enables the identification of diseases that are strongly associated with specific cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, elucidating mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

By analyzing diseases associated with specific cell types and predicting known drug-disease pairs accurately, it demonstrates its usefulness in identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.\n\nThe conclusion interprets these findings by showing that PhenoPLIER effectively identifies disease mechanisms and prioritizes functionally important players involved in complex trait regulation.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining complex traits, highlighting the importance of understanding gene-gene interactions for disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing methods fail to capture this intricate interplay effectively. Consequently, new therapies often fall short in addressing the root causes of diseases. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By utilizing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, our method effectively projects genetic associations and enables accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilize a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only fills the current gap in literature regarding gene co-expression but also paves the way for drug repurposing strategies based on our findings, ultimately moving the field forward with promising therapeutic targets and insights into disease etiology.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Our study aims to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms through projecting gene expression patterns. The content section presents PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates transcriptome data with pharmacological perturbation information, enabling the mapping of trait associations onto common latent representations derived from modules exhibiting similar expression profiles across different conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action and identifying functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight a novel perspective on disease etiology and suggest potential avenues for drug repurposing by leveraging gene co-expression patterns.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes' role in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our findings accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting potential therapeutic targets. Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking associations. Overall, this work fills an essential gap in the literature on functional genomics and advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
