          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation

          Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific
          contexts. To understand how these cooperative genes impact complex
          traits, it is crucial to investigate expression regulation across
          various conditions. This insight holds significant implications for
          therapy development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms.
          However, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are vital in disease etiology and progression. We present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and common latent
          representations derived from clusters of genes with similar expression
          patterns across conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while
          inferring mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen examining lipid
          regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          without direct genetic associations but found within trait-associated
          co-expression modules. By considering groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetics through the lens of gene
          expression modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific
          contexts, highlighting the importance of understanding expression
          regulation across diverse conditions to elucidate their influence on
          complex traits. This knowledge is essential for advancing novel
          therapeutic developments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          indeed uncovered individual genes' roles in disease-related
          mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. We present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and common latent
          representation based on modules of genes displaying similar expression
          patterns across various conditions. Disease associations are primarily
          found with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using our
          approach. It accurately predicts known drug-disease correlations and
          identifies drugs' mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant players
          lacking direct genetic association but identified within
          trait-associated gene modules. In summary, incorporating co-expressed
          genes in the analysis contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
          potential targets that single-gene strategies might miss. By
          interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for understanding complex traits and
          developing targeted therapies.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions within specific contexts.
          To understand how these cooperative genetic factors influence complex
          traits, it is essential to examine expression regulation across
          various conditions. This insight plays a pivotal role in developing
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed significantly by revealing the individual gene's
          involvement in disease mechanisms. However, recent models propose that
          gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease onset and progression.
          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology.
          It maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is derived from modules of genes that exhibit similar
          expression patterns across comparable conditions. We found that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease correlations and elucidating mechanisms
          of action. Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally essential players without direct genetic
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic links through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          conditions, crucial for developing innovative therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable

          Genes collaboratively execute their functions in specific contexts,
          emphasizing the need to understand how they influence complex traits
          by examining expression regulation across various conditions. This
          insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been valuable in revealing individual genes'
          roles in disease mechanisms. However, current models suggest that

          and common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
          genes across conditions. These gene modules are expressed in relevant
          cell types for associated diseases. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease correlations and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          In a CRISPR screen aimed at analyzing lipid regulation, we found that
          essential players without direct associations were prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering co-expressed

          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Ultimately,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic

          In the quest to understand complex traits and develop targeted
          therapies, it is crucial to examine genes' cooperative actions within
          specific contexts. This necessitates elucidating expression regulation
          across diverse conditions. Such insights are essential for advancing
          therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in revealing individual gene roles in disease
          mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to diseases' onset and
          progression. To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER – a
          computational approach that unifies gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          based on modules of similarly expressed genes across conditions. Our
          analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease connections and elucidates mechanisms of
          action. By using CRISPR screens for lipid regulation analysis, we
          discover that functionally essential players lacking direct
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights
          potential targets missed through single-gene strategies, providing a
          groundbreaking framework to interpret genetic associations through the
          lens of gene modules.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often
          collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, implying
          the significance of understanding expression regulation across various
          conditions to decipher their impact on complex traits. This insight is
          crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have facilitated discovering individual genes' roles in
          disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          disease genesis and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation depends
          on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observed that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, by analyzing lipid regulation
          using a CRISPR screen, we found functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. By interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a
          groundbreaking framework for advancing our understanding of complex
          traits' etiology and drug mechanisms.

           In the quest to unravel complex traits' underlying mechanisms, studying gene expression patterns and their interactions offers valuable insights. Existing single-gene strategies often overlook functionally significant players due to weak or absent direct genetic associations. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this shortcoming by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By recognizing genes as part of functional networks, where they collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, PhenoPLIER aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This mechanistic view is crucial for advancing novel therapy development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, recent complex traits models suggest gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression.

          PhenoPLIER's representation hinges on groups of co-expressed genes
          with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We
          demonstrate that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease interactions while revealing mechanisms of action. As an
          example, when applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen investigating
          lipid regulation, we found functionally essential genes lacking
          genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's capacity to contextualize genetic
          associations through co-expressed gene modules enhances the
          interpretation of genetic findings and helps uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. By adopting a holistic
          perspective, PhenoPLIER provides a groundbreaking framework for
          interpreting genetic associations using gene module analysis. This
          innovative approach has significant implications in advancing our
          understanding of complex traits' etiology and improving therapeutic
          target identification.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait association data and pharmacological perturbation
          information into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.
          The functional role of genes is often determined by their
          collaborative actions within specific contexts. To understand how
          these collaborations contribute to complex traits, it's crucial to
          examine expression regulation across distinct conditions. This
          knowledge is vital in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have facilitated the discovery of individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease
          development and progression. PhenoPLIER constructs its representation
          based on groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns
          across shared conditions. Our findings show that diseases are strongly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Moreover, our approach precisely predicts known drug-disease
          connections and reveals mechanisms of action. By examining a CRISPR
          screen investigating lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          significant genes lacking associations were prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by considering
          co-expressed gene sets, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and expose potentially overlooked targets from
          single-gene approaches. The utilization of gene modules for
          interpreting genetic associations offers a unique framework through
          PhenoPLIER.

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the quest to unravel complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
          existing research faces a gap in understanding how genes
          collaboratively contribute to traits under different conditions. This
          limitation hampers therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.
          Our paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a groundbreaking computational
          approach that tackles this issue by unifying gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
          representation for joint analysis. Leveraging the concept of genes
          functioning in concert within specific contexts, we aim to provide
          insights into their role in complex traits. Such understanding is
          crucial in advancing novel therapy development.


          To address the current limitations, we build upon transcriptome-wide
          association studies that identify individual gene functions in disease
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest a significant
          influence of gene-gene interactions on disease origination and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of
          co-expressed genes across conditions, which we find to be associated
          with diseases enriched in relevant cell types. Our approach
          demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          deciphering mechanisms of action.


          We further substantiate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through a
          CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, where we discovered
          functionally important genes lacking single-gene associations but
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. In
          conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets that would otherwise go unnoticed with single-gene
          strategies. By bridging gene expression patterns and genetic studies,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective for interpreting complex trait
          genetics, advancing functional genomics and drug development.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a groundbreaking computational approach that
          harmoniously integrates gene-trait association data with
          pharmacological perturbation information into a shared latent
          representation for joint analysis. Recognizing the interplay among
          genes in specific contexts is crucial to understand their functional
          roles. Investigating how these collaborative genetic factors impact
          complex traits requires an in-depth comprehension of expression
          regulation across various conditions. This understanding has proven
          vital in developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have led to the identification of individual
          genes' involvement in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary
          complex trait models emphasize the significance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          representation is centered on modules containing genes with similar
          expression patterns across shared conditions. Our study reveals that
          diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts established
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important genes, which are typically underrepresented in
          genetic association studies, can be prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's
          incorporation of co-expressed gene clusters contextualizes genetic
          associations and unveils potential targets potentially overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. By interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework that
          promises to revolutionize our understanding of disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the field of genetic studies, understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms requires unraveling the complex interactions between genes and their regulatory networks. While functional genomics offers insights into individual gene roles in diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in disease origin and progression. The existing gap lies in the need for an innovative approach to map genetic associations with pharmacological perturbations while considering co-expression patterns among genes.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that addresses
          this challenge by jointly analyzing gene-trait associations and drug
          data within a shared latent representation. This framework recognizes
          the concerted actions of genes under specific contexts to perform
          their functions and emphasizes the importance of understanding
          expression regulation across various conditions for interpreting gene
          influence on complex traits. It has significant implications for
          therapy development.


          PhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on gene modules that
          exhibit similar expression patterns across diverse conditions,
          enabling it to identify diseases significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of
          action. We further validate its effectiveness through a CRISPR screen
          targeting lipid regulation, where PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important players that lack direct genetic associations.


          In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
          missed by single-gene approaches. By integrating genetic studies with
          functional genomics perspectives, PhenoPLIER's groundbreaking
          framework can guide future research in drug repurposing and
          therapeutic target identification while advancing our understanding of
          the clustering of complex traits.

We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed predominantly in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, by examining a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we observe that functionally essential genes, often lacking single-gene associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight how PhenoPLIER''s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can provide context to genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed using single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

           In the pursuit to unravel complex trait origins and drug mechanisms, there is a growing need for comprehensive approaches that consider gene-gene interactions and expression patterns. Existing methods often overlook the intricate roles genes play within functional contexts. This gap limits our understanding of disease etiology and hampers therapeutic target discovery. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

          PhenoPLIER capitalizes on the notion that genes function
          collaboratively in specific contexts to perform their tasks. By
          delving into expression regulation across distinct conditions, it
          provides valuable insights for novel therapy development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene
          roles in disease mechanisms, contemporary complex trait models
          highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease onset
          and progression.


          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on clusters of genes displaying
          similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships while elucidating their mechanisms of
          action. A CRISPR screen for lipid regulation further supports
          PhenoPLIER's effectiveness: functionally critical players, lacking
          direct associations, were prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by our method.


          In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
          expands our capacity to understand disease etiology and accelerate
          drug discovery processes.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. The collaborative
          actions of genes in specific contexts are crucial for their
          functionality. To comprehend how these interconnected genes impact
          complex traits, it is essential to understand the regulation of gene
          expression across various conditions. This insight holds significant
          importance in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have aided in uncovering individual gene roles in
          disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, recent models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play an integral part in the origin and progression of
          complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded on modules of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant
          conditions. We observe a significant association between diseases and
          gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, demonstrating
          PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting established drug-disease
          relationships and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
          analyzing lipid regulation through CRISPR screening, we find that
          functionally essential genes, often lacking single-gene associations,
          are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER's
          approach. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative
          PhenoPLIER framework provides a fresh perspective for interpreting
          genetic connections through the lens of gene modules.

           In investigating complex traits, it remains a challenge to unravel the intricate relationships between genes and their influence on diseases and drug mechanisms. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across various conditions. While gene-trait associations from transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, there is a need for improved methods to explore the critical role of gene interactions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for joint analysis.

          PhenoPLIER's innovation lies in its use of gene modules as its
          underlying representation. These modules consist of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across different conditions, reflecting
          their coordinated actions within specific contexts. By studying the
          relationships between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, we observe significant associations, demonstrating
          PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, when applied to a CRISPR screen assessing lipid
          regulation, we find that functional but unassociated genes are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
          finding highlights the capacity for our approach to identify potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, through incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and
          reveals hidden mechanisms in disease etiology and drug action. As a
          result, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations via the lens of gene modules, filling a critical gap in
          functional genomics research.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In complex biological systems, genes collaboratively execute their
          functions in specific contexts. To elucidate the influence of these
          interconnected genes on intricate traits, it is imperative to grasp
          their regulatory mechanisms across varying conditions. Research has
          indicated that such insights play a crucial role in drug development.
          Our study's findings showcase how diseases significantly correlate
          with gene modules expressed within relevant cell types. Consequently,
          our approach accurately predicts established disease-drug associations
          and uncovers the underlying action mechanisms. Additionally, we
          employed CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation; our results
          indicate that functionally significant genes, which typically lack
          direct genetic associations, are prioritized within trait-associated
          gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by considering clusters of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential targets missed through single-gene approaches.
          By integrating gene modules into the analysis, PhenoPLIER presents a
          novel perspective for deciphering genetic linkages.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

Elucidating expression regulation across diverse conditions plays a pivotal role in developing novel therapies. Our study focuses on bridging the gap between genetics and functional genomics by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to cell-type-specific modules of co-expressed genes, and our approach effectively predicts established drug-disease connections while uncovering mechanisms of action. As an illustration, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we found that crucial but genetically underrepresented players were highlighted by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our method PhenoPLIER, which incorporates co-expressed gene groups, can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene approaches.

          In complex biological systems, genes collaborate to execute their
          functions under specific circumstances. To comprehend how these
          interactions influence multifaceted traits, it is essential to grasp
          the regulatory aspects of gene expression across diverse conditions.
          Research has proven that this understanding is crucial for devising
          innovative therapies. Our study reveals that diseases tend to
          correlate with co-expressed gene modules predominantly active in
          pertinent cell types. This approach efficiently predicts established
          drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms underlying
          therapeutic actions. In addition, we applied a CRISPR screen for
          studying lipid regulation and found that functionally critical genes,
          which may not exhibit strong genetic associations, are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. To summarize,
          PhenoPLIER, an innovative methodology, contextualizes genetic
          connections via co-expressed gene groups and highlights potentially
          overlooked targets in single-gene investigations. By employing a
          multi-gene perspective, PhenoPLIER offers novel insights into
          deciphering genetic correlations.

To validate its effectiveness, we analyzed a lipid regulation CRISPR screen and found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes not directly associated with traits.

          In complex biological systems, genes collaboratively execute their
          functions within specific contexts. Unraveling how these cooperative
          genetic networks influence intricate traits necessitates understanding
          expression regulation across various conditions. Numerous studies have
          emphasized the significance of this insight for developing novel
          therapeutics. Our study demonstrates that diseases are substantially
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is reliable in predicting established drug-disease
          relationships and deciphering their mechanisms of action. Moreover, by
          employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observed
          that functionally critical genes, which might be overlooked due to a
          lack of direct genetic associations, are prioritized within
          trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene clusters
          contextualizes genetic associations and identifies targets that may
          evade single-gene strategies. By highlighting genetic connections
          through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER establishes a novel
          paradigm for interpreting complex genetics and its implications in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic correlations and unveils potential targets
          often neglected in single-gene analyses. This innovative approach,
          facilitated by PhenoPLIER, offers a fresh perspective for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          In the pursuit of understanding complex traits, genes are recognized
          to collaboratively execute their functions within specific contexts.
          To decipher these gene interactions across various conditions
          necessitates delving into expression regulation mechanisms. This
          insight holds significant potential for driving novel therapy
          development. Our study highlights how PhenoPLIER, our innovative
          approach, links diseases to gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships
          and elucidating mechanisms of action. We further demonstrate
          PhenoPLIER's effectiveness by analyzing lipid regulation through a
          CRISPR screen. Our findings reveal that functional players with
          insignificant direct associations are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the limitations
          of single-gene strategies. By integrating co-expressed gene clusters,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic links and reveals potential targets
          obscured by conventional methods. In conclusion, this study
          underscores PhenoPLIER's groundbreaking role in interpreting genetic
          associations through a gene module lens, potentially revolutionizing
          our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes collaboratively execute their functions within specific
          environments. To comprehend how these cooperative genes influence
          complex traits, it is crucial to understand expression regulation
          across various conditions. Research has demonstrated that this
          knowledge is vital for developing innovative therapies. Our study
          showcases the significance of gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types being associated with diseases. Our approach accurately predicts
          established drug-disease pairs and reveals mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation,
          we identify functionally crucial genes that lack direct associations
          but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules through
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, by considering groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic findings and expose potentially
          overlooked targets when using single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          introduces a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Collaborative gene functioning is crucial for executing their tasks
          within specific contexts. Understanding gene influence on complex
          traits necessitates an exploration of expression regulation across
          diverse conditions. This perspective is vital in advancing novel
          therapeutic developments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          aided the discovery of individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
          a fundamental part in disease emergence and progression. In this work,
          we present PhenoPLIER—a computational methodology—which integrates
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is grounded on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease associations while unveiling mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we applied a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, revealing that functionally significant genes, which may
          lack direct associations, are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must

          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          In intricate biological networks, genes collaboratively execute their
          functional roles within specific settings. To fully comprehend how
          these gene interactions influence complex traits, it's crucial to
          understand expression regulation across varying conditions. This
          knowledge is vital for developing novel therapeutic interventions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          identifying the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms.
          However, current perspectives on complex trait architecture suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin
          and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is rooted in modules of genes displaying similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed predominantly in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          precisely predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR
          screening, we found that functionally significant genes, without
          direct associations, were prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by our approach.

           In the pursuit of understanding gene functions and their impact on complex traits, it is crucial to decipher gene interactions within specific contexts and across diverse conditions. This knowledge has significant implications for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed by revealing individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary perspectives on the genetic architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal part in diseases' emergence and development. 

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that unifies gene-trait
          association data with pharmacological perturbation information into a
          shared representation based on coexpressed gene modules. By studying
          these gene expression patterns across conditions, our approach can
          link diseases to modules expressed in relevant cell types and
          accurately predict known drug-disease relationships while inferring
          their mechanisms of action. 


          In an application example using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are embedded within trait-associated modules. This
          approach advances our understanding of gene interactions and complex
          traits' etiology, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic
          targets and enhancing drug repurposing efforts.

          In collaboration, genes carry out their functions within specific

          across various conditions. This understanding is vital for designing

          In the field of complex trait genetics, genes collaboratively execute
          their functions within specific contexts. Understanding gene influence
          on these traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This knowledge is crucial for advancing
          therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          uncovered individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms.
          However, recent complex trait models emphasize the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in diseases' origins and progressions. We
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a common latent
          representation based on coexpressed gene modules across shared

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and it accurately

          analysis, we find that essential genes lacking associations are

          this novel approach, we aim to fill gaps in our understanding of
          complex traits' genetic basis and improve therapeutic target
          identification.

          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players

          PhenoPLIER.

This insight has been underscored by previous research. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to revealing individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules with analogous expression patterns across conditions. Our approach demonstrates that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, exhibiting high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease interactions while elucidating mechanisms of action. Notably, applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights functionally significant genes lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules.'

          Collaborative gene functioning within specific contexts is essential
          for carrying out their respective functions. To understand how these
          genes contribute to complex traits, it's crucial to grasp expression
          regulation across diverse conditions. This comprehension holds
          significance in developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have facilitated discovering individual genes'
          roles in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          vital role in disease development and progression. We introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that aligns gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation stems from
          modules encompassing genes with comparable expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our study shows that diseases exhibit significant
          correlations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER effectively predicts established drug-disease pairs and
          reveals mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation analysis, we identified that functionally crucial
          genes, which may lack associations, are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by our approach.

Our approach demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and reveals mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking direct associations but situated within trait-associated modules. Overall, our work highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in projecting genetic associations and provides new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific
              contexts. To understand how these cooperative genes impact complex
              traits, it is crucial to investigate expression regulation across
              various conditions. This insight holds significant implications
              for therapy development. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped identify the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are vital in disease etiology and
              progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation
              data, and common latent representations derived from clusters of
              genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships while inferring
              mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen examining lipid
              regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
              without direct genetic associations but found within
              trait-associated co-expression modules. By considering groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetics through the lens of gene expression modules.

              Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific
              contexts, highlighting the importance of understanding expression
              regulation across diverse conditions to elucidate their influence
              on complex traits. This knowledge is essential for advancing novel
              therapeutic developments. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have indeed uncovered individual genes' roles in disease-related
              mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of

              data, and common latent representation based on modules of genes
              displaying similar expression patterns across various conditions.
              Disease associations are primarily found with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types using our approach. It accurately
              predicts known drug-disease correlations and identifies drugs'
              mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant players lacking
              direct genetic association but identified within trait-associated
              gene modules. In summary, incorporating co-expressed genes in the
              analysis contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
              targets that single-gene strategies might miss. By interpreting
              genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a

              targeted therapies.

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions within specific
              contexts. To understand how these cooperative genetic factors
              influence complex traits, it is essential to examine expression
              regulation across various conditions. This insight plays a pivotal
              role in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have contributed significantly by revealing the individual
              gene's involvement in disease mechanisms. However, recent models
              propose that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease onset
              and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived
              from modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns
              across comparable conditions. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting
              known drug-disease correlations and elucidating mechanisms of
              action. Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally essential players without direct
              genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of

              Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific

            text: ' In the field of understanding complex traits, investigating genes'' collaborative actions in specific contexts is crucial for unveiling their functions and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to revealing individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. To address this, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations, pharmacological data, and expression patterns across different conditions.

We observe that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while identifying mechanisms of action.

              Genes collaboratively execute their functions in specific
              contexts, emphasizing the need to understand how they influence
              complex traits by examining expression regulation across various
              conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              valuable in revealing individual genes' roles in disease
              mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and
              progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation
              data, and common latent representation based on modules of
              co-expressed genes across conditions. These gene modules are
              expressed in relevant cell types for associated diseases. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease correlations and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen aimed at
              analyzing lipid regulation, we found that essential players
              without direct associations were prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering
              co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene

              In the quest to understand complex traits and develop targeted
              therapies, it is crucial to examine genes' cooperative actions
              within specific contexts. This necessitates elucidating expression
              regulation across diverse conditions. Such insights are essential
              for advancing therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual
              gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern complex trait
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to diseases' onset and progression. To address this
              challenge, we present PhenoPLIER – a computational approach that
              unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a shared latent representation based on modules of
              similarly expressed genes across conditions. Our analysis reveals
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease connections and elucidates mechanisms
              of action. By using CRISPR screens for lipid regulation analysis,
              we discover that functionally essential players lacking direct
              associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

              highlights potential targets missed through single-gene
              strategies, providing a groundbreaking framework to interpret

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often
              collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions,
              implying the significance of understanding expression regulation
              across various conditions to decipher their impact on complex
              traits. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated
              discovering individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms.
              However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease genesis and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation depends on modules
              comprising genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We observed that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, by analyzing lipid regulation
              using a CRISPR screen, we found functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed
              gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for
              advancing our understanding of complex traits' etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

               In the quest to unravel complex traits' underlying mechanisms, studying gene expression patterns and their interactions offers valuable insights. Existing single-gene strategies often overlook functionally significant players due to weak or absent direct genetic associations. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this shortcoming by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By recognizing genes as part of functional networks, where they collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, PhenoPLIER aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This mechanistic view is crucial for advancing novel therapy development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, recent complex traits models suggest gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression.

              PhenoPLIER's representation hinges on groups of co-expressed genes
              with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We
              demonstrate that diseases are associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease interactions while revealing
              mechanisms of action. As an example, when applying PhenoPLIER to a
              CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we found
              functionally essential genes lacking genetic associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's capacity to contextualize genetic
              associations through co-expressed gene modules enhances the
              interpretation of genetic findings and helps uncover potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By adopting a
              holistic perspective, PhenoPLIER provides a groundbreaking
              framework for interpreting genetic associations using gene module
              analysis. This innovative approach has significant implications in
              advancing our understanding of complex traits' etiology and
              improving therapeutic target identification.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait association data and pharmacological perturbation
              information into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. The functional role of genes is often determined by
              their collaborative actions within specific contexts. To
              understand how these collaborations contribute to complex traits,
              it's crucial to examine expression regulation across distinct
              conditions. This knowledge is vital in developing novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the
              discovery of individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms.
              However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              significantly influence disease development and progression.
              PhenoPLIER constructs its representation based on groups of
              co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across shared
              conditions. Our findings show that diseases are strongly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Moreover, our approach precisely predicts known drug-disease
              connections and reveals mechanisms of action. By examining a
              CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally significant genes lacking associations were
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, by considering co-expressed gene sets, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and expose potentially
              overlooked targets from single-gene approaches. The utilization of
              gene modules for interpreting genetic associations offers a unique
              framework through PhenoPLIER.

              In the quest to unravel complex disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, existing research faces a gap in understanding how
              genes collaboratively contribute to traits under different
              conditions. This limitation hampers therapeutic target discovery
              and drug repurposing. Our paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              groundbreaking computational approach that tackles this issue by
              unifying gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.
              Leveraging the concept of genes functioning in concert within
              specific contexts, we aim to provide insights into their role in
              complex traits. Such understanding is crucial in advancing novel
              therapy development.


              To address the current limitations, we build upon
              transcriptome-wide association studies that identify individual
              gene functions in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              suggest a significant influence of gene-gene interactions on
              disease origination and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation
              is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across conditions,
              which we find to be associated with diseases enriched in relevant
              cell types. Our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action.


              We further substantiate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through a
              CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, where we discovered
              functionally important genes lacking single-gene associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. In
              conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets that would otherwise go unnoticed
              with single-gene strategies. By bridging gene expression patterns
              and genetic studies, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective for
              interpreting complex trait genetics, advancing functional genomics
              and drug development.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a groundbreaking computational approach
              that harmoniously integrates gene-trait association data with
              pharmacological perturbation information into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. Recognizing the interplay among
              genes in specific contexts is crucial to understand their
              functional roles. Investigating how these collaborative genetic
              factors impact complex traits requires an in-depth comprehension
              of expression regulation across various conditions. This
              understanding has proven vital in developing new therapeutic
              strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have led to the
              identification of individual genes' involvement in disease
              mechanisms. However, contemporary complex trait models emphasize
              the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is centered on modules
              containing genes with similar expression patterns across shared
              conditions. Our study reveals that diseases significantly
              correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs
              and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR
              screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
              important genes, which are typically underrepresented in genetic
              association studies, can be prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation
              of co-expressed gene clusters contextualizes genetic associations
              and unveils potential targets potentially overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. By interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a unique
              framework that promises to revolutionize our understanding of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               In the field of genetic studies, understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms requires unraveling the complex interactions between genes and their regulatory networks. While functional genomics offers insights into individual gene roles in diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in disease origin and progression. The existing gap lies in the need for an innovative approach to map genetic associations with pharmacological perturbations while considering co-expression patterns among genes.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              addresses this challenge by jointly analyzing gene-trait
              associations and drug data within a shared latent representation.
              This framework recognizes the concerted actions of genes under
              specific contexts to perform their functions and emphasizes the
              importance of understanding expression regulation across various
              conditions for interpreting gene influence on complex traits. It
              has significant implications for therapy development.


              PhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on gene modules that
              exhibit similar expression patterns across diverse conditions,
              enabling it to identify diseases significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their
              mechanisms of action. We further validate its effectiveness
              through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, where
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players that lack
              direct genetic associations.


              In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. By integrating
              genetic studies with functional genomics perspectives,
              PhenoPLIER's groundbreaking framework can guide future research in
              drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification while
              advancing our understanding of the clustering of complex traits.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions to decipher how they contribute to complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have led to the discovery of individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to disease development and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation leverages modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across shared conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed predominantly in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, by examining a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we observe that functionally essential genes, often lacking single-gene associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight how PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can provide context to genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed using single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               In the pursuit to unravel complex trait origins and drug mechanisms, there is a growing need for comprehensive approaches that consider gene-gene interactions and expression patterns. Existing methods often overlook the intricate roles genes play within functional contexts. This gap limits our understanding of disease etiology and hampers therapeutic target discovery. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

              PhenoPLIER capitalizes on the notion that genes function
              collaboratively in specific contexts to perform their tasks. By
              delving into expression regulation across distinct conditions, it
              provides valuable insights for novel therapy development. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual
              gene roles in disease mechanisms, contemporary complex trait
              models highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in
              disease onset and progression.


              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on clusters of genes
              displaying similar expression patterns across various conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships while elucidating their
              mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen for lipid regulation further
              supports PhenoPLIER's effectiveness: functionally critical
              players, lacking direct associations, were prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by our method.


              In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the lens of gene modules expands our capacity to understand
              disease etiology and accelerate drug discovery processes.

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for

              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. The
              collaborative actions of genes in specific contexts are crucial
              for their functionality. To comprehend how these interconnected
              genes impact complex traits, it is essential to understand the
              regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This
              insight holds significant importance in developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in
              uncovering individual gene roles in disease mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play an integral part in the origin and progression of complex
              traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant
              conditions. We observe a significant association between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, demonstrating
              PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, by
              analyzing lipid regulation through CRISPR screening, we find that
              functionally essential genes, often lacking single-gene
              associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              using PhenoPLIER's approach. In summary, by incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This innovative PhenoPLIER framework
              provides a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic connections
              through the lens of gene modules.

               In investigating complex traits, it remains a challenge to unravel the intricate relationships between genes and their influence on diseases and drug mechanisms. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across various conditions. While gene-trait associations from transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, there is a need for improved methods to explore the critical role of gene interactions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for joint analysis.

              PhenoPLIER's innovation lies in its use of gene modules as its
              underlying representation. These modules consist of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across different
              conditions, reflecting their coordinated actions within specific
              contexts. By studying the relationships between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, we observe significant
              associations, demonstrating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, when applied to a CRISPR screen assessing lipid
              regulation, we find that functional but unassociated genes are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              finding highlights the capacity for our approach to identify
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, through incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
              PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and
              reveals hidden mechanisms in disease etiology and drug action. As
              a result, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, filling a
              critical gap in functional genomics research.

              In complex biological systems, genes collaboratively execute their
              functions in specific contexts. To elucidate the influence of
              these interconnected genes on intricate traits, it is imperative
              to grasp their regulatory mechanisms across varying conditions.
              Research has indicated that such insights play a crucial role in
              drug development. Our study's findings showcase how diseases
              significantly correlate with gene modules expressed within
              relevant cell types. Consequently, our approach accurately
              predicts established disease-drug associations and uncovers the
              underlying action mechanisms. Additionally, we employed CRISPR
              screening to examine lipid regulation; our results indicate that
              functionally significant genes, which typically lack direct
              genetic associations, are prioritized within trait-associated gene
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by considering clusters of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and identify potential targets missed through
              single-gene approaches. By integrating gene modules into the
              analysis, PhenoPLIER presents a novel perspective for deciphering
              genetic linkages.

               In investigating gene function, it is crucial to understand their collaborative actions in specific contexts for unraveling complex traits. Elucidating expression regulation across diverse conditions plays a pivotal role in developing novel therapies. Our study focuses on bridging the gap between genetics and functional genomics by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to cell-type-specific modules of co-expressed genes, and our approach effectively predicts established drug-disease connections while uncovering mechanisms of action. As an illustration, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we found that crucial but genetically underrepresented players were highlighted by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our method PhenoPLIER, which incorporates co-expressed gene groups, can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. By doing so, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetics via the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In complex biological systems, genes collaborate to execute their
              functions under specific circumstances. To comprehend how these
              interactions influence multifaceted traits, it is essential to
              grasp the regulatory aspects of gene expression across diverse
              conditions. Research has proven that this understanding is crucial
              for devising innovative therapies. Our study reveals that diseases
              tend to correlate with co-expressed gene modules predominantly
              active in pertinent cell types. This approach efficiently predicts
              established drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms
              underlying therapeutic actions. In addition, we applied a CRISPR
              screen for studying lipid regulation and found that functionally
              critical genes, which may not exhibit strong genetic associations,
              are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. To
              summarize, PhenoPLIER, an innovative methodology, contextualizes
              genetic connections via co-expressed gene groups and highlights
              potentially overlooked targets in single-gene investigations. By
              employing a multi-gene perspective, PhenoPLIER offers novel
              insights into deciphering genetic correlations.

              In complex biological systems, genes collaboratively execute their
              functions within specific contexts. Unraveling how these
              cooperative genetic networks influence intricate traits
              necessitates understanding expression regulation across various
              conditions. Numerous studies have emphasized the significance of
              this insight for developing novel therapeutics. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are substantially associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              reliable in predicting established drug-disease relationships and
              deciphering their mechanisms of action. Moreover, by employing a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observed that
              functionally critical genes, which might be overlooked due to a
              lack of direct genetic associations, are prioritized within
              trait-associated gene modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene clusters
              contextualizes genetic associations and identifies targets that
              may evade single-gene strategies. By highlighting genetic

              establishes a novel paradigm for interpreting complex genetics and
              its implications in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            text: ' In complex traits research, understanding gene interactions within specific contexts is vital for unraveling their regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial in developing innovative therapies. Our study bridges this gap by presenting PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease relationships and illuminating drug mechanism of actions. Further, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we found functionally significant genes lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the incorporation of co-expressed gene groups in PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic findings and uncovers potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook.

              In complex biological systems, genes collaboratively execute their
              functions within specific contexts. To understand how these gene
              interactions contribute to intricate traits, it's essential to
              delve into expression regulation patterns across various
              conditions. Studies have demonstrated that this knowledge is
              crucial for developing innovative therapies. Our research presents
              results illustrating a significant association between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our methodology
              accurately forecasts established drug-disease connections while
              unraveling their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we examined
              lipid regulation through CRISPR screening, revealing that
              functionally crucial genes lacking direct associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic correlations and unveils potential targets
              often neglected in single-gene analyses. This innovative approach,

              In the pursuit of understanding complex traits, genes are
              recognized to collaboratively execute their functions within
              specific contexts. To decipher these gene interactions across
              various conditions necessitates delving into expression regulation
              mechanisms. This insight holds significant potential for driving
              novel therapy development. Our study highlights how PhenoPLIER,
              our innovative approach, links diseases to gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, accurately predicting established
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action.
              We further demonstrate PhenoPLIER's effectiveness by analyzing
              lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen. Our findings reveal that
              functional players with insignificant direct associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER,
              highlighting the limitations of single-gene strategies. By

              genetic links and reveals potential targets obscured by
              conventional methods. In conclusion, this study underscores

              associations through a gene module lens, potentially
              revolutionizing our understanding of disease etiology and drug

              Genes collaboratively execute their functions within specific

              showcases the significance of gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types being associated with diseases. Our approach accurately

We show that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting the accuracy of our approach to predict known drug-disease connections and decipher mechanisms of action. Our findings from a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation further demonstrate how functionally significant players, which are often overlooked due to lack of direct genetic associations, can be prioritized through PhenoPLIER''s trait-associated gene modules. By contextualizing genetic associations via co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enhances the identification of potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches. This study presents a novel framework for interpreting genetics through the lens of functional gene modules using PhenoPLIER.'

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,

              Collaborative gene functioning is crucial for executing their
              tasks within specific contexts. Understanding gene influence on
              complex traits necessitates an exploration of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions. This perspective is vital in
              advancing novel therapeutic developments. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have aided the discovery of individual genes'
              roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a fundamental part in disease
              emergence and progression. In this work, we present PhenoPLIER—a
              computational methodology—which integrates gene-trait associations
              with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded
              on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach demonstrates high accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease associations while unveiling
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, we applied a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant genes, which may lack direct associations, are

               In the pursuit of understanding gene functions and their impact on complex traits, it is crucial to decipher gene interactions within specific contexts and across diverse conditions. This knowledge has significant implications for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed by revealing individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary perspectives on the genetic architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal part in diseases' emergence and development. 

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that unifies
              gene-trait association data with pharmacological perturbation
              information into a shared representation based on coexpressed gene
              modules. By studying these gene expression patterns across
              conditions, our approach can link diseases to modules expressed in
              relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease
              relationships while inferring their mechanisms of action. 


              In an application example using a CRISPR screen for lipid

              that lack direct associations but are embedded within

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In collaboration, genes carry out their functions within specific
              contexts. To comprehend the influence of these gene interactions
              on complex traits, it is essential to understand expression
              regulation across various conditions. This understanding is vital
              for designing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped identify individual genes' roles in disease
              mechanisms. However, contemporary complex trait models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in disease
              development and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is anchored
              on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our observations reveal significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, ensuring PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting
              known drug-disease relationships and uncovering mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, applying a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally essential genes lacking
              direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by our approach.

              In the field of complex trait genetics, genes collaboratively
              execute their functions within specific contexts. Understanding
              gene influence on these traits necessitates elucidating expression
              regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is crucial
              for advancing therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have uncovered individual genes' roles in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, recent complex trait models
              emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in diseases'
              origins and progressions. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations with
              pharmacological data into a common latent representation based on
              coexpressed gene modules across shared conditions. Our approach
              reveals that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and it accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships while inferring mechanisms of action.
              In the context of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis,
              we find that essential genes lacking associations are prioritized
              by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. Through this novel
              approach, we aim to fill gaps in our understanding of complex
              traits' genetic basis and improve therapeutic target
              identification.

              Collaborative gene functioning within specific contexts is
              essential for carrying out their tasks. Unraveling the influence
              of these genes on complex traits necessitates a comprehensive
              understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions.
              This insight has been demonstrated to be crucial in developing
              novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              successfully identified individual gene roles in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
              genesis and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational methodology that aligns gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is built on
              clusters of genes exhibiting analogous expression patterns across
              the same conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while
              deciphering their mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing
              CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we identified
              functionally important players lacking direct associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER.

            text: ' In investigating the collaborative nature of genes in carrying out their functions, understanding expression regulation across diverse conditions is crucial for deciphering gene influences on complex traits and advancing therapeutic development. This insight has been underscored by previous research. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to revealing individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules with analogous expression patterns across conditions. Our approach demonstrates that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, exhibiting high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease interactions while elucidating mechanisms of action. Notably, applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights functionally significant genes lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules.'

              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Collaborative gene functioning within specific contexts is
              essential for carrying out their respective functions. To
              understand how these genes contribute to complex traits, it's
              crucial to grasp expression regulation across diverse conditions.
              This comprehension holds significance in developing novel
              therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              facilitated discovering individual genes' roles in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role

              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation stems from
              modules encompassing genes with comparable expression patterns
              across the same conditions. Our study shows that diseases exhibit
              significant correlations with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER effectively predicts established
              drug-disease pairs and reveals mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we identified
              that functionally crucial genes, which may lack associations, are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by our approach.
