          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
          perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
          base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the

          Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific
          contexts, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions to decipher their influence on
          complex traits. This insight is pivotal for therapy development.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, contemporary models
          suggest gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in disease genesis
          and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on gene modules exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across various conditions. Disease association with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types has been observed. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          functionally vital genes lacking associations were prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed through single-gene
          strategies. By interpreting genetic associations via gene module lens,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for uncovering disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes operate collaboratively in specific contexts to execute their
          functional roles. To elucidate gene influence on complex traits, it is
          essential to understand expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. Such insights hold significance for therapy development.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights
          into genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          approaches to complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. In
          this context, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational framework that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation relies on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns across shared conditions. We observe that diseases
          significantly associate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          associations while inferring mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen
          studying lipid regulation, we find functionally significant players
          lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of
          co-expressed gene groups contextualizes genetic associations and
          identifies potential targets missed using single-gene strategies.
          Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic links through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' In the quest to understand complex traits, gene interactions in specific contexts hold valuable insights for advancing therapeutic discoveries. Exploring gene expression regulation across diverse conditions offers essential mechanistic knowledge for this pursuit. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms, yet modern models highlight the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation based on co-expressed gene modules across similar conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease connections while unraveling mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally crucial genes without direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by leveraging groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, unveiling potential targets often missed by single-gene approaches. This groundbreaking framework provided by PhenoPLIER enhances our ability to interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and paves the way for more comprehensive disease understanding and drug discovery strategies.'

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions
          collectively. To understand how these gene interactions influence
          complex traits, it is essential to study expression regulation across
          diverse conditions. This understanding plays a pivotal role in
          developing new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have successfully revealed the individual genes' involvement
          in disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, modern complex trait models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
          disease origins and progression. Herein, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using modules
          of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across specific
          conditions. Our results indicate significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms of action.
          Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally essential players lacking single-gene associations are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
          by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          through single-gene strategies. By integrating gene modules into
          interpreting genetic associations, PhenoPLIER presents a novel
          framework for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Gene
          functions often rely on collaborative efforts among themselves in
          specific contexts. Unraveling these gene influences on complex traits
          necessitates an understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions, which has proven critical for developing novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in disease development
          and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is anchored on modules of
          co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We observe significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, making our approach reliable for predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and unraveling mechanisms of action. In addition,
          by utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally vital genes lacking direct associations are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, by
          considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and identify potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER presents a unique
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

           In the quest to understand complex traits and uncover novel therapeutic targets, the importance of examining genes within their regulatory context has become increasingly apparent. Existing methods focusing on individual gene-trait associations may overlook important mechanisms involved in disease development. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that combines gene-trait association data and pharmacological perturbation information into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is grounded in the concept that genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to perform their functions, making it essential to comprehend how they impact complex traits at the level of expression regulation across various conditions.

          PhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on modules comprising
          genes with similar expression patterns across distinct scenarios.
          Through our analysis, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          validating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and elucidating their mechanisms of action. As a practical
          application, when analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we
          found that functionally critical genes lacking direct associations
          were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's strategy of considering groups of
          co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization and interpretation
          of genetic associations, uncovering potentially overlooked targets
          that might have been missed in single-gene approaches. By
          incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to
          project genetic associations through an enriched expression
          perspective, significantly advancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

           In the quest to understand complex trait architectures and develop novel therapies, a mechanistic view of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial. Existing methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have contributed to uncovering individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, they may overlook the impact of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by jointly analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a common latent representation. 

          PhenoPLIER builds on the concept that genes function collaboratively
          in specific contexts. By identifying modules of co-expressed genes
          across shared conditions, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive view
          of gene involvement in complex traits. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease associations while revealing their mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, when applied to a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
          lacking individual genetic associations, but enriched within
          trait-associated modules.


          In conclusion, by incorporating gene co-expression patterns,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights
          potential drug targets missed in single-gene approaches. This
          innovative framework for interpreting genetic studies through the lens
          of gene expression modules advances our understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to more effective
          therapeutic development.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate
          with one another within specific contexts to carry out their
          functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions to discern how these genes influence complex
          traits. This insight has been demonstrated to be crucial in developing
          innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          aided the discovery of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms.
          However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex
          traits. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules containing

          observe that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene
          modules expressed predominantly in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screening to analyze
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally essential genes without
          direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's approach of incorporating
          co-expressed gene clusters contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Ultimately, PhenoPLIER presents a groundbreaking framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           In the pursuit of unraveling disease etiology and elucidating drug mechanisms, we encounter the limitation of single-gene strategies in capturing complex trait contributions. The context lies in recognizing that genes function intricately within specific contexts, governed by expression regulation across different conditions. This mechanistic understanding is crucial for advancing new therapies through genetic studies and functional genomics. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data within a shared latent representation for joint analysis. 

          PhenoPLIER's core concept is based on gene modules, which exhibit
          similar expression patterns under specific conditions. Our results
          showcase significant correlations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately predicts
          established drug-disease relationships and uncovers the mechanisms of
          action. For instance, when analyzing lipid regulation through a CRISPR
          screen, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important yet
          association-less genes within trait-associated modules. 


          In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential
          therapeutic targets missed by singular gene-focused methods. This
          innovative framework expands our capacity for interpreting genetic
          associations via the lens of gene modules, bolstering disease
          understanding and drug mechanism development.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that harmonizes
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for integrated analysis. Genes
          collaborate in distinct contexts to execute their functions; thus,
          comprehending their influence on complex traits necessitates
          understanding expression regulation across various conditions. This
          insight has been shown to be crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover individual
          genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of the structure of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease genesis and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules comprising genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts established drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, by applying a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identified functionally vital players that lack direct
          genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by accounting for groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. As
          a result, PhenoPLIER presents a groundbreaking framework to interpret
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

           In the pursuit of understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a gap exists in adequately capturing gene-gene interactions and functional groups within complex traits. This context highlights the need for innovative approaches to decipher gene expression patterns across conditions. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that bridges gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data through a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating modules of genes with coordinated expression patterns in specific contexts, our approach addresses the shortcoming of relying solely on individual genes to unravel disease processes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge about gene roles in diseases, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origins and progression.

          PhenoPLIER's representation allows for the successful identification
          of disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          uncovers mechanisms of action. In a case study using CRISPR to analyze
          lipid regulation, we observed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          significant genes without direct genetic association, demonstrating
          its ability to fill critical gaps in single-gene approaches.


          In conclusion, by integrating co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          provides a valuable perspective on interpreting genetic associations
          within the context of functional groups, advancing our understanding
          of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach offers a novel
          framework for linking genetics with expression patterns to inform
          therapeutic target identification and potentially drive drug
          repurposing initiatives.

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. The collaborative function of genes in specific contexts is crucial for understanding their role in complex traits. This necessitates the exploration of expression regulation across varying conditions. Such insights are essential for new therapy development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal part in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER''s representation is derived from groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across shared conditions, known as gene modules. We observe that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts established drug-disease pairings and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, by examining lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find functionally important players lacking single-gene associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER''s approach. In summary, the inclusion of co-expressed gene groups by PhenoPLIER helps contextualize genetic associations and reveals potential targets that single-gene strategies overlook.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed

          In this study, we explore the collaborative nature of genes in
          executing their functions within specific contexts. To unravel the
          influence of these gene interactions on complex traits, it is
          essential to understand expression regulation across varying
          conditions. Our research underscores the significance of such insights
          for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. Our results
          demonstrate a strong association between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, emphasizing the accuracy of our
          approach in predicting established drug-disease relationships and
          discerning mechanisms of action. By employing CRISPR screening to
          analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally vital genes
          without apparent genetic associations are prioritized within
          trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER, a novel algorithm
          developed for this purpose. In summary, by integrating co-expressed
          gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          uncover potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. This
          study introduces PhenoPLIER as a groundbreaking framework to interpret
          genetic findings within the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies, unraveling the complex interplay
          among genes and their roles in various contexts is crucial for
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study
          addresses a gap in our current understanding by emphasizing the
          importance of gene co-expression patterns. The contextual significance
          lies in the fact that existing approaches often struggle to explain
          complex traits comprehensively, limiting progress in developing new
          therapies. Our method, PhenoPLIER, presents an innovative solution by
          analyzing genes within their functional modules instead of focusing
          solely on individual associations. Results show a strong association
          between diseases and gene expression patterns in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, PhenoPLIER excels at predicting known drug-disease
          relationships while revealing their underlying mechanisms. A CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation further supports this method as it
          highlights functionally important genes that were initially overlooked
          by single-gene approaches due to the lack of genetic associations. By
          prioritizing these genes within trait-associated modules, PhenoPLIER
          effectively contextualizes genetic findings and identifies missed
          targets. This groundbreaking framework not only enhances our
          interpretation of genetic associations but also underscores the
          potential of functional genomics in advancing therapeutic target
          discovery and drug repurposing.

          In collaboration-based functioning, genes execute their roles in

          is essential to understand expression regulation across various
          conditions for mechanistic insights crucial in novel therapy
          development. Our study demonstrates that diseases correlate
          significantly with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          our approach excels in predicting known drug-disease connections while

          approaches. By utilizing gene modules as a lens for interpretation,
          PhenoPLIER presents an innovative framework for deciphering genetic

          In the pursuit of understanding complex traits, genes are recognized
          to collaboratively carry out their functions within specific contexts.
          Deciphering gene influence necessitates elucidating expression
          regulation across various conditions. This perspective is crucial for
          advancing therapeutic development. Our study presents PhenoPLIER, a
          method that demonstrates diseases' significant association with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
          predicts established drug-disease connections and uncovers mechanisms
          of action. In a case study utilizing CRISPR to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally critical genes, without apparent
          genetic associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene clusters, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Consequently, the novel framework of
          PhenoPLIER facilitates interpreting genetic links through a gene
          module lens, furthering our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          In complex biological systems, gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in performing their specific functions. Elucidating these gene
          influences on intricate traits necessitates an in-depth understanding
          of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge has
          been demonstrated to be crucial in devising novel therapies. Our study
          reveals that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene
          modules predominantly expressed in relevant cell types. Consequently,
          our approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
          correlations and unraveling the mechanisms underlying these actions.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, we
          identified functionally vital genes that lack direct genetic
          associations but are highlighted within trait-associated gene modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed
          gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic findings and
          exposes potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By
          using gene module interpretations, PhenoPLIER presents a unique
          framework to decipher complex genetic associations.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of genetic studies, disentangling the complex
          interactions among genes and their impact on traits requires a deep
          understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions.
          This insight is critical for developing innovative therapies. Our
          research aims to address this gap by proposing PhenoPLIER, an approach
          that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns in
          relevant cell types. In our study, we demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific modules of co-expressed genes.
          Notably, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          discerns their mechanisms of action. To further validate its
          effectiveness, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen studying lipid
          regulation. Our results show that functional players, which might be
          overlooked by single-gene approaches due to lacking direct
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations
          via co-expressed gene groups enhances our understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, offering a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic studies through the lens of functional genomics.

          In collaboration-based functioning, genes perform their roles within
          specific contexts. To elucidate the influence of these concerted genes
          on complex traits, a comprehensive understanding of gene expression
          regulation across varying conditions is essential for therapeutic
          development. Our study demonstrates that diseases are strongly

          Importantly, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          associations and elucidates their underlying mechanisms. In addition,
          using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we identified
          functionally vital players that lack direct genetic associations but

          contextualizes genetic findings and uncovers potential targets missed
          by singular-gene strategies. By doing so, PhenoPLIER provides a unique
          framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene module

To understand gene influence on these traits necessitates delving into expression regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding has been proven vital for therapeutic development. Our study addresses this gap by demonstrating that diseases correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By employing our approach, PhenoPLIER, we successfully predict established drug-disease connections and illuminate their mechanisms of action. To further validate its efficacy, we applied CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation and observed that functionally crucial genes lacking direct associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by integrating co-expressed gene groups, contextualizes genetic associations, highlighting targets often missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework provided by PhenoPLIER facilitates more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

          In collaboration-based functioning, genes perform their duties in
          distinct contexts. To comprehend the influence of these gene
          collaborations on complex traits, it's crucial to understand
          expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge has
          been proven vital for therapeutic advancement. Our study demonstrates
          that diseases significantly associate with gene modules expressed
          specifically in relevant cell types. Consequently, our approach excels
          at predicting existing drug-disease relationships while elucidating
          their mechanisms of action. Additionally, by analyzing lipid
          regulation via a CRISPR screen, we observed that functionally
          essential genes without direct associations are prioritized within
          trait-associated gene modules through PhenoPLIER's methodology. In
          summary, incorporating co-expressed gene clusters enables PhenoPLIER
          to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          typically overlooked by single-gene strategies. By linking genetics
          and gene module patterns, PhenoPLIER introduces a groundbreaking
          interpretative framework for genetic association analysis.

          In complex biological systems, genes collaboratively perform their
          functions in specific contexts. To comprehend gene influence on
          intricate traits, it is crucial to understand expression regulation
          across diverse conditions for developing novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a vital part in disease origin and progression. Our
          study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that
          harmonizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on gene modules exhibiting similar expression
          patterns across shared conditions. We observe significant correlations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER shows high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease
          relationships, identifying their mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          applying CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally critical genes lacking direct associations were
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding gene co-expression patterns is crucial for unraveling disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current approaches primarily focus on individual genes, neglecting the potential impact of gene-gene interactions in complex traits. Our work introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that bridges the gap by jointly analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a shared representation derived from gene modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and identifies mechanisms of action, especially in diseases associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes lacking direct associations but situated within trait-associated modules as seen in a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis. By highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER advances therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing strategies, ultimately contributing to our understanding of clustering complex traits.'

          Genes collaboratively execute their functions within specific

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' In the pursuit of unraveling complex trait genetics, understanding gene collaborations and their regulatory mechanisms across varying conditions is crucial for advancing therapeutic developments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have made significant strides in identifying individual genes'' roles in disease processes; however, modern research highlights the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified representation based on co-expression patterns among genes across shared conditions. Our method reveals that diseases are significantly linked to expression modules in relevant cell types, accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs, and elucidates mechanisms of action. When tested using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation analysis, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally essential genes with no direct trait associations, showcasing its potential to enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis and guide the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.'

          In collaboration, genes perform their functions within specific
          contexts. To comprehensively understand how these gene interactions
          influence complex traits, it is essential to delve into the mechanisms
          governing expression regulation across various conditions. Such
          insights are crucial for advancing therapeutic development.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          revealing individual genes' involvement in disease processes. However,
          contemporary perspectives on complex trait architecture highlight the
          significant role played by gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on clusters of
          genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions. We
          observe that diseases are notably associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach demonstrates high
          accuracy in predicting established drug-disease associations and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we analyze a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation and find that functionally essential
          genes, despite lacking direct associations, are prioritized within
          trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' In the quest to understand complex traits and develop innovative therapies, it is essential to explore gene interactions and their concerted actions. Expression regulation across diverse conditions offers insight into these mechanisms, but traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on individual genes'' roles in diseases. To address gene-gene interactions'' critical role in disease development, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our method reveals that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Notably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease connections and their mechanisms of action. In addition, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential genes lacking direct associations are prioritized by our approach within trait-associated modules. This innovative method therefore provides valuable insights into disease etiology and uncovers drug mechanism details, contributing significantly to the field of genetic studies and functional genomics.'

          Collaborative gene functioning is crucial for executing their roles in
          specific scenarios. To elucidate how these genes impact complex
          traits, a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
          diverse conditions is essential. This knowledge has proven
          indispensable for devising novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have successfully uncovered the role of individual
          genes in disease-related mechanisms. Nevertheless, advanced models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
          significantly contribute to the emergence and progression of diseases.
          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is constructed based on clusters of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit
          significant correlations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach exhibits high accuracy in predicting
          established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen, we
          discovered that functionally critical genes without direct
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          In the realm of complex trait research, genes operate collaboratively
          to fulfill their functions, underscoring the need for a comprehensive
          understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This
          knowledge is vital in developing innovative therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However,
          recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions hold crucial
          significance in disease etiology and progression. We address this by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across similar conditions. Our approach demonstrates strong
          association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships, and
          elucidates the mechanisms underlying these interactions. As evidence,
          using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally critical yet unassociated genes were prioritized by
          PhenoPLIER within trait-linked modules. Through this groundbreaking
          approach, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between genetic studies and
          functional genomics, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          while offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention and drug
          repurposing strategies.

          In collaboration, genes execute their functions within specific
          contexts. Unveiling the intricate influence of these gene interactions
          on complex traits necessitates a thorough understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions. This knowledge holds substantial
          significance in developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have contributed to identifying individual gene
          roles in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models
          propose that gene-gene interactions hold crucial implications for
          disease etiology and progression. Herein, we present PhenoPLIER—a
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of
          genes displaying similar expression patterns across common conditions.
          We demonstrate that diseases are substantially associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates their
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, analyzing a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          lacking direct associations, were prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of complex trait genetics, genes collaboratively execute
          their functions within specific contexts. To fully understand gene
          influences on these traits, it is crucial to grasp expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This understanding has been
          shown to be vital for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in disease
          mechanisms but overlook the potential contribution of gene-gene
          interactions. Recent advances in complex trait architecture models
          suggest that these interactions play a significant part in disease
          genesis and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and reveals action mechanisms. In a CRISPR
          screen examining lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important genes without direct associations were prioritized by
          PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules, emphasizing its capability
          to uncover overlooked genetic contributors in complex traits.

            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific
              contexts, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions to decipher their
              influence on complex traits. This insight is pivotal for therapy
              development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however,
              contemporary models suggest gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              part in disease genesis and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              gene modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across various
              conditions. Disease association with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types has been observed. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of
              action. In a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              functionally vital genes lacking associations were prioritized
              within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed through
              single-gene strategies. By interpreting genetic associations via
              gene module lens, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
              uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different

              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in

              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes operate collaboratively in specific contexts to execute
              their functional roles. To elucidate gene influence on complex
              traits, it is essential to understand expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. Such insights hold significance for therapy
              development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided
              valuable insights into genes' roles in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern approaches to complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease onset and progression. In this context, we present
              PhenoPLIER - a computational framework that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
              relies on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              across shared conditions. We observe that diseases significantly
              associate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations
              while inferring mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen studying
              lipid regulation, we find functionally significant players lack
              direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation
              of co-expressed gene groups contextualizes genetic associations
              and identifies potential targets missed using single-gene
              strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for

              Genes collaboratively execute their functions within specific
              contexts. To comprehend how these gene interactions influence
              complex traits, it is essential to understand expression
              regulation across varying conditions. This insight has proven
              crucial in developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions hold significant importance in disease
              etiology and progression. In this work, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded
              on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. We find diseases significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts established drug-disease correlations and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. By analyzing lipid regulation
              through CRISPR screening, we identify functionally important
              players that lack single-gene associations but are prioritized
              within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by

              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed in singular gene strategies. The application of PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel framework to decipher genetic associations through

               In the pursuit of understanding gene functions and their influence on complex traits, a mechanistic view of expression regulation across various conditions is essential for advancing therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data within a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across conditions. Our approach shows strong predictive accuracy for known drug-disease pairs and identifies action mechanisms. We further demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players, even in cases where single-gene strategies overlook their associations. By contextualizing genetic findings through co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER highlights potentially missed therapeutic targets and offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of functional genomics.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Gene functions often rely on collaborative efforts among
              themselves in specific contexts. Unraveling these gene influences
              on complex traits necessitates an understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions, which has proven critical
              for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial part in disease development and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is anchored on modules of
              co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We observe
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, making our approach reliable for
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and unraveling mechanisms of
              action. In addition, by utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally vital genes lacking direct
              associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, by considering groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER presents a unique framework for interpreting

               In the quest to understand complex traits and uncover novel therapeutic targets, the importance of examining genes within their regulatory context has become increasingly apparent. Existing methods focusing on individual gene-trait associations may overlook important mechanisms involved in disease development. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that combines gene-trait association data and pharmacological perturbation information into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is grounded in the concept that genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to perform their functions, making it essential to comprehend how they impact complex traits at the level of expression regulation across various conditions.

              PhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on modules comprising
              genes with similar expression patterns across distinct scenarios.
              Through our analysis, we demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, validating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating their mechanisms of action. As
              a practical application, when analyzing lipid regulation using
              CRISPR screens, we found that functionally critical genes lacking
              direct associations were prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's strategy of considering groups of
              co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization and
              interpretation of genetic associations, uncovering potentially
              overlooked targets that might have been missed in single-gene
              approaches. By incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a
              novel framework to project genetic associations through an
              enriched expression perspective, significantly advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a pioneering computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive joint analysis. The interplay between genes to accomplish their functions varies in distinct contexts. Deciphering the influence of these concerted genes on complex traits necessitates understanding expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for novel therapy development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to unveiling individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in the genesis and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's representation centers on groups of genes with comparable expression patterns across similar conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, indicating our approach's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease links and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally essential genes without direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Conclusively, incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and expose potential targets missed using single-gene approaches. By interpreting genetic connections through gene module lenses, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for advancing our understanding in genetics and disease mechanisms.

               In the quest to understand complex trait architectures and develop novel therapies, a mechanistic view of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial. Existing methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have contributed to uncovering individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, they may overlook the impact of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by jointly analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a common latent representation. 

              PhenoPLIER builds on the concept that genes function
              collaboratively in specific contexts. By identifying modules of
              co-expressed genes across shared conditions, PhenoPLIER offers a
              more comprehensive view of gene involvement in complex traits. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations while
              revealing their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, when applied to
              a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important genes lacking individual genetic
              associations, but enriched within trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, by incorporating gene co-expression patterns,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights
              potential drug targets missed in single-gene approaches. This
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic studies through the
              lens of gene expression modules advances our understanding of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to more
              effective therapeutic development.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes collaborate with one another within specific
              contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an
              understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions
              to discern how these genes influence complex traits. This insight
              has been demonstrated to be crucial in developing innovative
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided the
              discovery of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
              contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules containing
              genes with similar expression patterns across shared conditions.
              We observe that diseases exhibit significant associations with
              gene modules expressed predominantly in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR
              screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
              essential genes without direct associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's
              approach of incorporating co-expressed gene clusters
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER
              presents a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

               In the pursuit of unraveling disease etiology and elucidating drug mechanisms, we encounter the limitation of single-gene strategies in capturing complex trait contributions. The context lies in recognizing that genes function intricately within specific contexts, governed by expression regulation across different conditions. This mechanistic understanding is crucial for advancing new therapies through genetic studies and functional genomics. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data within a shared latent representation for joint analysis. 

              PhenoPLIER's core concept is based on gene modules, which exhibit
              similar expression patterns under specific conditions. Our results
              showcase significant correlations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately
              predicts established drug-disease relationships and uncovers the
              mechanisms of action. For instance, when analyzing lipid
              regulation through a CRISPR screen, PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important yet association-less genes within
              trait-associated modules. 


              In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies
              potential therapeutic targets missed by singular gene-focused
              methods. This innovative framework expands our capacity for
              interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules,
              bolstering disease understanding and drug mechanism development.

              accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs and infers

              analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally vital players
              that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by

               In the pursuit of understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a gap exists in adequately capturing gene-gene interactions and functional groups within complex traits. This context highlights the need for innovative approaches to decipher gene expression patterns across conditions. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that bridges gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data through a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating modules of genes with coordinated expression patterns in specific contexts, our approach addresses the shortcoming of relying solely on individual genes to unravel disease processes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge about gene roles in diseases, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease origins and progression.

              PhenoPLIER's representation allows for the successful
              identification of disease associations with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and uncovers mechanisms of action. In a case
              study using CRISPR to analyze lipid regulation, we observed that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally significant genes without
              direct genetic association, demonstrating its ability to fill
              critical gaps in single-gene approaches.


              In conclusion, by integrating co-expressed gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER provides a valuable perspective on interpreting genetic
              associations within the context of functional groups, advancing
              our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This
              approach offers a novel framework for linking genetics with
              expression patterns to inform therapeutic target identification
              and potentially drive drug repurposing initiatives.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. The collaborative function of genes in specific contexts is crucial for understanding their role in complex traits. This necessitates the exploration of expression regulation across varying conditions. Such insights are essential for new therapy development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal part in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is derived from groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across shared conditions, known as gene modules. We observe that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts established drug-disease pairings and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, by examining lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find functionally important players lacking single-gene associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's approach. In summary, the inclusion of co-expressed gene groups by PhenoPLIER helps contextualize genetic associations and reveals potential targets that single-gene strategies overlook. By incorporating gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in a comprehensive manner.

              In this study, we explore the collaborative nature of genes in
              executing their functions within specific contexts. To unravel the
              influence of these gene interactions on complex traits, it is
              essential to understand expression regulation across varying
              conditions. Our research underscores the significance of such
              insights for developing innovative therapeutic approaches. Our
              results demonstrate a strong association between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, emphasizing the accuracy
              of our approach in predicting established drug-disease
              relationships and discerning mechanisms of action. By employing
              CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally vital genes without apparent genetic associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER, a
              novel algorithm developed for this purpose. In summary, by
              integrating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
              genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed through
              single-gene strategies. This study introduces PhenoPLIER as a
              groundbreaking framework to interpret genetic findings within the
              lens of gene modules.

              In the field of genetic studies, unraveling the complex interplay
              among genes and their roles in various contexts is crucial for
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study
              addresses a gap in our current understanding by emphasizing the
              importance of gene co-expression patterns. The contextual
              significance lies in the fact that existing approaches often
              struggle to explain complex traits comprehensively, limiting
              progress in developing new therapies. Our method, PhenoPLIER,
              presents an innovative solution by analyzing genes within their
              functional modules instead of focusing solely on individual
              associations. Results show a strong association between diseases
              and gene expression patterns in relevant cell types. Additionally,
              PhenoPLIER excels at predicting known drug-disease relationships
              while revealing their underlying mechanisms. A CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation further supports this method as it highlights
              functionally important genes that were initially overlooked by
              single-gene approaches due to the lack of genetic associations. By
              prioritizing these genes within trait-associated modules,
              PhenoPLIER effectively contextualizes genetic findings and
              identifies missed targets. This groundbreaking framework not only
              enhances our interpretation of genetic associations but also
              underscores the potential of functional genomics in advancing
              therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

              In collaboration-based functioning, genes execute their roles in
              specific contexts. To comprehend gene influence on complex traits,
              it is essential to understand expression regulation across various
              conditions for mechanistic insights crucial in novel therapy
              development. Our study demonstrates that diseases correlate
              significantly with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              and our approach excels in predicting known drug-disease

              role in performing their specific functions. Elucidating these
              gene influences on intricate traits necessitates an in-depth
              understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions.
              This knowledge has been demonstrated to be crucial in devising
              novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases exhibit
              significant associations with gene modules predominantly expressed
              in relevant cell types. Consequently, our approach exhibits high
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease correlations and
              unraveling the mechanisms underlying these actions. Additionally,
              through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, we identified
              functionally vital genes that lack direct genetic associations but
              are highlighted within trait-associated gene modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed
              gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic findings
              and exposes potential targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. By using gene module interpretations, PhenoPLIER
              presents a unique framework to decipher complex genetic
              associations.

              In the field of genetic studies, disentangling the complex
              interactions among genes and their impact on traits requires a
              deep understanding of gene expression regulation across various
              conditions. This insight is critical for developing innovative
              therapies. Our research aims to address this gap by proposing
              PhenoPLIER, an approach that projects genetic associations through
              gene expression patterns in relevant cell types. In our study, we
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
              specific modules of co-expressed genes. Notably, our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and discerns their
              mechanisms of action. To further validate its effectiveness, we
              applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen studying lipid regulation.
              Our results show that functional players, which might be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches due to lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
              associations via co-expressed gene groups enhances our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, offering a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic studies through the lens
              of functional genomics.

              In collaboration-based functioning, genes perform their roles
              within specific contexts. To elucidate the influence of these
              concerted genes on complex traits, a comprehensive understanding
              of gene expression regulation across varying conditions is
              essential for therapeutic development. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in

              In collaboration-based functioning, genes perform their duties in
              distinct contexts. To comprehend the influence of these gene
              collaborations on complex traits, it's crucial to understand
              expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge
              has been proven vital for therapeutic advancement. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases significantly associate with gene
              modules expressed specifically in relevant cell types.
              Consequently, our approach excels at predicting existing
              drug-disease relationships while elucidating their mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, by analyzing lipid regulation via a CRISPR
              screen, we observed that functionally essential genes without
              direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated gene
              modules through PhenoPLIER's methodology. In summary,
              incorporating co-expressed gene clusters enables PhenoPLIER to
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              typically overlooked by single-gene strategies. By linking

            text: ' In the realm of genetic studies, comprehensively understanding gene functions and their interplay in complex traits remains a significant challenge. Elucidating expression regulation across diverse conditions offers crucial insights for novel therapy development. Our research introduces PhenoPLIER, an approach that establishes strong links between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Notably, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered that critical functional players often lack direct genetic associations but can be identified through PhenoPLIER''s prioritization within trait-associated gene modules. By incorporating co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic findings and uncovers targets typically missed by single-gene strategies. As a result, PhenoPLIER represents a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, significantly contributing to advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In complex biological systems, genes collaboratively perform their
              functions in specific contexts. To comprehend gene influence on
              intricate traits, it is crucial to understand expression
              regulation across diverse conditions for developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
              on individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a vital part in disease origin and
              progression. Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that harmonizes gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              gene modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across shared
              conditions. We observe significant correlations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              shows high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease
              relationships, identifying their mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, applying CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally critical genes lacking
              direct associations were prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes collaboratively execute their functions within specific
              contexts, underscoring the necessity of understanding gene
              interactions to elucidate complex trait influences. The
              significance of this regulatory insight in advancing novel
              therapies has been established. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have facilitated identifying individual genes' roles in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in disease etiology
              and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation depends on groups of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across various conditions.
              We observe that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts established drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, analyzing lipid regulation via a CRISPR
              screen, we find that functionally critical genes without explicit
              associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

            text: ' In the pursuit of unraveling complex trait genetics, understanding gene collaborations and their regulatory mechanisms across varying conditions is crucial for advancing therapeutic developments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have made significant strides in identifying individual genes'' roles in disease processes; however, modern research highlights the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified representation based on co-expression patterns among genes across shared conditions. Our method reveals that diseases are significantly linked to expression modules in relevant cell types, accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs, and elucidates mechanisms of action. When tested using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation analysis, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally essential genes with no direct trait associations, showcasing its potential to enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis and guide the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.'

              In collaboration, genes perform their functions within specific
              contexts. To comprehensively understand how these gene
              interactions influence complex traits, it is essential to delve
              into the mechanisms governing expression regulation across various
              conditions. Such insights are crucial for advancing therapeutic
              development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in revealing individual genes' involvement in disease
              processes. However, contemporary perspectives on complex trait
              architecture highlight the significant role played by gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and progression. In this study,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is grounded on clusters of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns across conditions. We observe that diseases
              are notably associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting
              established drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, we analyze a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation and find that functionally essential genes, despite
              lacking direct associations, are prioritized within
              trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.

            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Collaborative gene functioning is crucial for executing their
              roles in specific scenarios. To elucidate how these genes impact
              complex traits, a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions is essential. This knowledge
              has proven indispensable for devising novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered
              the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
              Nevertheless, advanced models of complex trait architecture
              suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to
              the emergence and progression of diseases. We present PhenoPLIER,
              a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              constructed based on clusters of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases
              exhibit significant correlations with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach exhibits high accuracy in
              predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation through a
              CRISPR screen, we discovered that functionally critical genes
              without direct associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the realm of complex trait research, genes operate
              collaboratively to fulfill their functions, underscoring the need
              for a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital in developing
              innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              been instrumental in identifying individual gene roles in disease
              mechanisms. However, recent models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions hold crucial significance in disease etiology and
              progression. We address this by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              similar conditions. Our approach demonstrates strong association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships, and
              elucidates the mechanisms underlying these interactions. As
              evidence, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally critical yet unassociated genes were
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-linked modules. Through
              this groundbreaking approach, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap between
              genetic studies and functional genomics, highlighting disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms while offering potential targets for
              therapeutic intervention and drug repurposing strategies.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In collaboration, genes execute their functions within specific
              contexts. Unveiling the intricate influence of these gene
              interactions on complex traits necessitates a thorough
              understanding of expression regulation across various conditions.
              This knowledge holds substantial significance in developing novel
              therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              contributed to identifying individual gene roles in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose
              that gene-gene interactions hold crucial implications for disease
              etiology and progression. Herein, we present PhenoPLIER—a
              computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded
              in modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across
              common conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are substantially
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs
              and elucidates their mechanisms of action. Additionally, analyzing
              a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally significant players, lacking direct associations,
              were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of complex trait genetics, genes collaboratively
              execute their functions within specific contexts. To fully
              understand gene influences on these traits, it is crucial to grasp
              expression regulation across varying conditions. This
              understanding has been shown to be vital for developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms but overlook the
              potential contribution of gene-gene interactions. Recent advances
              in complex trait architecture models suggest that these
              interactions play a significant part in disease genesis and
              progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions.
              Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals action
              mechanisms. In a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we
              found that functionally important genes without direct
              associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated modules, emphasizing its capability to uncover
              overlooked genetic contributors in complex traits.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
