In this study, we aim to bridge the gap between genetic associations and functional genomics to uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex traits. By integrating transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) with pharmacological perturbation data, we develop a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER. This method maps gene-trait associations to modules of co-expressed genes in relevant cell types, revealing the functional context of genetic variations. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding these interactions is crucial for developing new therapies. Recent studies have shown that transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) can identify individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in complex trait etiology. PhenoPLIER represents genes based on their expression patterns across different conditions, and we find that diseases are significantly associated with modules of co-expressed genes expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action, and when applied to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations but enriched in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Genes collaborate to perform specific functions in various settings, influencing complex traits. Unveiling how these genes contribute to disease requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under different conditions, which is crucial for developing novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and reveals mechanisms of action. By conducting a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules identified by PhenoPLIER. In essence, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations, revealing potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by examining gene modules through the lens of their co-expression patterns.

In this study, we aim to fill the gap in our understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits, by leveraging functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings have broader significance for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits, highlighting the importance of considering gene modules in genetic association studies.

In the context of genetic studies, functional genomics, and drug discovery, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather in concert with each other to influence complex traits. However, current methods for identifying genetic associations often focus on individual genes or variants without considering their broader genomic context. This can lead to a incomplete understanding of the underlying biology and miss potential therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying new therapeutic targets.

Our approach uses a combination of gene expression profiling and network analysis to identify groups of co-expressed genes that are associated with specific traits. By prioritizing these modules in our analysis, we find that they are more accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action than single-gene approaches. Additionally, through the CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering gene modules in genetic association studies and provide a novel framework for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

In conclusion, our results demonstrate the power of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic association studies to reveal new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of the underlying biology. By providing a more comprehensive framework for interpreting genetic associations, PhenoPLIER has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and personalized medicine.

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings have broader significance for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits, highlighting the importance of considering gene modules in genetic association studies.

In the context of genetic studies, functional genomics, and drug discovery, there is a growing recognition that genes do not act in isolation but rather in concert with each other to influence complex traits. However, current methods for identifying genetic associations often focus on individual genes or variants without considering their broader genomic context. This can lead to a incomplete understanding of the underlying biology and miss potential therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying new therapeutic targets.

Our approach uses a combination of gene expression profiling and network analysis to identify groups of co-expressed genes that are associated with specific traits. By prioritizing these modules in our analysis, we find that they are more accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action than single-gene approaches. Additionally, through the CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering gene modules in genetic association studies and provide a novel framework for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

In conclusion, our results demonstrate the power of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic association studies to reveal new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of the underlying biology. By providing a more comprehensive framework for interpreting genetic associations, PhenoPLIER has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and personalized medicine.

Genes collaborate to perform specific functions in various contexts, and understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a deep appreciation of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is essential for developing effective therapies, as highlighted by transcriptome-wide association studies that uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of complex traits. To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types.

Notes on the revisions:

1. Simplified sentence structure: The original abstract contains long, complex sentences that can be difficult to follow. I&#39;ve revised these sentences to make them simpler and easier to understand.
2. Improved clarity: Some of the phrases in the original abstract are a bit ambiguous or unclear. I&#39;ve tried to clarify these phrases to improve the overall readability of the text.
3. Consistent terminology: The original abstract uses different terms (e.g., &quot;disease-relevant mechanisms&quot; vs. &quot;complex traits&quot;) to refer to the same concept. To avoid confusion, I&#39;ve standardized the terminology throughout the revised paragraph.
4. Emphasis on key findings: To make the abstract more impactful, I&#39;ve emphasized the most significant results of the study, such as the identification of functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

The context: In the field of genetic studies, there is a pressing need to understand how genes interact with each other to influence complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes associated with disease risk, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Despite this knowledge gap, there is limited understanding of how these interactions occur and how they can be targeted for therapeutic intervention.

Content: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to identify gene-trait associations. Our approach uses modules of genes with similar expression profiles across different conditions to reveal underlying disease mechanisms. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations but enriched in trait-associated modules.

Conclusion: Our results provide a novel approach for projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting the importance of understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By integrating transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex diseases. Our findings have broader significance for the field of functional genomics, as they demonstrate the potential of integrative approaches to uncover novel disease mechanisms and inform personalized medicine strategies.
