          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to

      response:
        output: ' Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts. To elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is essential to understand the regulation of gene expression across different conditions. This understanding plays a critical role in developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have demonstrated the importance of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern architectural models for complex traits emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in shaping diseases. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that utilizes a common latent representation derived from gene expression patterns across different conditions and conditions. This framework unifies gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and modules of co-expressed genes. By analyzing diseases'' significant associations with relevant gene expression modules, PhenoPLIER exhibits accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and the mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. Overall, PhenoPLIER''s incorporation of gene expression patterns provides a novel approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can potentially uncover missed targets and contribute to drug repurposing strategies in therapeutic development.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we observe that important players not linked to associations by themselves are prioritized in trait-associated modules due to their inclusion in the grouped co-expressed gene structure. In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets often missed when focusing on single genes. PhenoPLIER introduces a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates an exploration of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to deciphering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the etiology and progression of diseases. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation facilitating joint analysis. This representation is founded on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we find that functionally crucial players lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the potential targets missed in single-gene strategies. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and shedding light on previously unrecognized drug mechanisms and targets.'

Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, leveraging modules of co-expressed genes across conditions. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Utilizing CRISPR to analyze lipid regulation, we find functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion, through integrating co-expressed genes into the analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and can reveal overlooked therapeutic targets typically missed by single-gene strategies, thus providing a novel framework for interpreting complex trait architecture.'

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for analyzing genetic associations and drug mechanisms by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates an insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing new therapies, particularly for complex diseases with multifactorial origins and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to unraveling the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in shaping these processes.

          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across similar conditions. We observe that diseases are strongly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and
          demonstrate high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs as
          well as understanding mechanisms of action. Furthermore, applying a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that important players
          lacking direct associations with traits were prioritized by PhenoPLIER
          due to their membership in trait-associated gene modules.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of co-expressed genes
          to provide a unique perspective on genetic associations and reveals
          potential targets that could be missed using single-gene strategies.
          By utilizing this novel framework, PhenoPLIER offers insights into the
          understanding of disease etiology, therapeutic development, and drug
          repurposing for complex traits.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding how genes cooperate in specific contexts to perform their functions is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms behind complex traits, particularly in disease development and therapeutic discovery. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual gene contributions to diseases, modern models of complex traits emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules formed by genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. By analyzing its results, we observe that gene modules associated with specific diseases are expressed in relevant cell types and can predict known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen of lipid regulation, we find functional players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic association analysis allows for the discovery of overlooked potential targets that might be missed using single-gene strategies and offers a new framework for interpreting genetic data through gene modules.'

      response:
        output: ' Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that connects gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, aims to enhance our understanding of the role genes play in complex traits. As genes collaborate to carry out their functions under specific contexts, determining their influence on complex diseases necessitates comprehending expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have highlighted the impact of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER''s approach is based on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across shared conditions. Our research demonstrates diseases are notably associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and the technique accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while revealing mechanisms of action. Additionally, we observed that a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed functional players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER helps contextualize genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' This study presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By understanding how genes cooperate to perform their functions across various conditions, we gain insight into complex traits'' influence on disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related processes; however, models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. We found diseases to be linked to relevant gene modules expressed in specific cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease connections and mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen study on lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally crucial players lacking direct associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-related gene modules. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and potentially identify overlooked targets in single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thus advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

           We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function together in specific contexts to execute their tasks, necessitating understanding of how these genes influence complex traits by exploring the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing new therapies, particularly considering that recent models suggest gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in discovering individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, but they alone don't account for the impact of gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER is based on modules consisting of co-expressed genes under similar conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly linked to these gene modules relevant to specific cell types and can predict drug-disease associations effectively, along with inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find functionally critical players not associated with traits but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-related modules.

          In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          enables contextualizing genetic associations and helps identify
          potential targets that may be missed through single-gene strategies.
          This novel framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic
          associations via gene module analysis, thus advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

To understand how genes influence complex traits, their expression regulation across various contexts must be examined. This insight is critical for developing novel therapeutics.

We find that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while elucidating mechanisms of action.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

        output: ' This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for analysis. The approach focuses on gene expression patterns across different conditions to better understand complex traits and their influence on diseases. Traditional transcriptome studies have mainly focused on individual genes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play significant roles in disease etiology. By representing genes based on their expression patterns under similar conditions, PhenoPLIER shows that diseases are associated with modules of co-expressed genes relevant to the affected tissues. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, functionally important players that lack single-gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for understanding genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes and reveals potential targets that might otherwise be missed by single-gene approaches.'

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes collaborate with one another to carry out their functions in specific contexts, affecting complex traits. Understanding expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, particularly as it relates to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we found that gene modules related to relevant cell types are significantly associated with diseases and can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs along with their modes of action. Using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players that lack associations but become prioritized in trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER. By integrating co-expressed genes into the analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and sheds light on targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, this novel framework offers a unique perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which may advance our understanding of complex diseases and guide drug development.'

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes function interdependently in various contexts to carry out their tasks, necessitating an understanding of how they collectively regulate gene expression across different conditions for deciphering the underlying mechanisms behind complex traits. This comprehension plays a crucial role in developing novel therapeutic interventions. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases exhibit strong associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We have also validated our approach''s ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate the mechanisms of action involved. Through CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that while functionally important genes might not have direct genetic associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER due to their co-expression patterns. In conclusion, utilizing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules and could potentially reveal overlooked targets that may have been missed through single-gene strategies. This novel approach brings forth a unique methodology to bridge the gap between genetics and functional genomics by highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for better therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing options.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes collaborate within specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation in various conditions. Such knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an algorithmic approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

        output: ' Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, influencing complex traits through expression regulation. Understanding the role of gene expression is crucial for developing new therapies, particularly in light of modern models predicting that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression. Existing methods, like transcriptome-wide association studies, have helped identify individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms; however, they don''t consider the impact of gene expression patterns across various conditions. To address these gaps, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis based on co-expression modules. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene expression patterns in relevant cell types and can accurately predict drug-disease connections. Additionally, through CRISPR screening of lipid regulation, we found that players without direct trait associations could be prioritized by PhenoPLIER when included in trait-associated modules due to their functional importance. This highlights the significance of this method for gaining insight into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions

          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

            text: ' Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts. To elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is essential to understand the regulation of gene expression across different conditions. This understanding plays a critical role in developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have demonstrated the importance of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern architectural models for complex traits emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in shaping diseases. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that utilizes a common latent representation derived from gene expression patterns across different conditions and conditions. This framework unifies gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and modules of co-expressed genes. By analyzing diseases'' significant associations with relevant gene expression modules, PhenoPLIER exhibits accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and the mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. Overall, PhenoPLIER''s incorporation of gene expression patterns provides a novel approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can potentially uncover missed targets and contribute to drug repurposing strategies in therapeutic development.'

               Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, which greatly influences the development of complex traits. However, understanding how these genes impact disease progression requires insight into gene expression regulation under different conditions. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable information on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, but the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait development is still not fully understood. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. It identifies modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions to provide a contextual understanding of genetic associations. By doing so, PhenoPLIER successfully associates diseases with gene expression patterns in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action, as well as prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are present in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially revealing overlooked therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate to perform their functions under specific contexts. Elucidating how these genes influence complex traits necessitates understanding gene expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies and gaining a comprehensive view of disease etiology. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play key roles in disease origin and progression. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that maps genetic associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By using modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions as the basis, PhenoPLIER demonstrates significant association with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs. Our results also indicate that functional players lacking direct associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER due to their involvement in trait-associated gene expression modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER integrates co-expressed genes into a framework for interpreting genetic associations and offers an approach that could potentially reveal overlooked therapeutic targets when compared to single-gene strategies.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into the regulation of expression across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital to the origin and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, revealing that diseases are significantly associated with these modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack direct association but were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. Our results demonstrate the ability of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations using groups of co-expressed genes and uncover potential targets missed through single-gene approaches. In essence, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by considering gene expression patterns, which can provide deeper insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. We recognize the importance of understanding how genes collaborate to influence complex traits, with an emphasis on their expression regulation across various conditions. The development of effective therapies relies on this insight. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in driving diseases and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts drug-disease pairs, deciphers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes crucial players in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for analyzing genetic associations and drug mechanisms by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates an insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing new therapies, particularly for complex diseases with multifactorial origins and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to unraveling the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in shaping these processes.

              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across similar conditions. We observe that diseases are
              strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types and demonstrate high accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs as well as understanding mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, applying a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
              find that important players lacking direct associations with
              traits were prioritized by PhenoPLIER due to their membership in
              trait-associated gene modules.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of co-expressed
              genes to provide a unique perspective on genetic associations and
              reveals potential targets that could be missed using single-gene
              strategies. By utilizing this novel framework, PhenoPLIER offers
              insights into the understanding of disease etiology, therapeutic
              development, and drug repurposing for complex traits.

               This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding how genes cooperate in specific contexts to perform their functions is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms behind complex traits, particularly in disease development and therapeutic discovery. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully identified individual gene contributions to diseases, modern models of complex traits emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules formed by genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. By analyzing its results, we observe that gene modules associated with specific diseases are expressed in relevant cell types and can predict known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen of lipid regulation, we find functional players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic association analysis allows for the discovery of overlooked potential targets that might be missed using single-gene strategies and offers a new framework for interpreting genetic data through gene modules.

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is

               Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that connects gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, aims to enhance our understanding of the role genes play in complex traits. As genes collaborate to carry out their functions under specific contexts, determining their influence on complex diseases necessitates comprehending expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have highlighted the impact of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across shared conditions. Our research demonstrates diseases are notably associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and the technique accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while revealing mechanisms of action. Additionally, we observed that a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed functional players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER helps contextualize genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               This study presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By understanding how genes cooperate to perform their functions across various conditions, we gain insight into complex traits' influence on disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related processes; however, models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. We found diseases to be linked to relevant gene modules expressed in specific cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease connections and mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen study on lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally crucial players lacking direct associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-related gene modules. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and potentially identify overlooked targets in single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thus advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate intricately to execute their functions, necessitating an understanding of their role in influencing complex traits through expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies and uncovering disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have enabled the discovery of individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, termed "gene modules." We observe that diseases are significantly related to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals the mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our approach allows for contextualizing genetic associations and identifying potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and their functional role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function together in specific contexts to execute their tasks, necessitating understanding of how these genes influence complex traits by exploring the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing new therapies, particularly considering that recent models suggest gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in discovering individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, but they alone don't account for the impact of gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER is based on modules consisting of co-expressed genes under similar conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly linked to these gene modules relevant to specific cell types and can predict drug-disease associations effectively, along with inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find functionally critical players not associated with traits but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-related modules.

              In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER enables contextualizing genetic associations and helps
              identify potential targets that may be missed through single-gene
              strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for
              interpreting genetic associations via gene module analysis, thus
              advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. To understand how genes influence complex traits, their expression regulation across various contexts must be examined. This insight is critical for developing novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, it is recognized that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while elucidating mechanisms of action. In addition, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we observed that functionally vital genes without direct trait associations were prioritized within PhenoPLIER's gene-associated modules. Ultimately, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for analysis. The approach focuses on gene expression patterns across different conditions to better understand complex traits and their influence on diseases. Traditional transcriptome studies have mainly focused on individual genes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play significant roles in disease etiology. By representing genes based on their expression patterns under similar conditions, PhenoPLIER shows that diseases are associated with modules of co-expressed genes relevant to the affected tissues. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, functionally important players that lack single-gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for understanding genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes and reveals potential targets that might otherwise be missed by single-gene approaches.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these gene interactions impact complex traits requires knowledge of expression regulation across various conditions. This is essential for developing effective therapies. Our study revealed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important genes lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER enables us to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This framework offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Genes collaborate with one another to carry out their functions in specific contexts, affecting complex traits. Understanding expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, particularly as it relates to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we found that gene modules related to relevant cell types are significantly associated with diseases and can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs along with their modes of action. Using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players that lack associations but become prioritized in trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER. By integrating co-expressed genes into the analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and sheds light on targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, this novel framework offers a unique perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which may advance our understanding of complex diseases and guide drug development.

               Genes work cooperatively within specific contexts to perform their functions, and unraveling their impact on complex traits necessitates understanding expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for creating novel therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while identifying mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we observe that functionally significant players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed using single-gene strategies. As a novel framework, PhenoPLIER enables the interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enriching our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes function in collaboration with each other to perform their duties within specific contexts, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for deciphering complex traits. This mechanistic knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. The present study demonstrates that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover previously overlooked targets. This novel framework offers a unique approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and sheds light on therapeutic targets often missed by single-gene strategies.

               Genes function cooperatively to execute their tasks within specific contexts, leading to the understanding that determining their influence on complex traits necessitates a profound grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrated that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease associations and uncovers mechanisms of action. Through utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we identified that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Through the novel framework of PhenoPLIER, genetic associations are interpreted in a broader perspective encompassing gene modules.

Determining how genes influence these traits is crucial for developing novel therapies. In this study, we show that diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation reveals functionally important players without current associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes function interdependently in various contexts to carry out their tasks, necessitating an understanding of how they collectively regulate gene expression across different conditions for deciphering the underlying mechanisms behind complex traits. This comprehension plays a crucial role in developing novel therapeutic interventions. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases exhibit strong associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We have also validated our approach's ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate the mechanisms of action involved. Through CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that while functionally important genes might not have direct genetic associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER due to their co-expression patterns. In conclusion, utilizing groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules and could potentially reveal overlooked targets that may have been missed through single-gene strategies. This novel approach brings forth a unique methodology to bridge the gap between genetics and functional genomics by highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for better therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing options.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, affecting complex traits. Determining the influence of these genes necessitates a deep understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases exhibit strong associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and can accurately predict drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we found that functionally vital players without known genetic associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules due to co-expression analysis. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates gene module expression data, providing an innovative approach for contextualizing genetic associations and potentially identifying overlooked therapeutic targets through a grouped gene strategy.

               Genes collaborate within specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation in various conditions. Such knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an algorithmic approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits demands an examination of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the etiology and progression of diseases. To address these limitations, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and shared expression patterns into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach allows us to identify disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, it can infer mechanisms of action and prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are part of trait-associated modules.

A thorough comprehension of the regulation of expression across different conditions is crucial for understanding how these genes impact such traits. This understanding is vital for developing novel therapies. Previous research has utilized transcriptome-wide association studies to elucidate individual gene roles in disease-associated mechanisms, but current models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly affect the genesis and progression of diseases. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool, which employs a shared latent representation connecting gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for joint analysis.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover that essential players, without direct associations, get prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the significance of this approach in deciphering disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms.'

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, influencing the manifestation of complex traits. Deciphering how these genes regulate expression under different conditions is crucial for comprehending disease mechanisms and developing novel treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual gene roles in disease processes. However, models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital to understanding disease origins and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that merges gene-trait associations, pharmacological data, and gene expression patterns into a common representation for joint analysis. This approach uses modules of similarity in gene expression patterns across conditions, connecting diseases with relevant cell types and accurately predicting drug-disease pairs while highlighting important but unassociated players within trait-related modules.

            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes

            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes collaborate with one another in specific circumstances to execute their functions. Deciphering how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in unveiling the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, recent models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers their mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital in explaining disease origins and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and a shared latent representation for gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. This allows us to identify diseases significantly associated with relevant cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen, we observe that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules even though they lack direct associations. This supports the broader significance of our approach for elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms through gene expression patterns.'

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
