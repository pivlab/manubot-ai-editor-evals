Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": "Genes collaboratively perform their functions within specific contexts, emphasizing the need for understanding expression regulation across diverse conditions to elucidate gene influences on complex traits. This perspective is crucial in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture underscore the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease onset and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIERâ€”a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and gene expression patterns into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed predominantly in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations while inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we observe that functionally critical genes without direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Unraveling expression regulation across diverse conditions is pivotal for advancing therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to deciphering individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, yet contemporary complex trait models highlight the significance of gene-gene interactions in diseases' origin and progression.

However, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

To comprehend how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to understand expression regulation across varying conditions. This understanding is vital for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary perspectives on complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease genesis and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method to correlate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discovered that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

This insight holds immense significance for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to identifying individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nonetheless, modern complex trait models emphasize the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in diseases' origin and progression.

This representation is grounded in modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach reveals significant disease association with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease connections while inferring mechanisms of action. We demonstrated PhenoPLIER's ability to uncover functional players lacking associations when applied to a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, as these genes are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. Consequently, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in contextualizing genetic associations and identifies potential overlooked targets from single-gene strategies. Through its unique approach, PhenoPLIER offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through gene modules' lens."

To comprehend the influence of genes on complex traits, it is essential to understand gene regulation across varying conditions. This insight has been shown to be pivotal in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical part in disease onset and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across shared conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. In addition, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups contextualizes genetic associations and unveils potential targets often missed in single-gene strategies. As a result, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Expression regulation across diverse conditions sheds light on how genes collaborate to perform their functions. This knowledge has significant implications for therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have highlighted individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease pathogenesis.\n\nWe present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to bridge gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data using a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across conditions. Our approach allows us to observe that diseases correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and their mechanisms of action. We further demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation: functionally critical genes lacking direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene modules contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetics through the lens of gene modules, our method can advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately benefiting therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Exploring gene influence on these traits necessitates a mechanistic perspective of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight has been proven vital for developing novel therapies. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the individual gene's part in disease mechanisms, yet modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a substantial role in disease origins and progressions. \n\nWe present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action. When analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we observed that functionally important players, absent from single-gene associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. \n\nIn conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets often overlooked in single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework that interprets genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER has significant implications for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. The collaborative functioning of genes within specific contexts is crucial to understand complex trait influences. Elucidating expression regulation across varying conditions enhances this insight, which has proven significant in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the identification of individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest gene-gene interactions are essential in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER utilizes representations based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We discovered that diseases display significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action. In addition, when analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identified functionally crucial genes lacking direct associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. Consequently, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the pursuit of understanding complex traits and identifying drug mechanisms, investigating gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations has emerged as a critical endeavor. Genes function in coordination, often within specific contexts, necessitating an appreciation of their expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are central to disease development.\n\nTo address this need, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Its representation is grounded in gene modules, where genes with similar expression patterns across conditions are clustered together. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates drug mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes, even if they lack direct genetic associations. By incorporating co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic findings and reveals missed potential therapeutic targets often neglected by single-gene strategies. Through this innovative framework, PhenoPLIER enhances our ability to interpret genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, ultimately contributing significantly to unraveling disease etiology and elucidating drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the pursuit of understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, we often face limitations in deciphering complex traits' architectures. Genes typically function cooperatively in specific contexts, emphasizing the need for insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This comprehension is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in revealing individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms through genetic associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a substantial part in disease development and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, to address this gap. It maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on co-expression modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with module-expressed genes in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Additionally, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important yet genetically unassociated players by identifying them within trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through co-expression groups, PhenoPLIER enhances single-gene strategies and offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic data via gene module analysis."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the pursuit of elucidating disease etiology and unraveling drug mechanisms, a gap remains in comprehensively understanding gene-trait associations and their interplay with pharmacological perturbations. Genes often function collaboratively in specific contexts, emphasizing the need for insights into expression regulation across different conditions for precise characterization of their influence on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest gene-gene interactions play a significant role in diseases' origins and progression.\n\nTo fill this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Its representation is based on gene modules showing similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types; PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players, not strongly genetically associated, were prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules offers a unique perspective in the study of complex traits and reveals potential targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. By combining gene expression patterns with genetic studies, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetics, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms through functional genomics."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " In the quest to understand complex traits and identify effective therapeutic targets, investigating gene-gene interactions and expression patterns is vital for drug development. Existing methods like transcriptome-wide association studies often focus on individual genes, yet contemporary models emphasize the significance of interlinked gene activities in disease etiology. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. \n\nAt its core, PhenoPLIER relies on the understanding that genes work collaboratively within specific contexts to perform their functions. To decipher how these concerted actions influence complex traits, it's crucial to comprehend expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing innovative therapies. \n\nPhenoPLIER represents gene interactions based on modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, making PhenoPLIER accurate at predicting known drug-disease associations and revealing their underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation highlights that essential players, which often lack individual genetic associations, can be prioritized through the group-level strategy employed by PhenoPLIER. \n\nIn conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable perspective for contextualizing genetic associations and identifying targets potentially overlooked in single-gene approaches. By integrating gene modules, PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic findings to advance our understanding of complex traits and accelerate drug discovery."

Genes operate collaboratively in specific contexts to perform their functional tasks. Deciphering how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which has proven crucial in developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the etiology of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease genesis and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on clusters of genes demonstrating similar expression patterns across conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed within relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and discerns mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we observe that functionally vital genes without direct associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets often overlooked by single-gene strategies. By doing so, PhenoPLIER provides a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " In the pursuit of understanding complex traits and identifying therapeutic targets, we address the gap in modeling gene-gene interactions and their mechanisms. The context lies at the intersection of genetic studies and functional genomics, where traditional methods often overlook essential insights within gene co-expression patterns. PhenoPLIER is our solution: a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data using a shared latent representation for joint analysis. As genes function in coordination, deciphering their influence on complex traits necessitates understanding expression regulation across varying conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have exposed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models assert that genetic interactions play a vital part in disease emergence and progression. \n\nThe content of our approach centers around PhenoPLIER's representation based on modules formed by genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We observed significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, leading to accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. In a case study using CRISPR screens for lipid regulation analysis, we found that functionally important players, despite lacking single-gene associations, were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. \n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and unveils potential targets missed by singular gene strategies. This innovative framework, provided by PhenoPLIER, enables the interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, significantly contributing to the fields of therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing."

To understand how these gene interactions influence complex traits, it is crucial to grasp their regulatory mechanisms across various conditions. Our research highlights the significance of such insights for developing novel therapies. We demonstrate that our results showcase a strong association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Notably, our approach proves accurate in predicting established drug-disease correlations while discerning their underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, when analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, we identified functionally critical genes that lack direct genetic associations. However, these genes are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules through our PhenoPLIER methodology. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that could be overlooked using single-gene approaches. Through this novel framework, PhenoPLIER offers a unique perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This study addresses this gap by highlighting the significance of gene modules in disease etiology and drug mechanism elucidation. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene expressions in relevant cell types, and our PhenoPLIER approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while revealing their underlying mechanisms. We further validate this approach by analyzing lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen. Importantly, genes critical for function might not exhibit single-gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies targets potentially overlooked by singular approaches. In doing so, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetics through the lens of functional genomics and gene expression patterns, contributing to advancements in drug repurposing and clustering complex traits studies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.

Investigating gene expression regulation across various conditions offers insight essential for advancing therapeutic developments. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Through our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, we accurately predict known drug-disease relationships and elucidate their mechanisms of action. As evidence, our CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed functional players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By contextualizing genetic associations using co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework not only interprets genetic associations but also facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions and their implications for the development of novel therapeutics."

To elucidate how these gene interactions contribute to complex traits, it is essential to grasp the regulatory mechanisms governing expression patterns across various conditions. This knowledge has been demonstrated as crucial for devising novel therapeutic interventions. Our study's results indicate a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We have developed an accurate method for predicting existing drug-disease connections, while also inferring the underlying mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observed that functionally critical genes, despite lacking direct genetic associations, are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by our PhenoPLIER approach.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This insight has proven crucial in developing novel therapies. Our study addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, an approach that projects genetic associations via gene expression patterns. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen on lipid regulation further highlights the significance of functionally important genes, often overlooked by single-gene strategies due to their absence in association studies. Through grouping co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, revealing targets missed by conventional methods. By integrating gene modules into interpreting genetics, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of disease etiology and expands therapeutic target discovery."

To elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, a deep understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions is crucial for therapeutic advancement. Our study demonstrates that diseases correlate significantly with gene modules expressed within relevant cell types. Employing our novel approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease associations and delineate their mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes, despite lacking direct associations, are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules through PhenoPLIER. Thus, by incorporating co-expressed gene clusters, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic links and uncovers targets previously evaded by single-gene strategies. Consequently, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetics via an integrative lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.

          "output": " In the pursuit of understanding gene functions in complex traits, unraveling their collaborative behavior is crucial across diverse contexts. This necessitates a thorough investigation into expression regulation under various conditions to facilitate novel therapeutic development. Our study presents PhenoPLIER, an approach that demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types. It exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen applied to lipid regulation further validated the approach: genes with substantial functional importance were not directly associated but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that considering groups of co-expressed genes enhances genetic association interpretation and reveals targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating gene module information, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for deciphering genetic associations in the context of functional genomics."

To comprehend the influence of these gene interactions on complex traits, it is crucial to understand how expression regulation varies across diverse conditions. Studies have demonstrated that such insights are pivotal in advancing novel therapeutics. Our findings reveal that diseases significantly correlate with modules consisting of genes expressed predominantly in relevant cell types. Our method proves accurate in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Through the application of CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential players typically lack genetic association but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, through its incorporation of co-expressed genes, contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. By linking genetics with gene module analysis, PhenoPLIER presents an innovative framework for interpreting complex genetic relationships."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Understanding gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for unraveling these intricate relationships and developing effective therapies. Our research addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that highlights the significance of diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating their mechanisms, PhenoPLIER demonstrates its effectiveness. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we found that crucial functional players without direct genetic associations were prioritized through PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion, by aggregating co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This method offers a transformative framework for interpreting complex genetic associations through the lens of gene module analysis."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In investigating the intricate relationship between genes and complex traits, it is crucial to understand their expression regulation across various conditions for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in identifying individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an essential part in disease onset and progression. We address this by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data within a shared latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules across similar conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with relevant cell type-specific gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while deciphering drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that crucial yet unassociated functional players are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-related gene modules. Through this approach, we fill the gap in elucidating gene interactions and their impact on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and informing therapeutic target selection for drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Traditional approaches focus on individual genes identified through transcriptome-wide association studies, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in diseases. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared representation based on genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We demonstrate that this approach links diseases to gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and uncovers drug mechanisms. Additionally, through the analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screen, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes lacking direct associations but situated within trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of disease origins and progression while aiding in drug discovery efforts by identifying new therapeutic targets through gene expression patterns."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In complex trait analysis, genes collaborate to execute their functions within specific contexts, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions for unraveling their influence. This insight is crucial in developing novel therapies, as demonstrated by previous research. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models highlight the significant impact of gene-gene interactions on disease etiology. To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers mechanisms of action. In a case study using CRISPR to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally critical genes without direct associations were prioritized by our method within trait-associated modules. Through this approach, PhenoPLIER offers novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing."

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

          "output": "In collaboration, genes carry out their functions within specific contexts. To elucidate the influence of these gene interactions on complex traits, a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential for advancing therapeutic developments. This insight has been substantiated in previous studies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture indicate that gene-gene interactions play a critical part in disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data within a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings reveal significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations, shedding light on mechanisms of action. In addition, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identify functionally vital genes lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by our approach."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "In collaboration, genes carry out their functions within specific contexts. Understanding these gene interactions is crucial for deciphering their influence on complex traits and developing novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms. However, recent models propose that gene-gene interactions substantially contribute to diseases' etiology and progression. Herein, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational approach for integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified representation based on gene modules sharing analogous expression patterns across various conditions. We found that diseases exhibit significant correlations with gene modules predominantly expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, applying CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant genes, which lack direct associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the quest to understand complex traits, genes' collaborative functioning within specific contexts emerges as crucial. Discovering how these concerted gene actions influence such traits necessitates unraveling expression regulation across distinct conditions. This knowledge is vital for advancing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, yet modern complex trait models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease development. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared expression pattern representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules containing genes with similar expressions across various conditions. Our results show significant connections between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing their mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen study on lipid regulation demonstrates that although functionally essential but non-associated genes are often overlooked, they can be prioritized within trait-linked modules by our approach. PhenoPLIER addresses a gap in understanding gene interactions and improves the prediction and interpretation of drug mechanisms for complex traits, thus advancing therapeutic strategies."

This comprehension is crucial for advancing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been useful in identifying individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, recent research suggests that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in disease etiology. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of coherently expressed genes across conditions. Our approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease links, and elucidates mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential genes without direct associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Consequently, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potentially overlooked targets in single-gene strategies. By interpreting genetic links through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to enhance our understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic target discovery.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This insight holds immense significance for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to identifying individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nonetheless, modern complex trait models emphasize the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in diseases' origin and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach reveals significant disease association with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease connections while inferring mechanisms of action. We demonstrated PhenoPLIER's ability to uncover functional players lacking associations when applied to a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, as these genes are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. Consequently, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in contextualizing genetic associations and identifies potential overlooked targets from single-gene strategies. Through its unique approach, PhenoPLIER offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through gene modules' lens.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Expression regulation across diverse conditions sheds light on how genes collaborate to perform their functions. This knowledge has significant implications for therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have highlighted individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease pathogenesis.\n\nWe present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology designed to bridge gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data using a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across conditions. Our approach allows us to observe that diseases correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and their mechanisms of action. We further demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation: functionally critical genes lacking direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene modules contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetics through the lens of gene modules, our method can advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately benefiting therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing efforts.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Exploring gene influence on these traits necessitates a mechanistic perspective of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight has been proven vital for developing novel therapies. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the individual gene's part in disease mechanisms, yet modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a substantial role in disease origins and progressions. \n\nWe present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action. When analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we observed that functionally important players, absent from single-gene associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. \n\nIn conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets often overlooked in single-gene strategies. By providing a novel framework that interprets genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER has significant implications for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genes function in coordination, often within specific contexts, necessitating an appreciation of their expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are central to disease development.\n\nTo address this need, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Its representation is grounded in gene modules, where genes with similar expression patterns across conditions are clustered together. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates drug mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes, even if they lack direct genetic associations. By incorporating co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic findings and reveals missed potential therapeutic targets often neglected by single-gene strategies. Through this innovative framework, PhenoPLIER enhances our ability to interpret genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, ultimately contributing significantly to unraveling disease etiology and elucidating drug mechanisms.",

Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Genes operate collectively in specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding this cooperation is crucial for unraveling how they influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have led to the discovery of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. We find that diseases are notably associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and their mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players without associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, through the integration of co-expressed gene groups, can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes typically function cooperatively in specific contexts, emphasizing the need for insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This comprehension is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in revealing individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms through genetic associations, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a substantial part in disease development and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, to address this gap. It maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on co-expression modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with module-expressed genes in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Additionally, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important yet genetically unassociated players by identifying them within trait-associated modules. By contextualizing genetic associations through co-expression groups, PhenoPLIER enhances single-gene strategies and offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic data via gene module analysis.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes often function collaboratively in specific contexts, emphasizing the need for insights into expression regulation across different conditions for precise characterization of their influence on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest gene-gene interactions play a significant role in diseases' origins and progression.\n\nTo fill this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Its representation is based on gene modules showing similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types; PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players, not strongly genetically associated, were prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules offers a unique perspective in the study of complex traits and reveals potential targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. By combining gene expression patterns with genetic studies, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetics, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms through functional genomics.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Existing methods like transcriptome-wide association studies often focus on individual genes, yet contemporary models emphasize the significance of interlinked gene activities in disease etiology. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. \n\nAt its core, PhenoPLIER relies on the understanding that genes work collaboratively within specific contexts to perform their functions. To decipher how these concerted actions influence complex traits, it's crucial to comprehend expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing innovative therapies. \n\nPhenoPLIER represents gene interactions based on modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We find that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, making PhenoPLIER accurate at predicting known drug-disease associations and revealing their underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation highlights that essential players, which often lack individual genetic associations, can be prioritized through the group-level strategy employed by PhenoPLIER. \n\nIn conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable perspective for contextualizing genetic associations and identifying targets potentially overlooked in single-gene approaches. By integrating gene modules, PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic findings to advance our understanding of complex traits and accelerate drug discovery.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

PhenoPLIER is our solution: a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data using a shared latent representation for joint analysis. As genes function in coordination, deciphering their influence on complex traits necessitates understanding expression regulation across varying conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have exposed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models assert that genetic interactions play a vital part in disease emergence and progression. \n\nThe content of our approach centers around PhenoPLIER's representation based on modules formed by genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We observed significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, leading to accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. In a case study using CRISPR screens for lipid regulation analysis, we found that functionally important players, despite lacking single-gene associations, were prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. \n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and unveils potential targets missed by singular gene strategies. This innovative framework, provided by PhenoPLIER, enables the interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, significantly contributing to the fields of therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

              "text": " In the pursuit of understanding complex traits, unraveling gene interactions and their regulatory mechanisms across diverse contexts has emerged as a critical step in advancing therapeutic developments. This study addresses this gap by highlighting the significance of gene modules in disease etiology and drug mechanism elucidation. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene expressions in relevant cell types, and our PhenoPLIER approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while revealing their underlying mechanisms. We further validate this approach by analyzing lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen. Importantly, genes critical for function might not exhibit single-gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies targets potentially overlooked by singular approaches. In doing so, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetics through the lens of functional genomics and gene expression patterns, contributing to advancements in drug repurposing and clustering complex traits studies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "In the field of genetics, understanding the collaborative actions of genes in specific contexts is crucial for unraveling complex trait influences. Investigating gene expression regulation across various conditions offers insight essential for advancing therapeutic developments. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Through our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, we accurately predict known drug-disease relationships and elucidate their mechanisms of action. As evidence, our CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed functional players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By contextualizing genetic associations using co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework not only interprets genetic associations but also facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of gene interactions and their implications for the development of novel therapeutics.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

To elucidate how these gene interactions contribute to complex traits, it is essential to grasp the regulatory mechanisms governing expression patterns across various conditions. This knowledge has been demonstrated as crucial for devising novel therapeutic interventions. Our study's results indicate a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We have developed an accurate method for predicting existing drug-disease connections, while also inferring the underlying mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observed that functionally critical genes, despite lacking direct genetic associations, are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by our PhenoPLIER approach. In summary, by employing co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potentially overlooked targets using single-gene strategies.

We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen on lipid regulation further highlights the significance of functionally important genes, often overlooked by single-gene strategies due to their absence in association studies.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

It exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen applied to lipid regulation further validated the approach: genes with substantial functional importance were not directly associated but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that considering groups of co-expressed genes enhances genetic association interpretation and reveals targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

To comprehend the influence of these gene interactions on complex traits, it is crucial to understand how expression regulation varies across diverse conditions. Studies have demonstrated that such insights are pivotal in advancing novel therapeutics. Our findings reveal that diseases significantly correlate with modules consisting of genes expressed predominantly in relevant cell types. Our method proves accurate in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Through the application of CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally essential players typically lack genetic association but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, through its incorporation of co-expressed genes, contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.

Understanding gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for unraveling these intricate relationships and developing effective therapies. Our research addresses this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that highlights the significance of diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating their mechanisms, PhenoPLIER demonstrates its effectiveness. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we found that crucial functional players without direct genetic associations were prioritized through PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion, by aggregating co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This method offers a transformative framework for interpreting complex genetic associations through the lens of gene module analysis.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": " In investigating the intricate relationship between genes and complex traits, it is crucial to understand their expression regulation across various conditions for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in identifying individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an essential part in disease onset and progression. We address this by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data within a shared latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules across similar conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with relevant cell type-specific gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while deciphering drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that crucial yet unassociated functional players are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-related gene modules. Through this approach, we fill the gap in elucidating gene interactions and their impact on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and informing therapeutic target selection for drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to comprehend expression regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding holds significance for therapy development. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided the discovery of individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions. We note that diseases significantly associate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach excels at predicting established drug-disease links and uncovering mechanisms of action. Moreover, we analyzed lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen and found that functionally critical genes, which typically lack associations, are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.",

Traditional approaches focus on individual genes identified through transcriptome-wide association studies, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in diseases. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared representation based on genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We demonstrate that this approach links diseases to gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and uncovers drug mechanisms. Additionally, through the analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screen, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes lacking direct associations but situated within trait-associated modules.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This insight is crucial in developing novel therapies, as demonstrated by previous research. Transcriptome-wide association studies have facilitated the discovery of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models highlight the significant impact of gene-gene interactions on disease etiology. To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers mechanisms of action. In a case study using CRISPR to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally critical genes without direct associations were prioritized by our method within trait-associated modules. Through this approach, PhenoPLIER offers novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Recent studies have highlighted the significance of genes working together in disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes' roles in diseases; however, modern traits models suggest gene interactions play a pivotal part in disease etiology. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach addressing this gap. It maps gene associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and gene expression patterns into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built around modules of genes exhibiting similar expressions across conditions. Our method demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and uncovers drugs' mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we found functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by our approach. This suggests the potential of PhenoPLIER in providing insights into understudied genes and guiding drug repurposing efforts.",

A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the quest to understand complex traits, genes' collaborative functioning within specific contexts emerges as crucial. Discovering how these concerted gene actions influence such traits necessitates unraveling expression regulation across distinct conditions. This knowledge is vital for advancing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, yet modern complex trait models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease development. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared expression pattern representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules containing genes with similar expressions across various conditions. Our results show significant connections between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing their mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen study on lipid regulation demonstrates that although functionally essential but non-associated genes are often overlooked, they can be prioritized within trait-linked modules by our approach. PhenoPLIER addresses a gap in understanding gene interactions and improves the prediction and interpretation of drug mechanisms for complex traits, thus advancing therapeutic strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paperâ€™s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meatâ€”your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
