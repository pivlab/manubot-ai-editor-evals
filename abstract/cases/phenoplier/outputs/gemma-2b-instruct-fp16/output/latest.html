**Projecting genetic associations through gene co-expression patterns identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**

This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel approach for mapping and analyzing genetic associations and drug repurposing targets. PhenoPLIER leverages the power of co-expression analysis to uncover disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. By integrating data on gene expression patterns, pharmacological perturbation, and disease etiology, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and facilitates the development of new therapeutic strategies.

The approach consists of three main steps: (1) constructing a co-expression network based on shared expression patterns across different conditions; (2) identifying modules of co-expressed genes that are significantly associated with disease; and (3) prioritizing these modules to prioritize candidate therapeutic targets.

Using this approach, we identified disease-associated gene modules in various cell types and predicted drug-disease pairs with high accuracy. Furthermore, we prioritized genes involved in lipid regulation based on a CRISPR screen, revealing that functionally important players were often missed by single-gene approaches.

Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for understanding genetic associations and identifying disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets. This approach provides a valuable framework for personalized medicine and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases.

We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by applying it to a dataset of lipid-related genes and phenotypes. We find that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. This approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of disease mechanisms.

**PhenoPLIER: A computational approach to uncover disease etiology and drug repurposing through gene co-expression analysis**

**Abstract**

Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have focused on gene co-expression analysis to uncover disease-relevant mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to co-expression analysis have limitations in capturing the spatial and temporal context of gene regulation. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach utilizes modules of co-expressed genes to capture the spatial and temporal relationships between genes. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates drug repurposing mechanisms. We further leverage a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, highlighting genes that are functionally important but lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by contextualizing them within the landscape of co-expressed genes.

**PhenoPLIER: A Novel Framework for Interpreting Genetic Associations through Gene Module Contextualization**

PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that integrates gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging the modular nature of gene expression, PhenoPLIER captures the intricate interplay between genes that contribute to complex traits. This approach facilitates a deeper mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Our approach is particularly valuable for studying diseases that involve multiple genetic variants or phenotypic traits. Traditional approaches that focus on single genes may overlook the importance of gene interactions and contextual effects. PhenoPLIER overcomes these limitations by grouping genes with similar expression patterns, enabling the identification of co-regulated modules associated with specific diseases.

We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for therapeutic interventions. By integrating information from multiple data sources, our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug repurposing opportunities.

Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to validate the functional importance of specific genes within PhenoPLIER-identified modules. Our results highlight the importance of gene co-regulation in disease pathogenesis, which was not previously appreciated by traditional approaches.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering novel disease mechanisms. Its ability to contextualize gene expression patterns and integrate data from multiple sources makes it an invaluable resource for advancing our understanding of complex diseases.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.</td>

**PhenoPLIER: A computational framework for understanding genetic associations through gene co-expression patterns**

PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. By leveraging the co-expression of genes across different conditions, PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of disease-relevant mechanisms.

Our approach involves the construction of gene modules based on genes with similar expression patterns, enabling the discovery of disease-associated gene modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER by predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating the mechanisms of action of drug candidates.

Furthermore, we leverage a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players are often missed by single-gene approaches but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a valuable framework for understanding genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by traditional methods.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations by leveraging the co-expression of genes to reveal complex disease mechanisms. It offers a novel perspective on disease etiology and drug repurposing by integrating data from multiple levels of biological organization.

**Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Module Analysis Reveals Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**

This study employs a comprehensive approach to investigate the genetic associations between gene expression patterns and disease etiology. We leverage gene co-expression and clustering algorithms to identify co-regulated gene modules associated with specific disease subtypes. Through functional validation and drug repurposing analysis, we establish the predictive power of our approach in identifying known drug-disease pairs and elucidating disease mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that gene modules enriched in lipid metabolism are prioritized in disease etiology, highlighting the importance of lipid regulation in disease progression. By integrating gene co-expression with functional genomics, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

**Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**

This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for integrating gene expression and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules, highlighting disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets. By clustering complex traits based on gene expression patterns, we identify genes that are critical for disease pathogenesis. Functional validation using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation demonstrates the importance of these genes in disease etiology. Our approach provides a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology, predicting drug-disease relationships, and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

**Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**

This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for integrating gene expression and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules, highlighting disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets. By clustering complex traits based on gene expression patterns, we identify genes that are critical for disease pathogenesis. Functional validation using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation demonstrates the importance of these genes in disease etiology. Our approach provides a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology, predicting drug-disease relationships, and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

**Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns Uncovers Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**

This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified representation for comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules based on shared expression patterns across relevant cell types, revealing the role of specific gene groups in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By leveraging a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering functionally important genes that are missed by traditional approaches. Our findings provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, revealing the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies novel drug targets by prioritizing modules of genes associated with specific diseases. This approach provides novel insights into disease mechanisms and opens avenues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions to identify disease-relevant gene modules. We demonstrate the efficacy of PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen and finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. This approach provides new insights into disease mechanisms and opens avenues for drug discovery and personalized medicine.

**Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**

This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for integrating and analyzing transcriptome-wide association data, drug perturbation, and phenotypic information to identify disease mechanisms and predict drug repurposing targets. PhenoPLIER leverages the power of modular analysis to group genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, uncovering disease-associated gene modules that are enriched in specific cell types. By integrating this information with drug perturbation data, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action. Additionally, we leverage a CRISPR screen to validate the functional importance of specific genes within these modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing opportunities.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation captures the expression patterns of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, enabling the identification of disease-relevant molecular mechanisms. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for a subset of diseases by prioritizing genes in trait-associated modules.

**Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**

This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression data, drug-disease relationships, and pharmacological perturbation information into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages the modular nature of gene expression patterns to identify disease-associated gene modules, highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug response. By integrating functional genomics and drug repurposing data, PhenoPLIER provides mechanistic insights into complex traits and facilitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for lipid-related diseases, demonstrating its potential to advance our understanding of disease etiology and accelerate the development of personalized therapies.

**Context:** Advances in gene expression analysis have revealed the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing models of complex trait architecture predict that these interactions are essential for disease initiation and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules and reveals that lipid regulation plays a significant role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, with functionally important players being prioritized in trait-associated modules.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that these modules can be prioritized by drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. By focusing on gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for understanding the etiology and drug mechanisms of complex diseases.
