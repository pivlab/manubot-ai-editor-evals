          **Projecting genetic associations through gene co-expression patterns
          identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel approach for mapping and
          analyzing genetic associations and drug repurposing targets.
          PhenoPLIER leverages the power of co-expression analysis to uncover
          disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. By
          integrating data on gene expression patterns, pharmacological
          perturbation, and disease etiology, PhenoPLIER provides a
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and facilitates the
          development of new therapeutic strategies.


          The approach consists of three main steps: (1) constructing a
          co-expression network based on shared expression patterns across
          different conditions; (2) identifying modules of co-expressed genes
          that are significantly associated with disease; and (3) prioritizing
          these modules to prioritize candidate therapeutic targets.


          Using this approach, we identified disease-associated gene modules in
          various cell types and predicted drug-disease pairs with high
          accuracy. Furthermore, we prioritized genes involved in lipid
          regulation based on a CRISPR screen, revealing that functionally
          important players were often missed by single-gene approaches.


          Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for
          understanding genetic associations and identifying disease mechanisms
          and drug repurposing targets. This approach provides a valuable
          framework for personalized medicine and the development of novel
          therapeutic strategies for complex diseases.

          PhenoPLIER is an integrative approach that combines gene co-expression
          analysis and pharmacological perturbation data to reveal disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. This method maps gene-trait associations
          and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation for a
          joint analysis. PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules
          by clustering genes with similar expression patterns across different
          conditions. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and identifies novel drug-disease relationships.
          Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          find that functionally important players are missed by single-gene
          strategies but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and has
          significant implications for understanding disease etiology and
          developing new therapies.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          **Projecting genetic associations through shared gene expression
          patterns identifies disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates multi-omic data to identify genetic associations and drug
          repurposing opportunities. PhenoPLIER leverages the co-expression of
          genes across different conditions to uncover disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. By clustering genes with similar expression patterns,
          PhenoPLIER identifies novel targets that are missed by traditional
          single-gene approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of PhenoPLIER in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating disease
          mechanisms. Furthermore, we leverage a CRISPR screen to validate the
          functional importance of specific genes within the PhenoPLIER modules.
          Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of genetic
          associations and facilitates the identification of potential
          therapeutic targets for complex diseases.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER
          identifies disease-associated gene modules by clustering genes with
          similar expression patterns across different conditions. We
          demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid regulation
          using a CRISPR screen and finding that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling the
          identification of potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          **Context**


          This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          approach allows researchers to identify disease-relevant gene modules
          by integrating information from multiple data types.


          **Content**


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that can
          identify disease-relevant gene modules by integrating information from
          multiple data types. PhenoPLIER uses a latent representation to
          capture the co-expression patterns of genes across different
          conditions. This approach allows researchers to identify gene modules
          that are involved in the same disease pathways, even if they are not
          directly associated with each other.


          **Conclusion**


          By integrating information from multiple data types, PhenoPLIER can
          identify disease-relevant gene modules and provide insights into the
          molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits. This approach has the
          potential to revolutionize the field of genetic research by enabling
          researchers to identify new drug targets and develop more effective
          therapies.

          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach allows
          researchers to identify co-expressed genes and prioritize them based
          on their functional and phenotypic roles. PhenoPLIER can be used to
          uncover novel drug-disease relationships and to identify potential
          targets for therapeutic intervention. We demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER by applying it to a dataset of lipid-related genes and
          phenotypes. We find that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. This approach
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of disease
          mechanisms.

          **Projecting genetic associations through co-expression patterns
          reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER reveals that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. By
          incorporating co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          **PhenoPLIER: A computational approach to uncover disease etiology and
          drug repurposing through gene co-expression analysis**


          **Abstract**


          Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits is critical
          for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have
          focused on gene co-expression analysis to uncover disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to co-expression analysis
          have limitations in capturing the spatial and temporal context of gene
          regulation. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          approach utilizes modules of co-expressed genes to capture the spatial
          and temporal relationships between genes. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates drug repurposing mechanisms. We further leverage a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, highlighting genes that are
          functionally important but lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations by contextualizing them within the
          landscape of co-expressed genes.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions.


          **Content:** PhenoPLIER uses a novel approach to analyze genetic
          associations by grouping co-expressed genes into modules. This
          approach allows researchers to identify disease-associated gene
          modules and understand how these modules interact with each other to
          influence complex traits. PhenoPLIER was able to accurately predict
          known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and it
          identified potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach
          allows researchers to identify disease-associated gene modules and
          understand how these modules interact with each other to influence

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene co-expression patterns
          reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER reveals
          the mechanistic role of gene co-expression in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. By grouping genes with similar expression patterns
          across different conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated
          gene modules that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches.
          Our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development. We
          further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering novel
          therapeutic targets by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen. Our results provide a novel perspective on understanding
          genetic associations and provide insights into disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates
          gene expression patterns with drug-disease associations to provide a
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


          **Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a novel representation based on
          co-expression modules to analyze genetic associations and drug-disease
          relationships. We observe that diseases are associated with gene
          modules enriched in specific cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the underlying
          mechanisms. Furthermore, we leverage a CRISPR screen to identify genes
          that are crucial but missed by traditional single-gene analysis,
          highlighting the importance of considering co-expression patterns in
          disease research.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a novel perspective on
          interpreting genetic associations by leveraging the power of
          co-expression analysis. This approach can uncover hidden
          relationships, improve the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, and
          facilitate a deeper understanding of disease etiology and progression.

          **PhenoPLIER: A Novel Framework for Interpreting Genetic Associations
          through Gene Module Contextualization**


          PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that integrates
          gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging the
          modular nature of gene expression, PhenoPLIER captures the intricate
          interplay between genes that contribute to complex traits. This
          approach facilitates a deeper mechanistic understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.


          Our approach is particularly valuable for studying diseases that
          involve multiple genetic variants or phenotypic traits. Traditional
          approaches that focus on single genes may overlook the importance of
          gene interactions and contextual effects. PhenoPLIER overcomes these
          limitations by grouping genes with similar expression patterns,
          enabling the identification of co-regulated modules associated with
          specific diseases.


          We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for therapeutic
          interventions. By integrating information from multiple data sources,
          our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and drug repurposing opportunities.


          Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to validate the functional
          importance of specific genes within PhenoPLIER-identified modules. Our
          results highlight the importance of gene co-regulation in disease
          pathogenesis, which was not previously appreciated by traditional
          approaches.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting genetic
          associations and uncovering novel disease mechanisms. Its ability to
          contextualize gene expression patterns and integrate data from
          multiple sources makes it an invaluable resource for advancing our
          understanding of complex diseases.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates and analyzes
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation. By identifying co-expressed gene
          modules, PhenoPLIER facilitates a deeper understanding of complex
          traits by uncovering the interplay between genes and their roles in
          disease. This method successfully complements existing approaches by
          identifying novel drug-disease pairs and elucidating the molecular
          mechanisms underlying disease progression. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations by leveraging the
          power of gene modules to contextualize and prioritize disease-relevant
          genes.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene co-expression patterns
          reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps co-expression
          patterns across multiple conditions to a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. By identifying gene modules with consistent
          expression patterns, PhenoPLIER facilitates the discovery of
          disease-relevant mechanisms. We demonstrate its efficacy in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidating the mechanisms of action for
          a lipid disorder using a CRISPR screen. PhenoPLIER's ability to
          contextualize genetic associations highlights the importance of
          considering co-expression patterns in understanding disease etiology.
          This approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates
          multi-omic data into a unified representation of gene-trait
          associations and drug effects. It reveals disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms by identifying co-expressed gene modules across different
          cell types.


          **Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a modular approach to analyze gene
          expression patterns and drug perturbation data. It reveals that
          diseases are associated with gene modules enriched in cell types
          relevant to the disease. By integrating this information, PhenoPLIER
          identifies drug-disease pairs and elucidates drug mechanisms of
          action.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations by contextualizing them through gene modules. It
          offers a deeper understanding of disease etiology and facilitates the
          identification of novel therapeutic targets.

          **Projecting genetic associations through co-expression patterns
          identifies disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene expression
          data from genetic studies, functional genomics, and drug repurposing
          to generate a unified representation of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our approach leverages the co-expression of genes to
          capture the intricate interactions between different genetic and
          environmental factors that contribute to disease onset and
          progression.


          We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying
          disease etiology. By analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
          we identify functionally important genes that are missed by
          traditional single-gene approaches but are highly enriched in
          trait-associated modules.


          Our approach provides a novel perspective on understanding genetic
          associations by highlighting the importance of co-expression patterns
          in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER offers a powerful
          tool for researchers and clinicians to identify novel therapeutic
          targets and develop more effective interventions for complex diseases.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to
          generate a unified representation of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.


          **Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes to
          capture the shared expression patterns across different conditions.
          This approach facilitates the discovery of novel drug-disease pairs
          and elucidates disease mechanisms by identifying genes that are
          crucial for specific traits. By integrating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of genetic
          associations and offers novel insights into disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling the
          identification of novel therapeutic targets and providing a deeper
          mechanistic understanding of complex traits.

          **PhenoPLIER: A computational framework for understanding genetic
          associations through gene co-expression patterns**


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. By
          leveraging the co-expression of genes across different conditions,
          PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of disease-relevant
          mechanisms.


          Our approach involves the construction of gene modules based on genes
          with similar expression patterns, enabling the discovery of
          disease-associated gene modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER by predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating the
          mechanisms of action of drug candidates.


          Furthermore, we leverage a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          and find that functionally important players are often missed by
          single-gene approaches but are prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a valuable framework for
          understanding genetic associations and uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that may be missed by traditional methods.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting genetic
          associations by leveraging the co-expression of genes to reveal
          complex disease mechanisms. It offers a novel perspective on disease
          etiology and drug repurposing by integrating data from multiple levels
          of biological organization.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified representation for a joint analysis. This approach provides
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms by identifying
          co-expressed gene modules that are enriched in disease-relevant cell
          types.


          **Content:** We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that utilizes
          gene co-expression and drug-disease relationship data to uncover
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER represents genes with
          similar expression patterns across different conditions into a common
          latent representation. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies
          novel targets. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and find that functionally important players are missed by
          single-gene strategies but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
          trait-associated modules.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations by contextualizing disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms through the lens of gene modules. This approach allows
          researchers to identify novel targets and develop more effective
          therapies by integrating multi-omic data into a unified representation
          of disease processes.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene co-expression patterns
          illuminates disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          This study investigates the complex interplay between genes and their
          expression patterns to elucidate the etiology of diseases and identify
          potential therapeutic targets. We leverage gene co-expression analysis
          to identify co-regulated gene modules that are associated with disease
          risk and drug response. Our approach successfully predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and provides novel insights into the molecular
          mechanisms underlying disease progression. By integrating gene
          co-expression data with phenotypic information, PhenoPLIER reveals
          contextually relevant genetic associations that are missed by
          traditional single-gene analysis. This framework provides a powerful
          tool for dissecting complex traits and identifying novel therapeutic
          opportunities.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          **Context:** This study investigates the role of gene co-expression in
          understanding the etiology and drug mechanisms of complex traits.


          **Content:** We developed a novel approach to identify
          disease-associated gene modules by leveraging the co-expression
          network of relevant cell types. Our method successfully predicted
          known drug-disease pairs and inferred drug mechanisms of action. We
          further used a CRISPR screen to identify lipid regulators that are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results
          provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by
          considering the context of gene expression.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          identify potential therapeutic targets missed by traditional
          single-gene approaches. This study highlights the importance of
          considering gene co-expression patterns in understanding disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          a single paragraph:


          Genes are intricately regulated to perform their functions in specific
          contexts. We developed a method to identify disease-associated gene
          modules by integrating co-expression analysis and drug-disease
          association. Our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease
          pairs and revealed novel mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, identifying genes that are
          essential for specific traits but are not associated with individual
          genes. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations by considering the context of co-expression and
          prioritizing genes that are enriched in disease-associated modules.

          **Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns
          Identifies Disease Etiologies and Drug Mechanisms**


          Our study reveals that diseases are associated with gene modules that
          are highly expressed in specific cell types. We leverage a clustering
          approach known as PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation and identify
          functionally important genes that are missed by traditional
          single-gene methods. By integrating co-expression data with
          drug-disease associations, we infer drug-disease relationships and
          mechanisms of action. Our approach successfully predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and identifies novel therapeutic targets. Moreover,
          we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for
          understanding genetic associations by contextualizing them within the
          framework of gene modules.

          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          **Context:** This study investigates how gene expression patterns
          contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms by identifying
          co-expressed genes associated with specific diseases.


          **Content:** We develop a novel approach that utilizes co-expression
          analysis and machine learning to identify disease-associated gene
          modules and predict drug-disease relationships. Our approach
          successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals novel
          therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, a clustering
          algorithm for co-expression analysis, can contextualize genetic
          associations and identify missed targets by single-gene strategies.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for
          interpreting genetic associations by leveraging the power of
          co-expression analysis and machine learning. This approach offers new
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for
          the development of more effective therapies.

          **Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Module Analysis Reveals
          Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**


          This study employs a comprehensive approach to investigate the genetic
          associations between gene expression patterns and disease etiology. We
          leverage gene co-expression and clustering algorithms to identify
          co-regulated gene modules associated with specific disease subtypes.
          Through functional validation and drug repurposing analysis, we
          establish the predictive power of our approach in identifying known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidating disease mechanisms. Our analysis
          reveals that gene modules enriched in lipid metabolism are prioritized
          in disease etiology, highlighting the importance of lipid regulation
          in disease progression. By integrating gene co-expression with
          functional genomics, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic
          targets that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

          **Context:** This study aims to elucidate the role of gene
          co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms using a novel
          clustering approach called PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER integrates groups of
          co-expressed genes to reveal context-dependent genetic associations
          and prioritize drug-disease targets.


          **Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a CRISPR screen to identify
          lipid-related genes associated with disease. By integrating these
          genes into a co-expression network, they identify functionally
          important players that are missed by traditional single-gene analysis.
          These findings provide novel insights into disease etiology and
          suggest novel therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations by considering co-expression patterns. This
          approach enables the identification of context-dependent targets and
          facilitates the development of more accurate and comprehensive disease
          diagnosis and treatment strategies.

          Our study reveals the importance of considering gene co-expression
          patterns in understanding complex traits. We develop a novel approach,

          provides a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations by
          considering the context of gene expression, enabling the

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns: a
          novel framework for disease etiology and drug repurposing**


          This study explores the intricate interplay between gene expression
          and disease etiology by leveraging the power of co-expression
          analysis. We demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with
          gene modules enriched in specific cell types, providing valuable
          insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
          Our approach, based on PhenoPLIER, a novel clustering algorithm,
          accurately identifies known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the
          underlying mechanisms of action. Moreover, we leverage a CRISPR screen
          to uncover lipid-related genes that are functionally important but not
          significant individually but are highly enriched in trait-associated
          modules. By integrating co-expression analysis with functional
          genomics, we reveal a comprehensive understanding of genetic
          associations and identify novel therapeutic opportunities that
          single-gene strategies may miss. This framework offers a powerful tool
          for dissecting complex diseases and developing innovative therapeutic
          strategies.

          **Context:** Advances in gene expression analysis have revolutionized
          our understanding of complex traits, revealing the critical role of
          gene modules in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
          directly identifying these modules and understanding their roles is
          challenging due to the complexity of biological systems.


          **Content:** This study presents a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that
          utilizes gene co-expression analysis to identify disease-associated
          gene modules and predict drug-disease relationships. PhenoPLIER
          integrates data from a CRISPR screen targeting lipid metabolism,
          allowing us to prioritize genes that are involved in disease while
          being missed by traditional single-gene approaches. By clustering
          genes based on their co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER reveals novel
          disease-associated molecular networks, providing mechanistic insights
          into disease etiology and paving the way for novel therapeutic
          strategies.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER unveils a comprehensive understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms by contextualizing genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules. This innovative
          approach enhances our ability to identify potential therapeutic
          targets and provides a valuable tool for advancing our understanding
          of complex diseases.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract with a clear sentence structure and
          fits in a single paragraph:


          Genes operate in concert to regulate complex traits, but the exact
          mechanisms are still not fully understood. This study aimed to fill
          this gap by identifying gene modules that are associated with diseases
          and to develop a novel method to predict drug-disease pairs and
          mechanisms of action. Our results suggest that PhenoPLIER, a novel
          approach that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets
          missed by traditional single-gene approaches. This method provides a
          valuable framework for understanding the complex interplay of genes
          and diseases.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns: a
          novel framework for disease etiology and drug repurposing**


          This study investigates the role of gene expression patterns in
          disease etiology and drug repurposing. We leverage the co-expression
          of genes in relevant cell types to identify disease-associated gene
          modules and uncover the underlying mechanisms of action. By
          integrating groups of co-expressed genes into a clustering algorithm,
          PhenoPLIER reveals novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our
          approach successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
          insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology. We
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting
          genetic associations and uncovering hidden relationships that are
          missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

          **Context:** This study aims to uncover the genetic drivers of complex
          traits by leveraging the power of co-expression analysis. It seeks to
          identify disease-associated gene modules and elucidate the molecular
          mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug repurposing.


          **Content:** We develop a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, to analyze gene
          expression patterns and discover disease-associated gene modules.
          PhenoPLIER utilizes a clustering approach that considers both the
          spatial and temporal relationships between genes. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals novel
          drug-disease relationships by prioritizing genes associated with
          specific trait clusters. We further explore lipid regulation by
          performing a CRISPR screen and find that functionally important genes
          are often missed by traditional single-gene approaches. By integrating
          co-expression analysis with functional genomics, PhenoPLIER provides a
          comprehensive framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          Genes operate in intricate concert to regulate gene expression across
          diverse contexts. We present a novel approach that comprehensively
          characterizes the genetic landscape of disease-associated cell types.
          By integrating a CRISPR screen with machine learning, we identify
          lipid regulators that are enriched in disease-associated modules.
          PhenoPLIER provides a robust framework for interpreting genetic
          associations by revealing previously overlooked patterns and
          prioritizing potential targets missed by traditional single-gene
          approaches. This approach significantly improves our understanding of
          disease mechanisms and opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for
          integrating gene expression and pharmacological perturbation data into
          a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER reveals significant
          associations between diseases and specific gene modules, highlighting
          disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets. By clustering complex
          traits based on gene expression patterns, we identify genes that are
          critical for disease pathogenesis. Functional validation using a
          CRISPR screen on lipid regulation demonstrates the importance of these
          genes in disease etiology. Our approach provides a powerful tool for
          understanding disease etiology, predicting drug-disease relationships,
          and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene expression
          data, drug-disease perturbation data, and clustering of complex traits
          to identify gene modules associated with disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. By mapping these modules to known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating their mechanisms of action, PhenoPLIER provides valuable

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions, revealing the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the
          mechanisms of action of novel therapeutic agents. Additionally, by
          analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identify genes
          that are essential but overlooked by traditional gene-trait
          association studies.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          **Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns
          Uncovers Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates transcriptome-wide association studies and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified representation for comprehensive
          analysis. PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules based
          on shared expression patterns across relevant cell types, revealing
          the role of specific gene groups in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. By leveraging a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering functionally
          important genes that are missed by traditional approaches. Our
          findings provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and pave the
          way for targeted therapeutic interventions.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER utilizes
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different
          conditions to identify disease-relevant gene modules. We demonstrate
          the efficacy of PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid regulation using a
          CRISPR screen and finding that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. This
          approach provides new insights into disease mechanisms and opens
          avenues for drug discovery and personalized medicine.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for
          integrating and analyzing transcriptome-wide association data, drug
          perturbation, and phenotypic information to identify disease
          mechanisms and predict drug repurposing targets. PhenoPLIER leverages
          the power of modular analysis to group genes with similar expression
          patterns across different conditions, uncovering disease-associated
          gene modules that are enriched in specific cell types. By integrating
          this information with drug perturbation data, PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we leverage a CRISPR screen to validate the
          functional importance of specific genes within these modules,
          providing insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing
          opportunities.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          **Context:** This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This approach enables the identification of disease-relevant
          gene modules and the prediction of drug-disease relationships and
          therapeutic targets.


          **Content:** PhenoPLIER employs a novel approach to integrate and
          analyze genetic and phenotypic data. It constructs a latent
          representation of gene expression patterns and drug perturbation
          effects, capturing shared patterns across different conditions. This
          representation facilitates the identification of disease-associated
          gene modules and the discovery of novel drug-disease relationships.


          **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for understanding
          the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By integrating multiple data
          sources, it enables a comprehensive analysis of disease etiology and
          opens new avenues for disease treatment and drug discovery.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene expression data, drug-disease relationships, and
          pharmacological perturbation information into a unified latent
          representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages the modular
          nature of gene expression patterns to identify disease-associated gene
          modules, highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology and drug response. By integrating functional genomics
          and drug repurposing data, PhenoPLIER provides mechanistic insights
          into complex traits and facilitates the discovery of novel therapeutic
          targets. Our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and elucidates the mechanisms of action for lipid-related diseases,
          demonstrating its potential to advance our understanding of disease
          etiology and accelerate the development of personalized therapies.

          Sure, here's the revised abstract:


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach reveals that
          diseases are associated with gene modules enriched in specific cell
          types, highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action of candidate drugs by
          prioritizing gene modules associated with disease traits. Finally, it
          identifies lipid regulators that are essential for disease but are
          neglected by traditional gene-expression-based approaches.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          identifies disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation captures
          the functional relationships between genes and disease outcomes.
          PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules and predicts
          drug-disease relationships, providing insights into disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms. By integrating multiple data sources, including
          transcriptome-wide association studies, functional genomics, and
          CRISPR screens, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of complex
          traits and facilitates the development of novel therapeutic
          strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach reveals that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and that these modules can be prioritized by
          drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. By focusing on
          gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for
          understanding the etiology and drug mechanisms of complex diseases.

              **Projecting genetic associations through gene co-expression
              patterns identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing
              targets**


              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel approach for mapping and
              analyzing genetic associations and drug repurposing targets.
              PhenoPLIER leverages the power of co-expression analysis to
              uncover disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic
              targets. By integrating data on gene expression patterns,
              pharmacological perturbation, and disease etiology, PhenoPLIER
              provides a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and
              facilitates the development of new therapeutic strategies.


              The approach consists of three main steps: (1) constructing a
              co-expression network based on shared expression patterns across
              different conditions; (2) identifying modules of co-expressed
              genes that are significantly associated with disease; and (3)
              prioritizing these modules to prioritize candidate therapeutic
              targets.


              Using this approach, we identified disease-associated gene modules
              in various cell types and predicted drug-disease pairs with high
              accuracy. Furthermore, we prioritized genes involved in lipid
              regulation based on a CRISPR screen, revealing that functionally
              important players were often missed by single-gene approaches.


              Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for
              understanding genetic associations and identifying disease
              mechanisms and drug repurposing targets. This approach provides a
              valuable framework for personalized medicine and the development
              of novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases.

              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression

              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              PhenoPLIER is an integrative approach that combines gene
              co-expression analysis and pharmacological perturbation data to
              reveal disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This method maps
              gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER identifies
              disease-associated gene modules by clustering genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate
              that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              identifies novel drug-disease relationships. Furthermore, we use a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that
              functionally important players are missed by single-gene
              strategies but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
              and has significant implications for understanding disease
              etiology and developing new therapies.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
              reveals disease-associated gene modules and provides insights into
              disease mechanisms. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR
              screen, we identified genes that lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              approach helps to contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              **Projecting genetic associations through shared gene expression
              patterns identifies disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates multi-omic data to identify genetic associations and
              drug repurposing opportunities. PhenoPLIER leverages the
              co-expression of genes across different conditions to uncover
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering genes with
              similar expression patterns, PhenoPLIER identifies novel targets
              that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches. We
              demonstrate the efficacy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating disease mechanisms.
              Furthermore, we leverage a CRISPR screen to validate the
              functional importance of specific genes within the PhenoPLIER
              modules. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of
              genetic associations and facilitates the identification of
              potential therapeutic targets for complex diseases.

              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              **Context**


              This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              This approach allows researchers to identify disease-relevant gene
              modules by integrating information from multiple data types.


              **Content**


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              can identify disease-relevant gene modules by integrating
              information from multiple data types. PhenoPLIER uses a latent
              representation to capture the co-expression patterns of genes
              across different conditions. This approach allows researchers to
              identify gene modules that are involved in the same disease
              pathways, even if they are not directly associated with each
              other.


              **Conclusion**


              By integrating information from multiple data types, PhenoPLIER
              can identify disease-relevant gene modules and provide insights
              into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits. This
              approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of genetic
              research by enabling researchers to identify new drug targets and
              develop more effective therapies.

              **Projecting genetic associations through co-expression patterns

              **PhenoPLIER: A computational approach to contextualizing genetic
              associations and prioritizing disease targets**


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              different conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of

              **PhenoPLIER: A computational approach to uncover disease etiology
              and drug repurposing through gene co-expression analysis**


              **Abstract**


              Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits is
              critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Recent
              studies have focused on gene co-expression analysis to uncover
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to
              co-expression analysis have limitations in capturing the spatial
              and temporal context of gene regulation. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach utilizes
              modules of co-expressed genes to capture the spatial and temporal
              relationships between genes. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidates drug repurposing mechanisms. We further
              leverage a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, highlighting
              genes that are functionally important but lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER provides a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by
              contextualizing them within the landscape of co-expressed genes.

              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions.


              **Content:** PhenoPLIER uses a novel approach to analyze genetic
              associations by grouping co-expressed genes into modules. This
              approach allows researchers to identify disease-associated gene
              modules and understand how these modules interact with each other
              to influence complex traits. PhenoPLIER was able to accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action,
              and it identified potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.


              **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. This approach allows researchers to identify
              disease-associated gene modules and understand how these modules
              interact with each other to influence complex traits.

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation

              PhenoPLIER can be used to identify potential targets for disease
              treatment by prioritizing genes that are enriched in
              trait-associated modules. This approach provides a novel framework

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER
              reveals the mechanistic role of gene co-expression in disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. By grouping genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER
              identifies disease-associated gene modules that are missed by
              traditional single-gene approaches. Our approach successfully
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the molecular
              mechanisms underlying disease development. We further demonstrate
              the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering novel therapeutic targets
              by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. Our results
              provide a novel perspective on understanding genetic associations

              to provide a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms.

              co-expression modules to analyze genetic associations and
              drug-disease relationships. We observe that diseases are
              associated with gene modules enriched in specific cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and

              interpreting genetic associations by leveraging the power of
              co-expression analysis. This approach can uncover hidden
              relationships, improve the discovery of novel therapeutic targets,

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This approach reveals
              the importance of gene modules in disease etiology and
              progression. PhenoPLIER identifies drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates the mechanisms of action by prioritizing genes in
              specific gene modules. By integrating co-expression information,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for understanding genetic
              associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              **PhenoPLIER: A Novel Framework for Interpreting Genetic
              Associations through Gene Module Contextualization**


              PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that integrates
              gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. By
              leveraging the modular nature of gene expression, PhenoPLIER
              captures the intricate interplay between genes that contribute to
              complex traits. This approach facilitates a deeper mechanistic
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


              Our approach is particularly valuable for studying diseases that
              involve multiple genetic variants or phenotypic traits.
              Traditional approaches that focus on single genes may overlook the
              importance of gene interactions and contextual effects. PhenoPLIER
              overcomes these limitations by grouping genes with similar
              expression patterns, enabling the identification of co-regulated
              modules associated with specific diseases.


              We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for
              therapeutic interventions. By integrating information from
              multiple data sources, our approach provides a comprehensive
              understanding of disease etiology and drug repurposing
              opportunities.


              Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to validate the functional
              importance of specific genes within PhenoPLIER-identified modules.
              Our results highlight the importance of gene co-regulation in
              disease pathogenesis, which was not previously appreciated by
              traditional approaches.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting
              genetic associations and uncovering novel disease mechanisms. Its
              ability to contextualize gene expression patterns and integrate
              data from multiple sources makes it an invaluable resource for
              advancing our understanding of complex diseases.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              **Projecting genetic associations through gene co-expression
              patterns reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps co-expression
              patterns across multiple conditions to a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. By identifying gene modules
              with consistent expression patterns, PhenoPLIER facilitates the
              discovery of disease-relevant mechanisms. We demonstrate its
              efficacy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              the mechanisms of action for a lipid disorder using a CRISPR
              screen. PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations
              highlights the importance of considering co-expression patterns in
              understanding disease etiology. This approach provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying
              potential therapeutic targets.

              **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that
              integrates multi-omic data into a unified representation of
              gene-trait associations and drug effects. It reveals disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms by identifying co-expressed gene
              modules across different cell types.


              **Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a modular approach to analyze
              gene expression patterns and drug perturbation data. It reveals
              that diseases are associated with gene modules enriched in cell
              types relevant to the disease. By integrating this information,
              PhenoPLIER identifies drug-disease pairs and elucidates drug
              mechanisms of action.


              **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations by contextualizing them through
              gene modules. It offers a deeper understanding of disease etiology
              and facilitates the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              and drug-disease data into a common latent representation for a
              joint analysis. This approach facilitates the identification of
              disease-associated gene modules by leveraging the modular nature
              of gene expression patterns. PhenoPLIER successfully predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and illuminates the mechanisms of action
              by prioritizing genes associated with specific disease-associated
              gene modules. By integrating co-expression information, PhenoPLIER

              **Projecting genetic associations through co-expression patterns
              identifies disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene
              expression data from genetic studies, functional genomics, and
              drug repurposing to generate a unified representation of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach leverages the
              co-expression of genes to capture the intricate interactions
              between different genetic and environmental factors that
              contribute to disease onset and progression.


              We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates the molecular mechanisms
              underlying disease etiology. By analyzing a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation, we identify functionally important genes that
              are missed by traditional single-gene approaches but are highly
              enriched in trait-associated modules.


              Our approach provides a novel perspective on understanding genetic
              associations by highlighting the importance of co-expression
              patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER
              offers a powerful tool for researchers and clinicians to identify
              novel therapeutic targets and develop more effective interventions
              for complex diseases.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to generate a unified representation of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.


              **Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes to
              capture the shared expression patterns across different
              conditions. This approach facilitates the discovery of novel
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates disease mechanisms by
              identifying genes that are crucial for specific traits. By
              integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and offers
              novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


              **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling
              the identification of novel therapeutic targets and providing a
              deeper mechanistic understanding of complex traits.

              **PhenoPLIER: A computational framework for understanding genetic
              associations through gene co-expression patterns**


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. By
              leveraging the co-expression of genes across different conditions,
              PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of disease-relevant
              mechanisms.


              Our approach involves the construction of gene modules based on
              genes with similar expression patterns, enabling the discovery of
              disease-associated gene modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of
              PhenoPLIER by predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              the mechanisms of action of drug candidates.


              Furthermore, we leverage a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and find that functionally important players are often
              missed by single-gene approaches but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a
              valuable framework for understanding genetic associations and
              uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
              traditional methods.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting
              genetic associations by leveraging the co-expression of genes to
              reveal complex disease mechanisms. It offers a novel perspective

              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              **Context:** PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified representation for a joint
              analysis. This approach provides insights into disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms by identifying co-expressed gene modules that
              are enriched in disease-relevant cell types.


              **Content:** We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that utilizes
              gene co-expression and drug-disease relationship data to uncover
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER represents genes
              with similar expression patterns across different conditions into
              a common latent representation. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and identifies novel targets. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
              important players are missed by single-gene strategies but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.


              **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations by contextualizing disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms through the lens of gene modules.
              This approach allows researchers to identify novel targets and
              develop more effective therapies by integrating multi-omic data
              into a unified representation of disease processes.

              Genes are intricately regulated to perform their functions in
              specific contexts. We developed a method to identify
              disease-associated gene modules by integrating co-expression
              analysis and drug-disease association. Our approach accurately
              predicted known drug-disease pairs and revealed novel mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, identifying genes that are essential for specific
              traits but are not associated with individual genes. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              by considering the context of co-expression and prioritizing genes
              that are enriched in disease-associated modules.

              **Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns
              Identifies Disease Etiologies and Drug Mechanisms**


              Our study reveals that diseases are associated with gene modules
              that are highly expressed in specific cell types. We leverage a
              clustering approach known as PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid
              regulation and identify functionally important genes that are
              missed by traditional single-gene methods. By integrating
              co-expression data with drug-disease associations, we infer
              drug-disease relationships and mechanisms of action. Our approach
              successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies
              novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, we demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for understanding genetic
              associations by contextualizing them within the framework of gene
              modules.

              **Context:** This study investigates how gene expression patterns
              contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms by identifying
              co-expressed genes associated with specific diseases.


              **Content:** We develop a novel approach that utilizes
              co-expression analysis and machine learning to identify
              disease-associated gene modules and predict drug-disease
              relationships. Our approach successfully predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and reveals novel therapeutic targets. We
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER, a clustering algorithm for
              co-expression analysis, can contextualize genetic associations and
              identify missed targets by single-gene strategies.

              interpreting genetic associations by leveraging the power of
              co-expression analysis and machine learning. This approach offers
              new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the

              **Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Module Analysis
              Reveals Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**


              This study employs a comprehensive approach to investigate the
              genetic associations between gene expression patterns and disease
              etiology. We leverage gene co-expression and clustering algorithms
              to identify co-regulated gene modules associated with specific
              disease subtypes. Through functional validation and drug
              repurposing analysis, we establish the predictive power of our
              approach in identifying known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              disease mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that gene modules
              enriched in lipid metabolism are prioritized in disease etiology,
              highlighting the importance of lipid regulation in disease
              progression. By integrating gene co-expression with functional
              genomics, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets
              that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

              **Context:** This study aims to elucidate the role of gene
              co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms using a
              novel clustering approach called PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER integrates
              groups of co-expressed genes to reveal context-dependent genetic
              associations and prioritize drug-disease targets.


              **Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a CRISPR screen to identify
              lipid-related genes associated with disease. By integrating these
              genes into a co-expression network, they identify functionally
              important players that are missed by traditional single-gene
              analysis. These findings provide novel insights into disease
              etiology and suggest novel therapeutic targets for drug
              repurposing.


              **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations by considering co-expression
              patterns. This approach enables the identification of
              context-dependent targets and facilitates the development of more
              accurate and comprehensive disease diagnosis and treatment
              strategies.

              Our study reveals the importance of considering gene co-expression
              patterns in understanding complex traits. We develop a novel
              approach, PhenoPLIER, that utilizes CRISPR screening and pathway
              analysis to identify lipid-related genes associated with disease
              risk. By integrating co-expression data into PhenoPLIER, we
              uncover novel drug-disease pairs and reveal mechanisms of action.
              Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of genetic
              associations by considering the context of gene expression,
              enabling the identification of potential targets missed by
              traditional single-gene approaches.

              patterns: a novel framework for disease etiology and drug
              repurposing**


              This study explores the intricate interplay between gene
              expression and disease etiology by leveraging the power of
              co-expression analysis. We demonstrate that diseases are strongly
              associated with gene modules enriched in specific cell types,
              providing valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential
              therapeutic targets. Our approach, based on PhenoPLIER, a novel
              clustering algorithm, accurately identifies known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidates the underlying mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, we leverage a CRISPR screen to uncover lipid-related
              genes that are functionally important but not significant
              individually but are highly enriched in trait-associated modules.
              By integrating co-expression analysis with functional genomics, we
              reveal a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and
              identify novel therapeutic opportunities that single-gene
              strategies may miss. This framework offers a powerful tool for
              dissecting complex diseases and developing innovative therapeutic
              strategies.

              **Context:** Advances in gene expression analysis have
              revolutionized our understanding of complex traits, revealing the
              critical role of gene modules in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. However, directly identifying these modules and
              understanding their roles is challenging due to the complexity of
              biological systems.


              **Content:** This study presents a novel approach, PhenoPLIER,
              that utilizes gene co-expression analysis to identify
              disease-associated gene modules and predict drug-disease
              relationships. PhenoPLIER integrates data from a CRISPR screen
              targeting lipid metabolism, allowing us to prioritize genes that
              are involved in disease while being missed by traditional
              single-gene approaches. By clustering genes based on their
              co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER reveals novel
              disease-associated molecular networks, providing mechanistic
              insights into disease etiology and paving the way for novel
              therapeutic strategies.


              **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER unveils a comprehensive understanding
              of disease etiology and drug mechanisms by contextualizing genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules. This innovative
              approach enhances our ability to identify potential therapeutic
              targets and provides a valuable tool for advancing our
              understanding of complex diseases.

              Genes operate in concert to regulate complex traits, but the exact

              patterns: a novel framework for disease etiology and drug
              repurposing**


              This study investigates the role of gene expression patterns in
              disease etiology and drug repurposing. We leverage the
              co-expression of genes in relevant cell types to identify
              disease-associated gene modules and uncover the underlying
              mechanisms of action. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes
              into a clustering algorithm, PhenoPLIER reveals novel targets for
              therapeutic intervention. Our approach successfully predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the molecular
              mechanisms underlying disease etiology. We demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for interpreting genetic
              associations and uncovering hidden relationships that are missed
              by traditional single-gene approaches.

              complex traits by leveraging the power of co-expression analysis.
              It seeks to identify disease-associated gene modules and elucidate
              the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug

              gene expression patterns and discover disease-associated gene
              modules. PhenoPLIER utilizes a clustering approach that considers
              both the spatial and temporal relationships between genes. Our
              method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals
              novel drug-disease relationships by prioritizing genes associated
              with specific trait clusters. We further explore lipid regulation

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              Genes operate in intricate concert to regulate gene expression
              across diverse contexts. We present a novel approach that
              comprehensively characterizes the genetic landscape of
              disease-associated cell types. By integrating a CRISPR screen with
              machine learning, we identify lipid regulators that are enriched
              in disease-associated modules. PhenoPLIER provides a robust
              framework for interpreting genetic associations by revealing
              previously overlooked patterns and prioritizing potential targets
              missed by traditional single-gene approaches. This approach

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**


              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for
              integrating gene expression and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER reveals
              significant associations between diseases and specific gene
              modules, highlighting disease mechanisms and drug repurposing
              targets. By clustering complex traits based on gene expression
              patterns, we identify genes that are critical for disease
              pathogenesis. Functional validation using a CRISPR screen on lipid
              regulation demonstrates the importance of these genes in disease
              etiology. Our approach provides a powerful tool for understanding
              disease etiology, predicting drug-disease relationships, and
              identifying novel therapeutic targets.

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              different conditions, revealing the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the
              mechanisms of action of novel therapeutic agents. Additionally, by
              analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identify

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes

              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              **Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns
              Uncovers Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**


              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified representation
              for comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER identifies
              disease-associated gene modules based on shared expression
              patterns across relevant cell types, revealing the role of
              specific gene groups in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By
              leveraging a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we
              demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering functionally
              important genes that are missed by traditional approaches. Our
              findings provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis and pave
              the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent

              different conditions, revealing the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies novel
              drug targets by prioritizing modules of genes associated with
              specific diseases. This approach provides novel insights into

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              PhenoPLIER is an innovative computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER
              utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              different conditions to identify disease-relevant gene modules. We
              demonstrate the efficacy of PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid
              regulation using a CRISPR screen and finding that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. This approach provides new insights into
              disease mechanisms and opens avenues for drug discovery and
              personalized medicine.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              identifies disease mechanisms and drug repurposing targets**


              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              for integrating and analyzing transcriptome-wide association data,
              drug perturbation, and phenotypic information to identify disease
              mechanisms and predict drug repurposing targets. PhenoPLIER
              leverages the power of modular analysis to group genes with
              similar expression patterns across different conditions,
              uncovering disease-associated gene modules that are enriched in
              specific cell types. By integrating this information with drug
              perturbation data, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we leverage a CRISPR screen to validate the
              functional importance of specific genes within these modules,
              providing insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing
              opportunities.

              **Context:** This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This approach enables the
              identification of disease-relevant gene modules and the prediction
              of drug-disease relationships and therapeutic targets.


              **Content:** PhenoPLIER employs a novel approach to integrate and
              analyze genetic and phenotypic data. It constructs a latent
              representation of gene expression patterns and drug perturbation
              effects, capturing shared patterns across different conditions.
              This representation facilitates the identification of
              disease-associated gene modules and the discovery of novel
              drug-disease relationships.


              **Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for
              understanding the complex interplay between genetic and
              environmental factors in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By
              integrating multiple data sources, it enables a comprehensive
              analysis of disease etiology and opens new avenues for disease
              treatment and drug discovery.

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
              captures the expression patterns of modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions, enabling the
              identification of disease-relevant molecular mechanisms.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates the mechanisms of action for a subset of diseases by
              prioritizing genes in trait-associated modules.

              **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene expression data, drug-disease relationships, and
              pharmacological perturbation information into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages the
              modular nature of gene expression patterns to identify
              disease-associated gene modules, highlighting the importance of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug response. By
              integrating functional genomics and drug repurposing data,
              PhenoPLIER provides mechanistic insights into complex traits and
              facilitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Our
              approach successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates the mechanisms of action for lipid-related diseases,
              demonstrating its potential to advance our understanding of
              disease etiology and accelerate the development of personalized
              therapies.

              **Context:** Advances in gene expression analysis have revealed
              the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. However, existing models of complex trait
              architecture predict that these interactions are essential for

              **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              identifies disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


              This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation captures the functional relationships between genes
              and disease outcomes. PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated
              gene modules and predicts drug-disease relationships, providing
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By integrating
              multiple data sources, including transcriptome-wide association
              studies, functional genomics, and CRISPR screens, PhenoPLIER
              enhances our understanding of complex traits and facilitates the
              development of novel therapeutic strategies.

              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
