**Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Computational Approach to Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**

**Introduction:**
Understanding the interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, it has been proposed that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. This motivated us to develop PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation.

**Methods:**
We employed PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions to uncover disease-associated gene networks. Our approach integrates groups of co-expressed genes to provide a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. We validated our findings using a CRISPR screen and identified lipid regulators that were consistently associated with disease but missed by single-gene approaches.

**Results:**
PhenoPLIER successfully predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred drug mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we identified novel targets that were not identified by single-gene strategies. These findings provide new insights into the etiology of complex diseases and pave the way for the development of more effective therapies.

**Conclusion:**
PhenoPLIER is a powerful computational tool that effectively integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach enables the discovery of disease-associated gene networks and facilitates the identification of novel therapeutic targets. By contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between genes and disease.

**PhenoPLIER: A computational framework for mapping genetic associations and drug mechanisms through gene expression patterns**

**Introduction:**
PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait association data with pharmacological perturbation information to construct a unified representation of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This representation captures the shared expression patterns of genes across different conditions, enabling the identification of disease-associated gene modules.

**Method:**
We use a combination of transcriptome-wide association studies and CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation. Our approach involves clustering of genes with similar expression patterns, resulting in the identification of gene modules enriched in disease-associated conditions. We then use these modules to predict drug-disease pairs and infer the mechanisms of action.

**Results:**
Our analysis reveals that disease associations are highly enriched in specific gene modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We prioritize genes involved in lipid metabolism, as they are consistently associated with disease but are often missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

**Discussion:**
PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of how genetic associations and drug mechanisms are integrated into complex traits. By capturing the shared expression patterns of genes across conditions, our approach identifies novel therapeutic targets and provides insights into the interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors in disease development.

**Conclusion:**
PhenoPLIER is a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationship between genetics, drug development, and disease etiology. By integrating multiple data sources, our approach offers a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and provides new avenues for disease research and therapeutics.

**PhenoPLIER: A computational approach to mapping gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms from high-dimensional data**

PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates gene expression patterns, drug perturbation data, and phenotypic trait information into a unified latent representation. This approach enables the identification of disease-associated gene modules and the elucidation of their roles in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

By leveraging the co-expression of genes across various conditions, PhenoPLIER can capture the intricate interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors that contribute to complex traits. This approach reveals novel disease-associated gene modules that are missed by traditional single-gene analysis.

Through a comprehensive analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we demonstrate that functional protein candidates associated with the disease are not enriched in gene modules identified by PhenoPLIER. However, these genes are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules, suggesting their critical role in disease pathogenesis.

**Context:** Traditional approaches to understanding the etiology of complex diseases have focused on studying individual genes and their roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

**Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a unique approach to integrate multi-omic data into a single, interpretable representation. This approach allows us to identify gene modules with coordinated expression patterns across different conditions, revealing potential disease mechanisms. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach provides new insights into the etiology of complex diseases by uncovering gene modules that are involved in both genetic associations and drug response.

**PhenoPLIER: A computational approach to map gene-trait associations and drug repurposing targets**

**Introduction**

Understanding how genes influence complex traits is critical for developing new therapies. Recent studies have shown that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, traditional approaches to gene-trait association studies have limitations in capturing these complex interactions.

**Methods**

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and drug repurposing targets into a common latent representation. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

**Results**

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

**Discussion**

PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for understanding the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug repurposing. Our approach provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of complex traits and identifies potential therapeutic targets that are missed by traditional approaches.
