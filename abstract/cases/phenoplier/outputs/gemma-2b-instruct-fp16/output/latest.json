PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules by leveraging the shared expression patterns of genes with similar functional roles. Our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for several diseases. Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying functionally important genes that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches.\n\nKey differences between the input and revised paragraphs include:\n\n* The revised paragraph provides a more concise and focused overview of the study's key findings.\n* It emphasizes the importance of gene modules in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n* It highlights the accuracy and utility of PhenoPLIER in both predicting known drug-disease pairs and identifying novel therapeutic targets.\n* It introduces the CRISPR screen results as a concrete example of PhenoPLIER's ability to identify functionally important genes.\n* The revised paragraph is more engaging and accessible to a wider audience."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This approach reveals the context of genetic associations by grouping co-expressed genes into modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions. PhenoPLIER can identify disease-associated modules and predict drug-disease pairs and drug repurposing strategies. By integrating co-expression data with traditional genetics approaches, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for understanding and interrogating genetic associations."

By mapping these associations to a common latent representation, PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules that are enriched in specific cell types, providing insights into disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nUsing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes associated with disease are often missed by single-gene approaches but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.

PhenoPLIER utilizes a gene co-expression network to cluster genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. By analyzing this network, we identify disease-associated gene modules and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. We further validate our findings using a CRISPR screen, uncovering lipid-related genes that are functionally important but missed by single-gene approaches.\n\nOur approach offers several advantages. First, it integrates data from multiple sources, including transcriptomics, genomics, and pharmacology. Second, it utilizes a novel multi-scale approach that captures both individual gene expression patterns and the co-expression network. Third, it provides a robust and reliable method for identifying disease-associated gene modules and prioritizing therapeutic targets.\n\nBy combining these methods, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between genetic variation, disease etiology, and drug repurposing. This framework can be applied to elucidate the mechanisms underlying complex traits and develop novel therapeutic strategies for a wide range of diseases."

PhenoPLIER utilizes a modular approach to jointly analyze gene expression patterns, drug perturbation data, and functional genomic information. By identifying co-expressed gene modules, the algorithm reveals disease-associated gene clusters enriched in specific cell types, highlighting the importance of specific cellular processes in disease pathogenesis. Additionally, PhenoPLIER identifies drug-disease associations by predicting target genes based on their coordinated expression patterns and disease relevance. Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to validate the role of specific lipid regulators in disease pathogenesis, highlighting the potential of PhenoPLIER in uncovering novel therapeutic targets."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

It facilitates a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms by capturing the interactions between genes operating in concert.\n\nOur approach consists of grouping co-expressed genes based on their expression patterns across different conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates disease mechanisms. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important genes that are excluded from single-gene association analyses but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.\n\nBy incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, uncovering novel targets missed by traditional single-gene approaches. This framework provides a deeper mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and offers promising avenues for drug repurposing and personalized medicine."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

By leveraging the co-expression of genes across different conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies robust molecular mechanisms associated with disease etiology and drug repurposing.\n\nOur approach leverages the modularity of gene expression to uncover disease-relevant gene modules. By clustering genes with similar expression patterns, we identify modules enriched in disease-associated cell types. Importantly, we prioritize genes within these modules based on their relevance to trait prediction and drug repurposing.\n\nThe PhenoPLIER framework utilizes a CRISPR screen to validate the functional importance of specific lipid regulators. Unexpectedly, we observe that functionally significant genes are often excluded from these modules, underscoring the importance of considering the collective behavior of co-expressed genes in disease etiology.\n\nThrough the integration of co-expression and drug repurposing data, PhenoPLIER unveils novel molecular mechanisms that contribute to disease pathogenesis. By capturing the intricate interplay between genes and their environmental cues, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for disease discovery and personalized medicine."

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

By leveraging the modular nature of gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules across different cell types. This approach enables the identification of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities by integrating mechanistic insights into genetic association studies.\n\nOur framework utilizes a novel approach to integrate co-expression information into the latent representation. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.\n\nOur analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen exemplifies the application of PhenoPLIER in a real-world setting. We identify functionally important genes that lack associations but are strongly enriched in trait-associated modules. This observation underscores the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns for a complete understanding of disease etiology.\n\n**Key improvements:**\n\n* **Stronger title:** More concise and accurately reflects the content of the manuscript.\n* **Rewritten abstract:** Provides a clear and concise overview of the research question, methodology, results, and conclusions.\n* **Emphasis on novelty:** Highlighting the unique features and advantages of PhenoPLIER over existing methods.\n* **Integration of key results:** Focusing on the most significant findings and their implications for disease understanding and drug development.\n* **Improved flow and organization:** Using headings and subheadings to organize the abstract and improve readability."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This approach enables the exploration of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms by capturing the shared transcriptional signatures of disease-associated gene modules. By identifying genes co-regulated across multiple conditions, PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of novel therapeutic targets and provides insights into the interplay between genetic variations and environmental factors in disease development.\n\nThe approach leverages the observation that diseases are often associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By constructing a module-based representation of gene expression, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for these treatments. Furthermore, by integrating lipid regulation data, PhenoPLIER identifies genes that are functionally important but missed by traditional single-gene approaches.\n\nThis study demonstrates the power of PhenoPLIER in uncovering complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms. It provides a novel framework for understanding genetic associations and offers insights into the interplay between genetic variations and environmental factors in disease development."

By integrating these insights, PhenoPLIER facilitates the discovery of novel drug-disease pairs and illuminates the intricate relationships between genetic variants and phenotypic traits. This approach expands our understanding of disease mechanisms by integrating multiple data sources and providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of complex traits.\""

We leverage a unique approach that integrates co-expression analysis with functional genomics to identify drug-disease pairs and elucidate their mechanisms of action. Our results provide a novel framework for understanding genetic associations by contextualizing them within the framework of gene modules. We show that PhenoPLIER, a clustering algorithm that focuses on co-expression relationships, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies novel drug-disease relationships that were missed by traditional single-gene approaches. We also demonstrate that co-expression analysis is a valuable tool for uncovering disease mechanisms, providing insights into the complex interplay between genes and diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

By combining data from CRISPR screens and pathway analysis, we identify lipid regulators that are essential for disease etiology but are not prioritized by traditional single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER integrates gene co-expression and phenotypic data to generate context-specific gene expression profiles that reveal novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Recent research has highlighted the importance of understanding how specific genes contribute to disease pathogenesis and develop novel therapeutic approaches.\n\n**Content**\n\nThis study presents a novel approach to understand disease etiology and drug targets by leveraging the power of gene co-expression analysis. We identified disease-associated gene modules by integrating a CRISPR screen with a clustering algorithm, PhenoPLIER. Our results provide new insights into disease mechanisms by revealing that functionally important genes are often missed by single-gene analyses. Moreover, we show that co-expression analysis can uncover novel drug-disease pairs and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy integrating groups of co-expressed genes into a cluster analysis framework, PhenoPLIER unveils a deeper understanding of disease etiology and facilitates the identification of potential therapeutic targets. This approach provides a novel perspective on understanding complex traits and holds promise for developing innovative therapies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Determining how specific gene modules influence complex traits requires a deep mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.\n\n**Content:** We present a novel approach that comprehensively investigates the association between diseases and gene expression patterns. We use a CRISPR screen to identify lipid-related genes that are enriched in disease-associated modules. By integrating these modules into PhenoPLIER, a clustering algorithm for co-expression analysis, we reveal a group of genes with significant associations but absent single-gene signatures. Functional validation of these genes suggests that they play crucial roles in disease etiology. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by considering gene co-expression and integrating it into the analysis of complex traits.\n\n**Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression for a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach has important implications for developing new therapeutic strategies by identifying potential targets that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches."

By integrating group co-expression data into the PhenoPLIER framework, we uncover previously missed genetic associations and prioritize genes involved in complex traits. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations by integrating multiple levels of gene expression and drug response."

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

By identifying groups of genes that are consistently co-expressed across different cell types, we gain insights into disease etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets.\n\n**Content**\n\nWe develop a novel method to identify drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action through clustering of co-expressed genes. Our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies novel therapeutic targets. We leverage this method to investigate the role of lipid regulation in disease etiology and identify genes involved in a specific disease subtype.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, allowing researchers to identify both known and novel drug-disease relationships and to infer the mechanisms of action for these relationships. This approach can significantly advance our understanding of complex diseases and contribute to the development of new therapies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, integrates transcriptome-wide association and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation reveals that diseases are associated with gene modules enriched in specific cell types, indicating that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying drug actions through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. By integrating diverse data sources, PhenoPLIER provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between genetic variations and environmental cues that contribute to disease susceptibility and therapeutic response."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

PhenoPLIER constructs a shared latent representation for gene expression patterns across multiple conditions, revealing disease-associated gene modules that contribute to disease etiology and drug response. Through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, we demonstrate the importance of specific genes within these modules for disease manifestation.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This approach reveals disease-associated gene modules and facilitates the identification of novel drug repurposing opportunities. PhenoPLIER leverages the co-expression of genes with similar expression patterns to uncover disease mechanisms. By integrating gene expression data with drug repurposing information, we prioritize genes that are involved in both disease etiology and drug response. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention."

However, modern models of disease etiology predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease initiation and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER revealed that disease-associated gene modules are enriched in specific cell types and are involved in drug-disease mechanisms. Moreover, a CRISPR screen revealed that functionally important genes lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits and suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease etiology."

This approach allows for the identification of gene modules that are associated with specific diseases and that may mediate the effects of therapeutic interventions. We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen and identifying genes that are important for a specific disease but are not associated with changes in gene expression. We then use PhenoPLIER to predict drug-disease relationships and to infer mechanisms of action. Our approach provides a powerful tool for understanding the interplay between genes, drugs, and diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

PhenoPLIER enables the discovery of gene modules associated with complex traits, provides insights into disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery, and facilitates the development of novel therapeutic strategies.\n\nUsing a comprehensive dataset that integrates gene expression, genetic association, and pharmacological perturbation data, we identify gene modules enriched in diseases. We demonstrate that these modules are relevant to specific cell types and can be targeted to modulate disease progression. We further validate our findings using a CRISPR screen, highlighting the importance of genes within these modules for disease etiology.\n\nBy leveraging the power of PhenoPLIER, we uncover novel disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets that were previously missed by single-gene approaches.

By integrating co-expression data with traditional genetics approaches, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for understanding and interrogating genetic associations.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

PhenoPLIER utilizes a gene co-expression network to cluster genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. By analyzing this network, we identify disease-associated gene modules and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. We further validate our findings using a CRISPR screen, uncovering lipid-related genes that are functionally important but missed by single-gene approaches.\n\nOur approach offers several advantages. First, it integrates data from multiple sources, including transcriptomics, genomics, and pharmacology. Second, it utilizes a novel multi-scale approach that captures both individual gene expression patterns and the co-expression network. Third, it provides a robust and reliable method for identifying disease-associated gene modules and prioritizing therapeutic targets.\n\nBy combining these methods, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between genetic variation, disease etiology, and drug repurposing. This framework can be applied to elucidate the mechanisms underlying complex traits and develop novel therapeutic strategies for a wide range of diseases.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

PhenoPLIER leverages gene co-expression and drug-disease associations to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms. It identifies disease-associated gene modules based on consistent gene expression patterns across multiple cell types. By integrating these modules, PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of potential therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

By leveraging the modular nature of gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated gene modules across different cell types. This approach enables the identification of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities by integrating mechanistic insights into genetic association studies.\n\nOur framework utilizes a novel approach to integrate co-expression information into the latent representation. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.\n\nOur analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen exemplifies the application of PhenoPLIER in a real-world setting. We identify functionally important genes that lack associations but are strongly enriched in trait-associated modules. This observation underscores the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns for a complete understanding of disease etiology.\n\n**Key improvements:**\n\n* **Stronger title:** More concise and accurately reflects the content of the manuscript.\n* **Rewritten abstract:** Provides a clear and concise overview of the research question, methodology, results, and conclusions.\n* **Emphasis on novelty:** Highlighting the unique features and advantages of PhenoPLIER over existing methods.\n* **Integration of key results:** Focusing on the most significant findings and their implications for disease understanding and drug development.\n* **Improved flow and organization:** Using headings and subheadings to organize the abstract and improve readability.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

By leveraging the co-expression of genes across different conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies disease-associated modules of genes, enabling mechanistic understanding of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach reveals novel therapeutic targets that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches, highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions in disease pathogenesis.\n\nKey features of PhenoPLIER include:\n\n- **Integration of gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data:** PhenoPLIER combines the knowledge from both genetic studies and functional genomics, providing a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology.\n- **Modular representation:** Genes are grouped based on their expression patterns, allowing for the identification of disease-associated modules that regulate specific cellular processes.\n- **High-accuracy predictions:** PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action by prioritizing modules associated with disease traits.\n- **CRISPR screen validation:** The approach is validated by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, demonstrating the importance of functional genes in disease.\n- **Contextualization of genetic associations:** PhenoPLIER provides a framework for interpreting genetic associations by highlighting the interplay between co-expressed genes, providing insights into disease mechanisms that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER is a powerful tool for understanding genetic associations and drug mechanisms by leveraging the co-expression of genes to identify disease-associated modules and prioritize therapeutic targets.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

We observe that diseases are associated with specific gene modules that are co-expressed in relevant cell types. These modules represent novel therapeutic targets and provide insights into disease pathways. By integrating these insights, PhenoPLIER facilitates the discovery of novel drug-disease pairs and illuminates the intricate relationships between genetic variants and phenotypic traits. This approach expands our understanding of disease mechanisms by integrating multiple data sources and providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of complex traits.\"",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Recent research has highlighted the importance of understanding how specific genes contribute to disease pathogenesis and develop novel therapeutic approaches.\n\n**Content**\n\nThis study presents a novel approach to understand disease etiology and drug targets by leveraging the power of gene co-expression analysis. We identified disease-associated gene modules by integrating a CRISPR screen with a clustering algorithm, PhenoPLIER. Our results provide new insights into disease mechanisms by revealing that functionally important genes are often missed by single-gene analyses. Moreover, we show that co-expression analysis can uncover novel drug-disease pairs and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy integrating groups of co-expressed genes into a cluster analysis framework, PhenoPLIER unveils a deeper understanding of disease etiology and facilitates the identification of potential therapeutic targets. This approach provides a novel perspective on understanding complex traits and holds promise for developing innovative therapies.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Determining how specific gene modules influence complex traits requires a deep mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.\n\n**Content:** We present a novel approach that comprehensively investigates the association between diseases and gene expression patterns. We use a CRISPR screen to identify lipid-related genes that are enriched in disease-associated modules. By integrating these modules into PhenoPLIER, a clustering algorithm for co-expression analysis, we reveal a group of genes with significant associations but absent single-gene signatures. Functional validation of these genes suggests that they play crucial roles in disease etiology. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by considering gene co-expression and integrating it into the analysis of complex traits.\n\n**Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression for a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach has important implications for developing new therapeutic strategies by identifying potential targets that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

This approach enables the identification of disease-relevant modules of genes expressed across multiple cell types, providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts drug-disease pairs and identifies novel therapeutic targets by prioritizing genes that are enriched in trait-associated modules. By integrating multiple data sources, PhenoPLIER facilitates a deeper understanding of complex traits and accelerates the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, modern models of disease etiology predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease initiation and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER revealed that disease-associated gene modules are enriched in specific cell types and are involved in drug-disease mechanisms. Moreover, a CRISPR screen revealed that functionally important genes lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits and suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease etiology.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",
