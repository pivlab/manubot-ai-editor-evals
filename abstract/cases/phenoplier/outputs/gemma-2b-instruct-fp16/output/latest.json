Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

It employs a modular approach to represent gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms in a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER leverages the co-expression of genes within modules to prioritize disease-relevant genes and identify novel drug-disease pairs. Through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER reveals that lipid-related genes are consistently associated with disease, but their associations are not captured by single-gene methods. By integrating co-expression data, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

This approach enables the identification of disease-associated gene modules and the inference of drug repurposing mechanisms from complex traits. PhenoPLIER utilizes a modular approach to capture the spatial and temporal relationships between genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. By analyzing gene co-expression and drug perturbation data, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes that are significantly associated with disease. These modules can be linked to known drug-disease pairs and provide insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing strategies.\n\nKey features of PhenoPLIER include:\n\n- Integration of multiple data sources: Transcriptome-wide association studies and pharmacological perturbation data are combined into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n- Modular approach: Genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions are grouped into modules to capture spatial and temporal relationships.\n- Disease-focused analysis: PhenoPLIER identifies gene modules that are significantly associated with disease, enabling the identification of potential disease targets.\n- Drug repurposing insights: The approach can infer drug repurposing mechanisms from disease-associated gene modules, providing insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions."

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses this challenge by mapping gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes to capture shared patterns of expression across diverse conditions, enabling the discovery of disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We validate the performance of PhenoPLIER on a large dataset of genetic studies, drug-disease pairs, and CRISPR screen data, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict known associations and identify novel drug-disease relationships. PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for researchers investigating the complex interplay between genes and the environment in disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": "**Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Computational Approach to Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms**\n\n**Introduction:**\nUnderstanding the interplay between genes and their roles in complex traits is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, it has been proposed that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. This motivated us to develop PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation.\n\n**Methods:**\nWe employed PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions to uncover disease-associated gene networks. Our approach integrates groups of co-expressed genes to provide a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. We validated our findings using a CRISPR screen and identified lipid regulators that were consistently associated with disease but missed by single-gene approaches.\n\n**Results:**\nPhenoPLIER successfully predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred drug mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we identified novel targets that were not identified by single-gene strategies. These findings provide new insights into the etiology of complex diseases and pave the way for the development of more effective therapies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPhenoPLIER is a powerful computational tool that effectively integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach enables the discovery of disease-associated gene networks and facilitates the identification of novel therapeutic targets. By contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between genes and disease."

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This representation captures the shared expression patterns of genes across different conditions, enabling the identification of disease-associated gene modules.\n\n**Method:**\nWe use a combination of transcriptome-wide association studies and CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation. Our approach involves clustering of genes with similar expression patterns, resulting in the identification of gene modules enriched in disease-associated conditions. We then use these modules to predict drug-disease pairs and infer the mechanisms of action.\n\n**Results:**\nOur analysis reveals that disease associations are highly enriched in specific gene modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We prioritize genes involved in lipid metabolism, as they are consistently associated with disease but are often missed by traditional single-gene approaches.\n\n**Discussion:**\nPhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of how genetic associations and drug mechanisms are integrated into complex traits. By capturing the shared expression patterns of genes across conditions, our approach identifies novel therapeutic targets and provides insights into the interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors in disease development.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPhenoPLIER is a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationship between genetics, drug development, and disease etiology. By integrating multiple data sources, our approach offers a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and provides new avenues for disease research and therapeutics."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

By leveraging the power of gene co-expression and drug perturbation data, PhenoPLIER constructs a shared latent representation that captures the underlying relationships between genes, conditions, and phenotypes. This approach enables the identification of novel drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.\n\nOur analysis reveals that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in specific cell types, highlighting the importance of context-dependent gene regulation. We prioritize genes within these modules based on their functional relevance, revealing a subset of genes with significant drug-disease associations that are missed by traditional single-gene approaches. Through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid metabolism, we further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering functionally important genes that play a crucial role in disease etiology.\n\nBy integrating multi-omic data, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach offers novel insights into disease-related mechanisms, facilitates the identification of novel drug-disease pairs, and aids in the development of personalized therapies."

Our analysis reveals that diseases are associated with gene modules specifically expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting the importance of considering context in understanding disease etiology. We further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by uncovering lipid-related genes that are missed by traditional gene-trait association studies.\n\n**Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of complex trait regulation by integrating co-expression and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach facilitates the discovery of disease etiology and drug mechanisms by prioritizing genes that are co-regulated and enriched in trait-associated modules."

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to identify co-expression modules have limitations. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates data on gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER utilizes a novel approach to generate a joint latent representation that captures co-expression patterns across different conditions. This representation facilitates the identification of gene modules enriched in disease-associated cell types and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits. We demonstrate the efficacy of PhenoPLIER on a dataset of human lipid disorders, revealing known drug-disease pairs and elucidating novel therapeutic targets."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.\n\n**Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a unique approach to integrate multi-omic data into a single, interpretable representation. This approach allows us to identify gene modules with coordinated expression patterns across different conditions, revealing potential disease mechanisms. By analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach provides new insights into the etiology of complex diseases by uncovering gene modules that are involved in both genetic associations and drug response."

This approach enables the identification of disease-associated gene modules and the elucidation of their roles in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nBy leveraging the co-expression of genes across various conditions, PhenoPLIER can capture the intricate interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors that contribute to complex traits. This approach reveals novel disease-associated gene modules that are missed by traditional single-gene analysis.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we demonstrate that functional protein candidates associated with the disease are not enriched in gene modules identified by PhenoPLIER. However, these genes are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules, suggesting their critical role in disease pathogenesis.\n\n**Keywords:**\n- Genetic studies\n- Functional genomics\n- Gene co-expression\n- Therapeutic targets\n- Drug repurposing\n- Clustering of complex traits"

It employs a modular approach to represent gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms in a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER leverages the co-expression of genes within modules to prioritize disease-relevant genes and identify novel drug-disease pairs. Through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER reveals that lipid-related genes are consistently associated with disease, but their associations are not captured by single-gene methods. By integrating co-expression data, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

These modules are associated with known drug-disease pairs and provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, existing methods for mapping gene-trait associations and integrating them into disease models are often limited by the lack of a common representation across different conditions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses this challenge by mapping gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common latent representation. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes to capture shared patterns of expression across diverse conditions, enabling the discovery of disease-associated molecular mechanisms. We validate the performance of PhenoPLIER on a large dataset of genetic studies, drug-disease pairs, and CRISPR screen data, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict known associations and identify novel drug-disease relationships. PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for researchers investigating the complex interplay between genes and the environment in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, it has been proposed that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. This motivated us to develop PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation.\n\n**Methods:**\nWe employed PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions to uncover disease-associated gene networks. Our approach integrates groups of co-expressed genes to provide a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. We validated our findings using a CRISPR screen and identified lipid regulators that were consistently associated with disease but missed by single-gene approaches.\n\n**Results:**\nPhenoPLIER successfully predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred drug mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we identified novel targets that were not identified by single-gene strategies. These findings provide new insights into the etiology of complex diseases and pave the way for the development of more effective therapies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPhenoPLIER is a powerful computational tool that effectively integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach enables the discovery of disease-associated gene networks and facilitates the identification of novel therapeutic targets. By contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between genes and disease.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This representation captures the shared expression patterns of genes across different conditions, enabling the identification of disease-associated gene modules.\n\n**Method:**\nWe use a combination of transcriptome-wide association studies and CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation. Our approach involves clustering of genes with similar expression patterns, resulting in the identification of gene modules enriched in disease-associated conditions. We then use these modules to predict drug-disease pairs and infer the mechanisms of action.\n\n**Results:**\nOur analysis reveals that disease associations are highly enriched in specific gene modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We prioritize genes involved in lipid metabolism, as they are consistently associated with disease but are often missed by traditional single-gene approaches.\n\n**Discussion:**\nPhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of how genetic associations and drug mechanisms are integrated into complex traits. By capturing the shared expression patterns of genes across conditions, our approach identifies novel therapeutic targets and provides insights into the interplay between genetic variants and environmental factors in disease development.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPhenoPLIER is a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationship between genetics, drug development, and disease etiology.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

PhenoPLIER integrates multi-omic data to uncover relationships between genes and traits, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.\n\n**Content:** PhenoPLIER utilizes a unique approach to analyze gene-trait associations and drug-disease relationships. By combining transcriptome-wide association studies and CRISPR screening, PhenoPLIER identifies key genes involved in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach reveals that co-expression patterns provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms, missed by conventional single-gene analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for understanding the complex interplay between genetic variations and disease phenotypes. By integrating multiple data sources, it identifies novel targets and facilitates the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.",

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

We leverage the co-expression of genes to identify disease-relevant mechanisms. Our approach, PhenoPLIER, maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation captures co-expression patterns and facilitates the identification of potential therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER outperforms traditional approaches in predicting drug-disease pairs and elucidating disease mechanisms. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and enables the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
