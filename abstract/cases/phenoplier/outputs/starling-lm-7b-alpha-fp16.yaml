          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to

      response:
        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanisms of expression regulation across varying conditions. Insights into this aspect are crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in deciphering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes with analogous expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially unveiling therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and highlighting disease mechanisms.'

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           In a coordinated manner, genes interact with one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanisms of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

        output: ' Complex traits, such as diseases, are influenced by the coordinated actions of multiple genes in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes regulate expression across different conditions is essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding how genes collaborate to influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for advancing new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thus highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' The field of genetic studies has long sought to unravel the complex interactions between genes and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, traditional single-gene approaches have been limited in their ability to account for gene-gene interactions that are critical to understanding disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on the identification of modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions, which have been shown to be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action, and even prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but are found within trait-associated modules.

           We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes function collaboratively in specific contexts to execute their tasks. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across varying conditions, which is critical for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated individual gene roles in disease-related mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital to understanding disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets missed by single-gene methods. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In this revised paragraph, we have emphasized the importance of
          understanding gene regulation across different conditions, which is
          critical for developing new therapies. Additionally, we have
          highlighted the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          have included a CRISPR screen example to illustrate the prioritization
          of functionally important players by PhenoPLIER. Finally, we have
          reiterated that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, while also
          emphasizing its role in providing a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

           We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent framework for comprehensive analysis. Understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions is essential for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital for understanding disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which has significant implications for disease etiology and drug mechanisms research.

          The revised abstract emphasizes the importance of understanding how
          genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions. It
          highlights that PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Additionally, the revised abstract mentions
          the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. The conclusion emphasizes that by
          incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits. This insight is pivotal for the development of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in determining disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across shared conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets often missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           Genes function in coordinated networks to regulate complex traits, and understanding the mechanisms behind their expression patterns across different conditions is vital for developing targeted therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players exhibit no associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. This novel framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing innovative therapies. Our study demonstrates that gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are significantly associated with diseases, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

        output: ' In the context of complex genetic traits, understanding how genes collaborate in specific situations is critical for developing targeted therapies. However, existing approaches struggle to capture these intricate relationships effectively. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns across different conditions. Our results demonstrate the significant association of diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show that functionally important players not associated with specific traits are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.

           Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific scenarios, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions for deciphering the influence of these genes on complex traits. This insight is crucial for advancing novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

        output: ' In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with one another to influence complex traits requires a comprehensive view of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing effective therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

           Genes interact with one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these interactions affect complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.'

           Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with comparable expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In this revised paragraph, the original text has been rephrased for
          clarity and coherence. The focus on gene-gene interactions and their
          role in disease onset and progression has been emphasized, along with
          the introduction of PhenoPLIER as a computational approach to map
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Additionally, the
          accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action has been highlighted, along with
          findings from CRISPR screening that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes act in concert to influence complex traits is essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly by revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but are included in trait-associated modules. This study not only fills the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions but also provides a novel method for uncovering therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms related to complex traits and diseases.'

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for devising innovative therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play an essential part in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal significant links between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial elements lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Understanding the collective action of genes in specific contexts is essential for elucidating their roles in complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions, thereby revealing disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action while prioritizing functionally important players that lack associations but are incorporated into trait-associated modules. Overall, our approach offers a novel framework for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms by leveraging gene co-expression patterns and functional genomics data, paving the way for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing strategies.'

            text: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanisms of expression regulation across varying conditions. Insights into this aspect are crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in deciphering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes with analogous expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this

            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, as this knowledge is essential for developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally critical players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

               In a coordinated manner, genes interact with one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanisms of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across different conditions to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits. This insight is essential for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferential mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns is crucial for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, transcriptome-wide association studies have focused on individual genes, overlooking the potential impact of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding how genes collaborate to influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for advancing new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thus highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               The field of genetic studies has long sought to unravel the complex interactions between genes and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, traditional single-gene approaches have been limited in their ability to account for gene-gene interactions that are critical to understanding disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on the identification of modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions, which have been shown to be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action, and even prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but are found within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, offering a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes function collaboratively in specific contexts to execute their tasks. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across varying conditions, which is critical for novel therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated individual gene roles in disease-related mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital to understanding disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets missed by single-gene methods. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In this revised paragraph, we have emphasized the importance of
              understanding gene regulation across different conditions, which
              is critical for developing new therapies. Additionally, we have
              highlighted the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we have included a CRISPR screen example to
              illustrate the prioritization of functionally important players by
              PhenoPLIER. Finally, we have reiterated that incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and identify potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, while also emphasizing its role in providing a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

               In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Current approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have focused on individual genes, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions, which are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action and prioritizing functionally important players in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known

               We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits. This insight is pivotal for the development of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in determining disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across shared conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets often missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes function in coordinated networks to regulate complex traits, and understanding the mechanisms behind their expression patterns across different conditions is vital for developing targeted therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players exhibit no associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. This novel framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing innovative therapies. Our study demonstrates that gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are significantly associated with diseases, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               In the context of complex genetic traits, understanding how genes collaborate in specific situations is critical for developing targeted therapies. However, existing approaches struggle to capture these intricate relationships effectively. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that leverages gene co-expression patterns across different conditions. Our results demonstrate the significant association of diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show that functionally important players not associated with specific traits are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a transformative approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in the pursuit of novel therapies.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific scenarios, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions for deciphering the influence of these genes on complex traits. This insight is crucial for advancing novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               In the realm of genetic studies, understanding how genes collaborate to influence complex traits requires a comprehensive analysis of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. We utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discovered that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets that might be overlooked by single-gene strategies and significantly contributing to the broader understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genetic studies have long sought to understand the complex interplay of genes in determining traits and diseases. However, current approaches have not fully captured gene-gene interactions, which are believed to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing for more accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inference of mechanisms of action. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to fill gaps in the current understanding of gene interactions and their roles in disease etiology and therapeutic targets, thereby contributing to advancements in functional genomics and drug repurposing.

              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with comparable expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In this revised paragraph, the original text has been rephrased
              for clarity and coherence. The focus on gene-gene interactions and
              their role in disease onset and progression has been emphasized,
              along with the introduction of PhenoPLIER as a computational
              approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Additionally, the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action has
              been highlighted, along with findings from CRISPR screening that
              functionally important players lack associations but are

               In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes act in concert to influence complex traits is essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly by revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but are included in trait-associated modules. This study not only fills the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions but also provides a novel method for uncovering therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms related to complex traits and diseases.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for devising innovative therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play an essential part in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal significant links between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial elements lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific contexts. Understanding the influence of these genes on complex traits necessitates comprehending expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is vital for devising novel treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease initiation and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for simultaneous analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Understanding the collective action of genes in specific contexts is essential for elucidating their roles in complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions, thereby revealing disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action while prioritizing functionally important players that lack associations but are incorporated into trait-associated modules. Overall, our approach offers a novel framework for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms by leveraging gene co-expression patterns and functional genomics data, paving the way for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing strategies.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
