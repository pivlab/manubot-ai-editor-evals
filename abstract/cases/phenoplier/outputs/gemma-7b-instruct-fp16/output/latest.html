Sure, here is the revised abstract in a single paragraph following the C-C-C scheme:

Gene expression patterns serve as a foundation for understanding how genes act in concert to influence complex traits. Despite advancements in transcriptome-wide association studies, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations but identified in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, offering insights into potential drug targets and pathways missed by single-gene strategies.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Genetic associations with complex traits are often influenced by complex interactions among genes. To understand these interactions, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is essential. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation.

Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled &quot;Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms&quot;:

The complex nature of human diseases necessitates a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Gene expression patterns offer valuable insights into these mechanisms, but integrating this information with genetic associations remains a challenge. PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, bridges this gap by projecting genetic associations onto a common latent representation of gene expression patterns. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression profiles across various conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and paving the way for more effective drug repurposing.

Gene expression patterns offer valuable insights into these mechanisms, but integrating this information with genetic associations remains a challenge. PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, bridges this gap by projecting genetic associations onto a common latent representation of gene expression patterns. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression profiles across various conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and paving the way for more effective drug repurposing.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

The complex interplay of genetic factors and environmental influences shapes human traits and diseases. To uncover these intricate relationships, researchers have harnessed transcriptome-wide association studies, which have unveiled the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in complex trait architecture. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing new insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing strategies.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

Gene expression patterns provide a powerful framework for understanding complex traits. In this study, we demonstrate that genetic associations with complex traits are often attributable to co-expressed gene modules rather than individual genes. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of considering co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic associations and suggest that PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates gene modules, can identify potential therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

Genes orchestrate complex biological processes through coordinated expression patterns. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions is essential. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to complex trait architecture. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in specific cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Sure, here is the revised abstract:

Gene expression patterns orchestrate complex traits through coordinated gene activity. To decipher these patterns and translate them into therapeutic interventions, a mechanistic understanding of how genes interact in specific contexts is paramount. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, but their impact on complex traits necessitates a deeper exploration of gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This representation is anchored in modules of genes with similar expression patterns across diverse conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in disease-related pathways.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Genes act in coordinated networks to carry out specific functions in a context-dependent manner. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key players in the architecture of complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genetic associations with complex traits often involve intricate interactions between genes. To understand these interactions and develop new therapies, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations in trait-associated modules, highlighting the importance of considering these players in therapeutic interventions.
