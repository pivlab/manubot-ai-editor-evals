          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Gene expression patterns provide insights into the complex interplay
          between genes and their influence on complex traits. However,

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Sure, here is the revised abstract in a single paragraph following the
          C-C-C scheme:


          Gene expression patterns serve as a foundation for understanding how
          genes act in concert to influence complex traits. Despite advancements
          in transcriptome-wide association studies, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. To
          bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, our approach prioritizes
          functionally important players lacking associations but identified in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, offering insights into potential drug targets and
          pathways missed by single-gene strategies.

          Gene expression patterns orchestrate the intricate interplay of genes
          in specific contexts to fulfill their functions. To decipher how these
          genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across various conditions is paramount.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of complex trait architecture highlight the
          significance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This
          representation is anchored on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across similar conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          Genetic associations with complex traits are influenced by the
          coordinated activity of genes in specific contexts. To understand
          these associations, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across different conditions is crucial. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
          progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Furthermore, our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Our results
          demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic
          associations and identifying potential drug targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms':


          Gene expression patterns provide a powerful framework for
          understanding how genes act in concert to influence complex traits. To
          elucidate this complex relationship, a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions is essential.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
          etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data with gene expression patterns. We
          observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately
          predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          providing a novel framework for interpreting complex trait
          architecture and guiding therapeutic interventions.

          Gene expression patterns orchestrate complex traits through
          coordinated gene activity. To decipher these intricate mechanisms, a
          mechanistic understanding of how genes influence complex traits is
          essential. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related pathways. However,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease etiology. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation.
          This representation is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules and offers a new paradigm for drug
          target identification.

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Gene expression patterns provide a powerful tool for understanding how
          genes act in concert to influence complex traits. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          Genetic associations with complex traits are often influenced by
          complex interactions among genes. To understand these interactions, a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions is essential. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and
          progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules and offers insights into potential
          drug targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The complexity of complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse contexts.
          Although transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the
          involvement of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern
          models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and progression. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for a joint analysis. This representation is rooted in modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          offering insights into potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. Gene expression
          patterns reveal the concerted actions of genes in specific contexts.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is
          essential. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
          the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          The study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach
          utilizes the principle that genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. To elucidate the complex
          relationships between genes and traits, a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions is essential. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules and offers a new direction for drug
          repurposing.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          The complex nature of human diseases necessitates a deeper
          understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Gene expression
          patterns offer valuable insights into these mechanisms, but
          integrating this information with genetic associations remains a
          challenge. PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, bridges this gap by
          projecting genetic associations onto a common latent representation of
          gene expression patterns. This representation is based on modules of
          genes with similar expression profiles across various conditions. We
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and
          paving the way for more effective drug repurposing.

          The complex interplay of genetic factors and environmental influences
          shapes human traits and diseases. To uncover these intricate
          relationships, researchers have harnessed transcriptome-wide
          association studies, which have unveiled the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in complex trait
          architecture. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation.
          We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Gene expression patterns provide a powerful tool for understanding
          complex traits and disease mechanisms. PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach, leverages this information to project genetic
          associations onto a shared latent representation. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. The approach is based on the principle that genes act in
          concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
          a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms':


          The complex nature of disease etiology necessitates a comprehensive
          understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, addresses this gap
          by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation. The approach considers gene
          expression patterns across different conditions and groups genes into
          modules of co-expressed genes. Diseases are significantly associated
          with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          uncovering potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and
          advancing the field of drug repurposing.

          Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Gene expression
          patterns reveal intricate relationships between genes, with specific
          configurations influencing complex traits. To understand these
          intricate relationships, a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions is crucial. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using

          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          by single-gene strategies.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms':


          Genetic associations are essential for understanding complex diseases.
          However, determining how genes interact to influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, but modern models of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          offering a new perspective on drug target identification and
          repurposing.

          "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Gene expression patterns serve as a powerful tool for understanding
          the complex interplay between genes and their influence on complex
          traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel
          therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. We find that our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally important players that lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules and holds promise for guiding future drug discovery

          Gene expression patterns serve as a foundation for understanding
          complex traits through the interplay of genes in specific contexts.
          This study explores the association of genetic variations with gene
          expression patterns, highlighting the utility of this insight in drug
          discovery. The results demonstrate that diseases are intricately
          linked with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Importantly, the approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers drug mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that

          provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules and offers a new direction for drug
          repurposing and target identification.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          Gene expression patterns provide a powerful framework for
          understanding complex traits. In this study, we demonstrate that
          genetic associations with complex traits are often attributable to
          co-expressed gene modules rather than individual genes. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally important players that lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our findings
          highlight the importance of considering co-expressed genes when
          interpreting genetic associations and suggest that PhenoPLIER, a novel
          framework that incorporates gene modules, can identify potential
          therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene approaches.

          Genetic associations are influenced by the concerted action of genes

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          The intricate interplay of genes in specific contexts orchestrates
          their functions. To decipher how these genes influence complex traits,
          a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions is pivotal. Our study demonstrates that diseases are
          intimately associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. We show that our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated

          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract in a single paragraph following the
          C-C-C scheme:


          Gene expression patterns serve as a powerful tool for understanding
          complex traits. This study demonstrates that diseases are intricately
          associated with gene modules expressed in specific cell types. By
          integrating gene expression data with network analysis, we developed
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations
          through gene modules. We found that functionally important players
          lack associations with single genes but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Additionally, our results
          provide evidence that drug-disease pairs can be accurately predicted
          using this approach. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying
          potential drug targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic associations with complex traits often involve the coordinated
          activity of multiple genes, known as gene modules. To understand how
          these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions is required. Here,
          we show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. We find that our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Gene expression patterns orchestrate the intricate interplay of genes
          in specific contexts to carry out their functions. To decipher how
          these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across diverse conditions is paramount. This
          insight is instrumental for developing novel therapies. Our study
          demonstrates that diseases are intricately linked with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Further,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract in a single paragraph, following
          the C-C-C scheme:


          Genetic associations with complex traits are often complex and
          difficult to interpret. To understand these associations, it is
          important to identify the underlying gene expression patterns that
          drive them. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our novel framework,
          PhenoPLIER, can contextualize genetic associations by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes. PhenoPLIER provides a new approach for
          interpreting genetic associations and identifying potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          Genes orchestrate complex biological processes through coordinated
          expression patterns. To understand how these genes influence complex
          traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          diverse conditions is essential. Transcriptome-wide association

          data into a shared latent representation. This representation is based

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in regulating complex
          traits and disease progression. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the individual genes influencing complex
          traits, the complex interplay between genes remains elusive. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. We observe

          power of PhenoPLIER for understanding complex traits and guide drug
          repurposing efforts.

          The complex interplay of genes orchestrates their functions in
          specific contexts. To decipher how these genes influence complex
          traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          diverse conditions is imperative. It has been shown that this insight
          is instrumental for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the involvement of individual
          genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that harmonizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This
          representation is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Gene expression patterns orchestrate complex traits through
          coordinated gene activity. To understand how these genes influence
          complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions is crucial. Although transcriptome-wide
          association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions significantly influence disease origin and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. We find
          that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings provide a
          framework for exploring the complex interplay between genetic
          variation and environmental factors in disease and highlight the
          potential for drug repurposing and personalized medicine.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract:


          Gene expression patterns orchestrate complex traits through
          coordinated gene activity. To decipher these patterns and translate
          them into therapeutic interventions, a mechanistic understanding of
          how genes interact in specific contexts is paramount.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, but their impact on
          complex traits necessitates a deeper exploration of gene-gene
          interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This
          representation is anchored in modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across diverse conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract in a single paragraph following the
          C-C-C scheme:


          Gene expression patterns provide insights into the complex interplay
          between genes and their functions in specific contexts. Despite the
          advancements in transcriptome-wide association studies, a
          comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data with expression patterns across conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          our findings suggest that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a novel framework for exploring the
          genetic basis of complex traits and advancing drug repurposing
          efforts.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
          'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms':


          Gene expression patterns orchestrate complex biological functions
          through intricate interactions between genes. To elucidate these
          intricate mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions is pivotal. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in
          disease-related pathways. However, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions profoundly influence complex trait
          architecture. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This
          representation is anchored on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across specific conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers drug mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack direct associations but are prominently
          positioned within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract in a single paragraph:


          Gene expression patterns provide insights into the complex interplay
          between genes and their influence on complex traits. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, the intricate
          architecture of complex traits necessitates a deeper understanding of
          gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that effectively maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation.
          We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in complex trait modeling and drug repurposing.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript "Projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Genes act in coordinated networks to carry out specific functions in a
          context-dependent manner. To understand how these genes influence
          complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions is crucial. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are key players in the architecture of complex
          traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript "Projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Genetic associations with complex traits often involve intricate
          interactions between genes. To understand these interactions and
          develop new therapies, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across different conditions is crucial. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
          and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, our approach prioritizes functionally important
          players lacking associations in trait-associated modules, highlighting
          the importance of considering these players in therapeutic
          interventions.

            specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the
            specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g.

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              Gene expression patterns provide insights into the complex
              interplay between genes and their influence on complex traits.
              However, understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              Gene expression patterns serve as a foundation for understanding

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              Gene expression patterns orchestrate the intricate interplay of
              genes in specific contexts to fulfill their functions. To decipher
              how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across various conditions
              is paramount. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture
              highlight the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation. This representation is anchored on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across similar conditions.
              We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              Genetic associations with complex traits are influenced by the
              coordinated activity of genes in specific contexts. To understand
              these associations, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions is crucial.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role

              Gene expression patterns provide a powerful framework for
              understanding how genes act in concert to influence complex
              traits. To elucidate this complex relationship, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different conditions
              is essential. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed

              mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and

              perturbation data with gene expression patterns. We observed that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately
              predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of

              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
              "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


              Gene expression patterns provide a powerful tool for understanding
              how genes act in concert to influence complex traits. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              Genetic associations with complex traits are often influenced by
              complex interactions among genes. To understand these
              interactions, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions is essential.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in
              disease etiology and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation. This representation is based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
              find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules and offers insights into potential drug targets missed by
              single-gene strategies.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              The complexity of complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse
              contexts. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have
              unveiled the involvement of individual genes in disease-related

              expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

              we find that functionally important players lack associations but

              Genetic associations with complex traits are often complex and

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach is based
              on the principle that genes act in concert with each other in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              The study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              approach utilizes the principle that genes act in concert with
              each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. To
              elucidate the complex relationships between genes and traits, a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions is essential. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and offers a
              new direction for drug repurposing.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
              "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


              The complex nature of human diseases necessitates a deeper
              understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Gene
              expression patterns offer valuable insights into these mechanisms,
              but integrating this information with genetic associations remains
              a challenge. PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, bridges this
              gap by projecting genetic associations onto a common latent
              representation of gene expression patterns. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression profiles across
              various conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack direct associations
              but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
              highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies
              and paving the way for more effective drug repurposing.

              The complex interplay of genetic factors and environmental
              influences shapes human traits and diseases. To uncover these
              intricate relationships, researchers have harnessed
              transcriptome-wide association studies, which have unveiled the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in complex trait architecture. To bridge this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
              "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


              Gene expression patterns provide a powerful tool for understanding
              complex traits and disease mechanisms. PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach, leverages this information to project
              genetic associations onto a shared latent representation. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. The approach is based on the
              principle that genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. It has been shown that this
              insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
              'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms':


              The complex nature of disease etiology necessitates a
              comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach, addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation. The approach considers gene expression
              patterns across different conditions and groups genes into modules
              of co-expressed genes. Diseases are significantly associated with
              specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, uncovering potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies and advancing the field of drug repurposing.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known

              Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
              "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


              Gene expression patterns serve as a powerful tool for
              understanding the complex interplay between genes and their
              influence on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the
              development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. We find that our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and holds
              promise for guiding future drug discovery efforts.

              Gene expression patterns serve as a foundation for understanding
              complex traits through the interplay of genes in specific

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              The intricate interplay of genes in specific contexts orchestrates
              their functions. To decipher how these genes influence complex
              traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions is pivotal. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are intimately associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. We show that our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              Gene expression patterns serve as a powerful tool for
              understanding complex traits. This study demonstrates that
              diseases are intricately associated with gene modules expressed in
              specific cell types. By integrating gene expression data with
              network analysis, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel framework for
              contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules. We
              found that functionally important players lack associations with
              single genes but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Additionally, our results provide evidence that
              drug-disease pairs can be accurately predicted using this
              approach. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations and identifying potential drug
              targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies.

              Genetic associations with complex traits often involve the
              coordinated activity of multiple genes, known as gene modules. To
              understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different conditions
              is required. Here, we show that diseases are significantly

              Sure, here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled
              "Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


              Gene expression patterns orchestrate the intricate interplay of
              genes in specific contexts to carry out their functions. To
              decipher how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions
              is paramount. This insight is instrumental for developing novel
              therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are intricately
              linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Further, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Sure, here is the revised abstract in a single paragraph,
              following the C-C-C scheme:


              Genetic associations with complex traits are often complex and
              difficult to interpret. To understand these associations, it is
              important to identify the underlying gene expression patterns that
              drive them. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our novel
              framework, PhenoPLIER, can contextualize genetic associations by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. PhenoPLIER provides a
              new approach for interpreting genetic associations and identifying
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              Genes orchestrate complex biological processes through coordinated
              expression patterns. To understand how these genes influence
              complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across diverse conditions is essential.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the
              involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal to complex trait architecture. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation. This representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.
              We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in specific cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in regulating complex
              traits and disease progression. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the individual genes
              influencing complex traits, the complex interplay between genes
              remains elusive. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for a comprehensive analysis. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings highlight the power of PhenoPLIER for understanding
              complex traits and guide drug repurposing efforts.

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Sure, here is the revised abstract:


              Gene expression patterns orchestrate complex traits through
              coordinated gene activity. To decipher these patterns and
              translate them into therapeutic interventions, a mechanistic
              understanding of how genes interact in specific contexts is
              paramount. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light
              on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, but
              their impact on complex traits necessitates a deeper exploration
              of gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation. This representation is anchored in modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across diverse conditions.
              We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
              specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack direct associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Gene expression patterns provide insights into the complex
              interplay between genes and their functions in specific contexts.
              Despite the advancements in transcriptome-wide association
              studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data with expression
              patterns across conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              our findings suggest that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a novel framework for exploring

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Gene expression patterns orchestrate complex biological functions

              intricate mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions is pivotal.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of
              individual genes in disease-related pathways. However, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions profoundly influence
              complex trait architecture. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              Gene expression patterns provide insights into the complex
              interplay between genes and their influence on complex traits.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, the
              intricate architecture of complex traits necessitates a deeper
              understanding of gene-gene interactions. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that effectively maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation. We demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and that our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions in complex trait modeling and drug repurposing.

              genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


              Genes act in coordinated networks to carry out specific functions
              in a context-dependent manner. To understand how these genes
              influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions is crucial.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are key players in the architecture of complex
              traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across specific conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
