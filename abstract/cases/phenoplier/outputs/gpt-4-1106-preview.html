Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet playing functional roles are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Here we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules, predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, our method also highlights functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are implicated in trait-associated modules, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER advances our understanding of genetic contributions to disease by integrating co-expression networks, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. This approach offers a powerful framework for drug repurposing and the identification of novel drug mechanisms, with broad implications for functional genomics and the clustering of complex traits.">[PASS] (1.00) Understanding the interplay between genes in the context of complex traits is essential for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in identifying established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that genes lacking direct associations yet playing functional roles are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the contribution of gene-gene interactions to disease development remains less explored. Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene expression patterns to project genetic associations onto a common latent space, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data. Here we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules, predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers mechanisms of action.

We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.

PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression patterns under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are functionally significant.

In summary, PhenoPLIER transcends single-gene analysis by integrating co-expression networks, thereby enhancing the interpretation of genetic associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked.

We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating complex trait influences and advancing therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.

PhenoPLIER constructs its framework on the foundation of gene modules—clusters of genes exhibiting coordinated expression patterns under consistent conditions. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. The methodology demonstrates precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, even for genes that lack direct associations but are functionally significant.

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process pivotal to the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the interpretation of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new perspective for dissecting genetic associations by considering the collective behavior of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

Understanding the interplay of genes and their collective influence on complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic strategies, yet a comprehensive framework to elucidate this relationship remains elusive. This gap hinders our ability to identify novel drug targets and repurpose existing therapies.

Notably, our CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important genes that lack direct associations, highlighting its potential to uncover therapeutic targets that may otherwise be overlooked. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges the gap in functional genomics by providing a robust framework that contextualizes genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.

Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, a process pivotal to the innovation of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene clusters that are actively expressed in pertinent cellular environments. Moreover, our methodology exhibits proficiency in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based investigation into lipid metabolism, we discovered that certain genes of functional significance, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by our analytical tool, PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression networks to enhance the interpretation of genetic linkages, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. This innovative framework, PhenoPLIER, offers a new perspective for dissecting genetic associations by considering the collective behavior of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false
