A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits, a process pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent space is constructed upon modules of co-expressed genes under consistent conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, by employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we reveal that certain functionally critical genes, despite lacking direct associations, are identified within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages clusters of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This innovative framework offers a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene expression modules.">[PASS] (1.00) Genes operate in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. Genes collaborate within specific contexts to execute their biological roles, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating complex trait etiologies and advancing therapeutic development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are fundamental to the genesis and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER constructs its latent representation from clusters of genes exhibiting coherent expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly correlated with gene clusters expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER excels in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally critical genes that lack direct associations within trait-associated gene modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER leverages the collective information of co-expressed gene groups to contextualize genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework offers a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the prism of gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and informing drug repurposing efforts.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to fulfill their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of gene expression regulation under varying conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, a cornerstone in the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that disease pathogenesis is significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology exhibits precision in identifying established drug-disease relationships and deducing their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR-based lipid regulation analysis, we discovered that certain functionally critical genes, although not directly associated with traits, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our tool, PhenoPLIER. This underscores the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene analysis approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for the interpretation of genetic associations, leveraging the concept of gene co-expression modules to provide insights into disease etiology and inform drug discovery and repurposing efforts.</td>

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>
