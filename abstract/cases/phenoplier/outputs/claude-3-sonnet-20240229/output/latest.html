Complex traits and diseases often involve intricate interactions among multiple genes, making it challenging to unravel their underlying mechanisms solely through single-gene association studies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant processes, they fail to capture the gene-gene interactions that are crucial for understanding the architecture of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. 

Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions and co-expression patterns in dissecting the complex genetic architecture of traits and diseases. PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to integrate diverse data sources and capture these interactions offers a powerful approach for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and facilitating the development of more effective treatments.

Gene expression regulation plays a crucial role in determining complex traits, and understanding the mechanisms underlying this regulation is essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression. However, existing approaches fail to capture these interactions effectively. 

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking individual associations within trait-associated modules.

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, bridging the gap between gene expression regulation and complex trait manifestation. This approach advances our understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and paves the way for more effective therapeutic interventions.

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies.

Genes function in concert with one another in specific contexts to carry out their roles. Elucidating how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. It has been demonstrated that this insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of complex traits and diseases, but unraveling the intricate interplay between genes and their context-specific expression patterns remains a challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across conditions, enabling the contextualization of genetic associations and the revelation of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, bridging the gap between genetic associations and functional genomics.
