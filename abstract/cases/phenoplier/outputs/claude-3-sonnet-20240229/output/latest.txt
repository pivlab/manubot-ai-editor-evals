          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes orchestrate intricate interactions to perform their functions
          within specific contexts. Unraveling how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions. This insight has proven pivotal
          for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
          architecture of complex traits postulate that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          underpinned by modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of
          complex traits and diseases, yet a mechanistic understanding of how
          genes interact and regulate their expression in specific contexts
          remains elusive. This gap hinders the development of effective
          therapies, as modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fail to capture
          the intricate interplay between genes. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across conditions.

          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, bridging the gap between genetic studies and
          functional genomics to elucidate disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes orchestrate intricate interactions within specific contexts to
          execute their functions. Elucidating how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions. This insight has proven pivotal
          for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have unveiled the roles of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
          architecture of complex traits postulate that gene-gene interactions
          play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. Herein, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally crucial players
          lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          Complex traits and diseases often involve intricate interactions among
          multiple genes, making it challenging to unravel their underlying
          mechanisms solely through single-gene association studies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the
          roles of individual genes in disease-relevant processes, they fail to
          capture the gene-gene interactions that are crucial for understanding
          the architecture of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across
          various conditions. 


          Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


          Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
          interactions and co-expression patterns in dissecting the complex
          genetic architecture of traits and diseases. PhenoPLIER's ability to
          integrate diverse data sources and capture these interactions offers a
          powerful approach for uncovering novel therapeutic targets and
          repurposing existing drugs, ultimately advancing our understanding of
          complex traits and facilitating the development of more effective
          treatments.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Unraveling the complex interplay between genes and their expression
          patterns is crucial for understanding the etiology of diseases and
          developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          pivotal role in disease origin and progression. However, existing
          approaches fail to capture these intricate relationships, hindering
          our ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential therapeutic targets. (Context)


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression
          patterns across various conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. (Content)


          By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach
          advances the field of functional genomics by bridging the gap between
          genetic studies and the complex interplay of gene expression patterns,
          paving the way for more effective therapeutic interventions.

          Genetic studies have made significant progress in identifying
          individual genes associated with complex traits, but a comprehensive
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains elusive.
          The intricate interplay between genes, where they act in concert with
          each other in specific contexts, is crucial for unraveling the
          underlying mechanisms of complex traits. Traditional approaches often
          overlook the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin
          and progression, as predicted by modern models of complex trait
          architecture. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across various
          conditions. 


          Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach
          has broader implications for developing new therapies and advancing
          our knowledge of complex trait regulation.

          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their roles. Determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight has been shown to be
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
          mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However, current
          approaches often focus on individual genes, failing to capture the
          intricate gene-gene interactions that play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. This limitation hinders our ability to fully
          understand disease etiology and develop effective therapies. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules
          of co-expressed genes. Here, we demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, advancing our
          understanding of complex trait architecture and drug mechanisms.

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other
          in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these

          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Genetic studies have made significant strides in uncovering the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but a comprehensive
          understanding of complex traits requires accounting for gene-gene
          interactions and their context-specific expression patterns. Modern
          models predict that these interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression, a gap that existing approaches fail to address

          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lacking direct associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Determining the mechanisms by which genes influence complex traits and
          diseases is a critical challenge in modern biology. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression, which remains poorly understood. To address
          this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes.
          Here we show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Genetic studies have uncovered associations between individual genes
          and complex traits, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression.
          However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize these
          genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on modules of co-expressed genes. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          which is critical for developing new therapies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Determining the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases
          remains a significant challenge, as individual gene associations often
          fail to capture the intricate interplay among genes that collectively
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
          progression of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across
          various conditions. Here, we observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          which is critical for developing new therapies.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is

          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have made significant strides in uncovering the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
          progression of complex traits. Existing approaches fail to capture
          these intricate relationships, leaving a gap in our understanding of
          disease etiology and therapeutic target identification. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. By
          incorporating groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
          conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our method bridges the gap
          between genetic studies and functional genomics, providing a
          comprehensive view of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and paving
          the way for more effective therapeutic target identification and drug
          repurposing strategies.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The

          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, but the complex interplay
          between genes and their expression patterns remains largely
          unexplored. This gap in understanding gene-gene interactions and their
          functional implications hinders our ability to fully elucidate disease
          etiology and develop effective therapies. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. By
          incorporating groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
          various conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene
          co-expression patterns and functional genomics in elucidating disease
          mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets, paving the
          way for more effective drug development and repurposing strategies.

          Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. Existing approaches fail to capture
          these interactions, limiting our ability to develop new therapies.
          (Context)


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing PhenoPLIER to

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. (Content)


          By incorporating gene-gene interactions, PhenoPLIER provides a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions, filling a critical gap in our ability to determine how
          genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies. This
          advancement moves the broader field of complex trait analysis forward
          by enabling the discovery of potential therapeutic targets that were
          previously overlooked. (Conclusion)

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of
          complex traits and diseases, yet the underlying mechanisms remain
          elusive, hindering the development of effective therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. This gap in our knowledge of how genes act in concert to
          influence complex traits across different contexts limits our ability
          to develop targeted therapies. 


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes.
          By incorporating groups of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER's integration of gene
          co-expression patterns with genetic associations and pharmacological
          data provides a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions, bridging the gap between genetic studies
          and functional genomics. This approach has broader significance for
          uncovering the role of gene-gene interactions in complex traits,
          facilitating the development of new therapies targeting dysregulated
          gene modules.

          Gene expression regulation plays a crucial role in complex trait
          manifestation, and understanding gene-gene interactions is critical
          for elucidating disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene
          associations, they fail to capture the intricate interplay between

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have made significant strides in uncovering the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, a comprehensive
          understanding of complex traits requires accounting for gene-gene
          interactions, which play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. Existing approaches often overlook these interactions,
          limiting our ability to develop effective therapies. Here, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of co-expressed genes, enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions, bridging the gap between genetic associations
          and complex trait etiology, and facilitating the development of new
          therapies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. However, existing approaches fail to capture
          these interactions and their context-specific effects. 


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression

          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Our approach provides a mechanistic understanding of gene-gene
          interactions and their context-specific effects on complex traits,
          advancing the field of expression regulation and disease biology.

          Genetic studies have greatly advanced our understanding of complex
          traits and diseases, yet the underlying mechanisms often remain
          elusive due to the intricate interplay between genes and their
          regulatory networks. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          uncovered the roles of individual genes, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive approach.
          (Context)


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across various conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. (Content)


          Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          offering insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that are
          critical for developing new therapies. By bridging the gap between
          genetic associations and functional genomics, our approach advances
          the field of complex trait analysis and paves the way for more
          effective therapeutic strategies. (Conclusion)

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have made significant progress in identifying
          individual genes associated with complex traits, but our understanding
          of how genes interact to influence disease etiology and progression
          remains limited. Elucidating these gene-gene interactions is crucial
          for developing effective therapies and advancing our mechanistic
          understanding of complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association
          data, gene expression patterns, and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified framework. PhenoPLIER maps these diverse data sources
          into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
          genes, enabling the contextualization of genetic associations and the
          identification of potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking individual associations are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging gene
          co-expression patterns, our approach provides a powerful framework for
          elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and
          identifying novel therapeutic opportunities.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, but our understanding of how
          gene-gene interactions contribute to complex traits remains limited.
          This gap is significant because modern models predict that such
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes.
          By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our work highlights the importance of considering gene
          co-expression patterns in interpreting genetic associations, providing
          a framework for elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential
          drug targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. (Content) We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. (Conclusion) Our work highlights the importance of
          considering gene co-expression patterns in interpreting genetic
          associations, providing a powerful framework for elucidating disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. (Broader significance)

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role

          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease

          expression data and genetic associations, uncovering gene-gene
          interactions that play a crucial role in complex traits and disease
          mechanisms, thereby advancing our understanding of the architecture of
          complex traits and potentially informing therapeutic development.

          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions, bridging the gap between genetic studies and functional
          genomics. This approach highlights the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in complex trait architecture and offers a
          promising strategy for identifying novel therapeutic targets and
          repurposing existing drugs.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of
          complex traits and diseases, but unraveling the intricate interplay
          between genes and their context-specific expression patterns remains a
          challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered
          the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          of genetic associations and the revelation of potential targets missed

          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
          approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, bridging the gap between genetic
          associations and functional genomics.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Gene expression regulation plays a crucial role in determining complex
          traits, and a mechanistic understanding of this process across
          different conditions is essential for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin and
          progression, a gap that remains unexplored. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across

          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our approach provides a comprehensive understanding of
          gene-gene interactions in complex traits, bridging the gap between
          individual gene associations and disease mechanisms, and paving the
          way for developing targeted therapies.

              Genes orchestrate intricate interactions to perform their
              functions within specific contexts. Unraveling how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight
              has proven pivotal for developing novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
              roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is

              that functionally important players lacking associations are

              Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of
              complex traits and diseases, yet a mechanistic understanding of
              how genes interact and regulate their expression in specific
              contexts remains elusive. This gap hinders the development of
              effective therapies, as modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, they fail to capture the intricate interplay between
              genes. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, bridging the gap between genetic
              studies and functional genomics to elucidate disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms.

              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion

              Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight has
              proven pivotal for developing novel therapeutic interventions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the roles of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits
              postulate that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in
              disease etiology and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find
              that functionally crucial players lacking associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies.

              Complex traits and diseases often involve intricate interactions
              among multiple genes, making it challenging to unravel their
              underlying mechanisms solely through single-gene association
              studies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              provided insights into the roles of individual genes in
              disease-relevant processes, they fail to capture the gene-gene
              interactions that are crucial for understanding the architecture
              of complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns
              across various conditions. 


              Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


              Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions and co-expression patterns in dissecting the complex
              genetic architecture of traits and diseases. PhenoPLIER's ability
              to integrate diverse data sources and capture these interactions
              offers a powerful approach for uncovering novel therapeutic
              targets and repurposing existing drugs, ultimately advancing our
              understanding of complex traits and facilitating the development
              of more effective treatments.

              Gene expression regulation plays a crucial role in determining
              complex traits, and understanding the mechanisms underlying this
              regulation is essential for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin
              and progression. However, existing approaches fail to capture
              these interactions effectively.

              Unraveling the complex interplay between genes and their
              expression patterns is crucial for understanding the etiology of
              diseases and developing effective therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin
              and progression. However, existing approaches fail to capture
              these intricate relationships, hindering our ability to
              contextualize genetic associations and identify potential
              therapeutic targets. (Context)


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. (Content)


              By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This
              approach advances the field of functional genomics by bridging the
              gap between genetic studies and the complex interplay of gene
              expression patterns, paving the way for more effective therapeutic
              interventions. (Conclusion)

              Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform

              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

              Genetic studies have made significant progress in identifying
              individual genes associated with complex traits, but a
              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms remains elusive. The intricate interplay between genes,
              where they act in concert with each other in specific contexts, is
              crucial for unraveling the underlying mechanisms of complex
              traits. Traditional approaches often overlook the crucial role of
              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, as
              predicted by modern models of complex trait architecture. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. 


              Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach has broader
              implications for developing new therapies and advancing our
              knowledge of complex trait regulation.

              Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression, a gap in our
              current understanding. (Context)


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. (Content)


              By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive
              understanding of how gene-gene interactions influence complex
              traits and diseases. This approach moves the field forward by
              bridging the gap between genetic associations and mechanistic
              insights, paving the way for the development of new therapies.

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
              mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However,
              current approaches often focus on individual genes, failing to
              capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. This limitation hinders
              our ability to fully understand disease etiology and develop
              effective therapies. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Here, we
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals

              manifestation, and understanding the interplay between genes is
              essential for developing effective therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the roles of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. Here, we
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
              more comprehensive understanding of complex trait regulation and
              potential therapeutic targets.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By

            Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
            of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific
            contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
            influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
            expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown

              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene

              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              direct associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal

              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe
              that diseases significantly associate with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each
              other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining
              how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

              Determining the mechanisms by which genes influence complex traits
              and diseases is a critical challenge in modern biology. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression, which remains poorly understood. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes. Here we show that diseases are

              Genetic studies have uncovered associations between individual
              genes and complex traits, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to
              contextualize these genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies.

              Determining the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases

              Despite the success of transcriptome-wide association studies in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait

              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)

              Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

              a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Existing
              approaches fail to capture these interactions, limiting our
              ability to develop new therapies. (Context)


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing

              By incorporating gene-gene interactions, PhenoPLIER provides a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions, filling a critical gap in our ability to
              develop new therapies for complex traits. This approach moves the
              field forward by enabling the identification of potential
              therapeutic targets that would be missed by traditional
              single-gene strategies. (Conclusion)

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms, but the complex interplay
              between genes and their expression patterns remains largely
              unexplored. This gap in understanding gene-gene interactions and

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

              Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of
              complex traits and diseases, yet the underlying mechanisms remain
              elusive, hindering the development of effective therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. This gap in our knowledge of how genes act
              in concert to influence complex traits across different contexts
              limits our ability to develop targeted therapies. 


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes. By incorporating groups of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER's integration of gene
              co-expression patterns with genetic associations and
              pharmacological data provides a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, bridging the
              gap between genetic studies and functional genomics. This approach
              has broader significance for uncovering the role of gene-gene
              interactions in complex traits, facilitating the development of
              new therapies targeting dysregulated gene modules.

              Gene expression regulation plays a crucial role in complex trait
              manifestation, and understanding gene-gene interactions is
              critical for elucidating disease mechanisms and developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered individual gene associations, they fail to capture the
              intricate interplay between genes predicted by modern models of
              complex trait architecture. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions, as this insight is
              critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual

              Genetic studies have made significant strides in uncovering the
              role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, a

              Genetic studies have greatly advanced our understanding of complex
              traits and diseases, yet the underlying mechanisms often remain
              elusive due to the intricate interplay between genes and their
              regulatory networks. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the roles of individual genes, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression, highlighting the need for a more
              comprehensive approach. (Context)


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across various conditions. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. (Content)


              Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions, offering insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms that are critical for developing new therapies. By
              bridging the gap between genetic associations and functional
              genomics, our approach advances the field of complex trait
              analysis and paves the way for more effective therapeutic
              strategies. (Conclusion)

              Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Existing
              approaches fail to capture these interactions, hindering the
              development of new therapies. 


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into

              crucial for complex trait analysis and therapy development.
              PhenoPLIER advances the field by integrating diverse data sources
              to uncover novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

              Genetic studies have made significant progress in identifying
              individual genes associated with complex traits, but our
              understanding of how genes interact to influence disease etiology
              and progression remains limited. Elucidating these gene-gene
              interactions is crucial for developing effective therapies and
              advancing our mechanistic understanding of complex traits. Here,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              transcriptome-wide association data, gene expression patterns, and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework.
              PhenoPLIER maps these diverse data sources into a common latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes, enabling
              the contextualization of genetic associations and the
              identification of potential therapeutic targets that may be missed
              by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases

              Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform

              Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform
              their functions, and understanding how these gene-gene
              interactions influence complex traits is crucial for developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression, a gap that has
              not been adequately addressed. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns
              across conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              approach provides a novel way to integrate gene expression data
              and genetic associations, uncovering gene-gene interactions that
              play a crucial role in complex traits and disease mechanisms,
              thereby advancing our understanding of the architecture of complex
              traits and potentially informing therapeutic development.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genetic studies have made significant progress in identifying
              individual genes associated with complex traits, but understanding
              how these genes interact to influence disease etiology and
              progression remains a challenge. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have provided insights into the role of individual genes
              in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the architecture of
              complex traits. This gap in our understanding of how genes act in
              concert to perform their functions across different contexts
              hinders the development of new therapies. 


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly

              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and

              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking individual associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Our findings demonstrate that integrating gene co-expression
              patterns with genetic associations and pharmacological data can
              provide a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions, bridging the gap between genetic
              studies and functional genomics. This approach highlights the

              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes function in concert within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. Determining how these genes influence complex traits

              Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of
              complex traits and diseases, but unraveling the intricate
              interplay between genes and their context-specific expression
              patterns remains a challenge. While transcriptome-wide association

            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
            PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
            known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
            Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
            find that functionally important players lack associations but are
            prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
