          "output": "Genes function in concert with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. Understanding the influence of these genes on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of gene expression regulation under varying conditions, a critical insight for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that interactions among genes are fundamental to the origins and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This framework is constructed around modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that key functional players, although not directly associated, are highlighted in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER effectively contextualizes genetic associations, unveiling potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches."

          "output": "In the field of genetics, understanding the complex interplay between genes in various biological contexts is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying disease etiology and progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge by identifying the roles of individual genes, they fall short in capturing the gene-gene interactions that are increasingly recognized as pivotal in the architecture of complex traits. This gap hinders the development of effective therapies and the identification of precise therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations to construct a unified latent representation, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations. This method clusters genes into modules based on similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, enabling a more holistic view of gene interactions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs but also infers mechanisms of action, offering insights into drug repurposing opportunities. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules, underscoring potential targets that single-gene approaches might overlook. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool to contextualize genetic associations, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and expanding the scope for therapeutic intervention. This approach represents a significant step forward in functional genomics, offering new avenues for drug discovery and the refinement of therapeutic strategies."

Understanding how these interactions influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation under varying conditions, a critical factor in developing new therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in mechanisms relevant to diseases. Nonetheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This framework constructs modules based on genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER effectively predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional players, though not directly associated, are highlighted within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enhances the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches."

          "output": "Genes interact synergistically within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. Understanding how these interactions influence complex traits necessitates a deep mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation under varying conditions, which is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This model leverages modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER effectively predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that some crucial genes, although not directly associated, are highlighted in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of genetic associations and unveils potential therapeutic targets that might be overlooked by single-gene approaches."

          "output": "In the burgeoning field of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between genes in various biological contexts is crucial for elucidating complex trait etiologies and enhancing therapeutic development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in modeling the collective influence of gene-gene interactions on disease progression. This gap hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease origins and devise effective treatments. To address this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent space, facilitating comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER employs gene expression modules that capture co-expression patterns across different conditions, enhancing the precision of associating diseases with relevant cellular gene modules. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers mechanisms of drug action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that while some key players lack direct associations, they are effectively highlighted within trait-associated modules, suggesting that our approach can identify potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER significantly refines our understanding of genetic contributions to disease by contextualizing gene interactions within relevant biological frameworks, thereby proposing novel avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets. This advancement underscores the importance of considering gene networks in the study of complex diseases and paves the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies."

Understanding how these interactions influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation under varying conditions, a crucial aspect for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This latent representation is constructed from modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes, although not directly associated, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enhances the contextualization of genetic associations and identifies potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches."

          "output": "Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in various conditions is essential for advancing our knowledge of complex traits and developing new therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the critical influence of gene-gene interactions on disease etiology and progression remains underexplored. This gap hinders the comprehensive understanding needed for effective intervention. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This model utilizes modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions, enabling a more holistic analysis. Our findings demonstrate that disease traits significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identified key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules, suggesting their functional importance. By leveraging the power of gene co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic associations but also identifies potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by conventional single-gene approaches. This methodology enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and opens new avenues for targeted drug discovery."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene contributions to disease, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions essential for comprehending disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This method employs modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of gene networks. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also effectively infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, by applying PhenoPLIER in conjunction with a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are crucial within trait-associated modules. This approach significantly enhances our ability to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by conventional single-gene methods, thereby advancing the field of genomic medicine by enabling a more nuanced understanding of complex trait architectures."

This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of how these genes collectively influence disease phenotypes and drug responses. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Notably, diseases show significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that while some functionally important genes lacked direct associations, they were effectively prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results underscore the utility of our approach in capturing essential genetic players overlooked by single-gene analyses.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the roles of individual genes, they often overlook the significance of gene-gene interactions, which are essential for comprehending disease mechanisms and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data, mapping them into a unified latent representation. This representation is constructed from modules of co-expressed genes, which reveal critical insights into gene function across various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates potential mechanisms of action, with diseases significantly correlating with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlighted that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating these co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic associations but also identifies potential therapeutic targets that are not apparent through single-gene analysis approaches. Thus, PhenoPLIER substantially enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, potentially accelerating the development of targeted therapies."

This latent representation is derived from clusters of genes exhibiting similar expression profiles under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that specific diseases are robustly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that certain critical genes, although not directly associated, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, underscoring their potential importance. By leveraging the collective behavior of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a refined perspective on genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes operate synergistically within specific biological contexts to exert their effects. A deeper understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits through their interactions is essential for mechanistic insights, which are pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that interactions among multiple genes are critical to the etiology and progression of complex diseases."

Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action, with diseases significantly correlating with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed that while some functionally crucial players lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated modules, underscoring the potential of our approach to identify important therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene strategies. By providing a deeper understanding of gene co-expression in disease contexts, PhenoPLIER not only bridges a critical knowledge gap but also paves the way for novel drug repurposing opportunities and the development of precision medicine."

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, yet the understanding of gene-gene interactions remains limited, particularly in how these interactions contribute to disease etiology and progression. This gap hinders the development of targeted therapies and the repurposing of existing drugs. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping both gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of how genes operate in concert across various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that disease traits are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules, suggesting potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches. These results not only confirm the importance of considering gene co-expression in understanding disease mechanisms but also advance our ability to identify novel therapeutic targets and enhance drug repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries of precision medicine and functional genomics."

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of how individual genes contribute to disease mechanisms. Despite this progress, a comprehensive model accounting for gene-gene interactions and their implications in complex trait architectures remains elusive, hindering the development of effective therapies. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression and pharmacological data to construct a latent representation facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations. This method utilizes modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under comparable conditions, enabling a more nuanced exploration of genetic interactions. Our findings reveal that disease traits significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates drugs' mechanisms of action but also identifies crucial yet overlooked therapeutic targets through CRISPR screening for lipid regulation. By prioritizing trait-associated modules, our approach highlights important players that traditional single-gene strategies typically miss. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of the genetic foundations of diseases and informs the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby facilitating drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits. This advancement is pivotal for refining drug discovery processes and accelerating the translation of genetic insights into clinical applications."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the roles of individual genes, they often overlook critical gene-gene interactions that contribute to disease etiology and progression.

This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating the analysis of their collective behavior across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs but also identifies potential therapeutic targets that are not apparent when analyzing single genes. For instance, in a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER successfully highlighted important yet previously unassociated genes within trait-relevant modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of the molecular basis of complex traits by contextualizing genetic interactions, thereby paving the way for novel therapeutic discoveries and advancing the broader field of genomic medicine."

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the intricate relationships between gene expression and complex traits is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies. Despite progress in transcriptome-wide association studies which elucidate the roles of individual genes, current models suggest that interactions among multiple genes significantly influence disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing approaches often overlook these interactions, limiting our understanding of disease mechanisms and hindering the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of how these genes collectively influence complex traits under various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers the underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully highlights important genes that lack direct associations yet play crucial roles in disease contexts, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By providing a more holistic view of gene interactions, PhenoPLIER enhances our mechanistic understanding of disease processes and opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the development of targeted therapies. This advancement significantly propels the field of functional genomics forward, offering promising insights into the clustering of complex traits and the identification of novel therapeutic targets."

          "output": "Understanding the intricate relationships between gene interactions and complex traits is pivotal for advancing our mechanistic insights into disease etiology and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the critical influence of gene-gene interactions within cellular networks. This gap hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease origins and progression, and subsequently, to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes, enabling the contextualization of genetic associations across various conditions and highlighting potential therapeutic targets that are typically missed by single-gene analyses. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct associations but are crucial within trait-associated modules. These results not only confirm the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms and drug actions but also suggest its broader application in drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This advancement significantly enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and opens new avenues for targeted therapy development."

Transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, yet contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. Our findings demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairings and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional players, although not directly associated, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational strategy that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework leverages modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions, enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches."

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the regulation of gene expression across different conditions is pivotal for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and developing new therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are crucial for comprehending disease etiology and progression. This gap highlights the need for models that can integrate these interactions to better predict disease associations and therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data, grounded in the co-expression of gene modules across various conditions. This method not only predicts known drug-disease pairs with high accuracy but also uncovers mechanisms of action and identifies potential therapeutic targets that are not evident through single-gene analysis. For instance, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritized functionally significant genes that lacked direct associations but were central in trait-associated modules. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively bridges the gap in current genetic studies by providing a comprehensive view of gene interactions and their implications in disease and therapy. This advancement not only deepens our understanding of disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby moving the field of functional genomics forward."

          "output": "Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. Understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits. Such insights are pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that interactions among genes are fundamental to the onset and progression of diseases. Our findings demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we identified crucial genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This space is constructed from clusters of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. By leveraging these co-expression groups, PhenoPLIER enhances the interpretation of genetic data, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, they fall short in elucidating the collective behavior of genes expressed in concert under specific conditions, which is essential for grasping the full spectrum of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data. This model is based on clusters of co-expressed genes, enabling us to capture the nuanced dynamics of gene networks across different biological states. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers critical mechanistic insights by identifying key gene modules active in relevant cell types. For instance, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that several significant regulators, previously overlooked, are highlighted within trait-associated modules. These results indicate that PhenoPLIER effectively fills the gap in current genetic studies by providing a more holistic view of gene interactions, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease origins and informing the development of targeted therapies. This approach promises to refine the identification of therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing, potentially accelerating the translation of genetic insights into clinical applications."

A deep mechanistic insight into how these genes regulate expression across varying conditions is essential for understanding complex traits and developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in mechanisms relevant to disease, yet contemporary models suggest that interactions between genes are critical to the genesis and progression of diseases. We have found significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our methodology effectively predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes, although not directly associated, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational strategy that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework leverages modules of co-expressed genes under identical conditions, enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches."

          "output": "In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between gene expression and complex traits is crucial for elucidating disease mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge by identifying the roles of individual genes, they often overlook the significant impact of gene-gene interactions on disease etiology and progression. This gap hinders the development of effective therapies, as a comprehensive model integrating these interactions remains elusive. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to map gene-trait associations together with pharmacological perturbation data. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes, identified across various conditions, to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that are not evident through single-gene analysis. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action, offering insights into disease etiology. Additionally, in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER successfully prioritized functionally important genes that lacked direct associations, highlighting its utility in identifying relevant molecular players. By providing a more integrated view of gene interactions and their implications in disease, PhenoPLIER not only fills a critical gap in our understanding of genetic underpinnings but also paves the way for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics."

          "output": "Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to execute their biological roles. Understanding the mechanisms by which these genes regulate expression across varying conditions is essential for dissecting complex traits and developing novel therapeutic strategies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in mechanisms pertinent to disease, contemporary models suggest that interactions among genes are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. Our findings demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Importantly, our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional genes, though not directly associated, are highlighted within trait-associated modules by our novel computational tool, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis, leveraging co-expressed gene modules to provide a contextual understanding of genetic influences. This approach not only enhances the identification of potential therapeutic targets but also overcomes the limitations of single-gene analysis strategies."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the intricate gene-gene interactions that are crucial for comprehending disease etiology and progression. This gap hinders the development of effective therapies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data, based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions.

These findings underscore the utility of our method in revealing biologically relevant gene modules and potential therapeutic targets that are otherwise overlooked. By providing a more nuanced understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications for disease and therapy, PhenoPLIER sets the stage for advancements in drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, thus offering significant contributions to the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine."

          "output": "Genes work together in specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a detailed mechanistic insight into the regulation of gene expression under varying conditionsâ€”a critical factor in developing new therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that interactions between genes are vital to the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This model leverages modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. By including clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of genetic associations and identifies potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. We demonstrate that disease associations are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER proves effective in predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that key functional players, although not directly associated, are highlighted in trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its utility in identifying critical components in complex traits."

          "output": "Understanding the interplay of genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains a pivotal challenge in functional genomics. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes, the complex architecture of diseases suggests that interactions among multiple genes are crucial for understanding disease progression and identifying therapeutic targets. Current models, however, often overlook these gene-gene interactions, limiting their ability to fully explain disease mechanisms and hindering the development of effective therapies. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations to construct a unified latent representation. This model identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene-trait associations and the discovery of potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might miss. Our results demonstrate that disease traits significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and offers insights into their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted critical genes that, while not directly associated with traits, are essential within trait-associated modules, as identified by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only bridge gaps in understanding the genetic foundations of complex diseases but also advance the identification of novel drug targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, thereby enhancing the precision and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions."

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

          "output": "Genes interact within complex networks to regulate traits across various biological contexts, a crucial understanding for advancing therapeutic strategies. Despite the insights offered by transcriptome-wide association studies into individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in comprehensively understanding gene-gene interactions and their implications in disease development and progression. To address this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation, facilitating the analysis of co-expressed gene modules under similar conditions. Our approach not only contextualizes genetic associations but also uncovers potential therapeutic targets overlooked by conventional single-gene analyses. We demonstrate that disease traits significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen exploring lipid regulation highlighted that key regulatory genes, although not directly associated, are effectively prioritized within trait-related modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the utility of our method in revealing intricate gene networks and their roles in disease, thereby providing a robust platform for identifying novel therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of complex trait architectures."

Understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and developing novel therapeutic interventions.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. By including clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enhances the contextualization of genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our findings demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types.

Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify crucial yet previously unassociated genes that PhenoPLIER prioritizes within trait-related modules, emphasizing its utility in identifying key molecular players."

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "In the field of genetic research, understanding the intricate relationships between genes and their collective impact on complex traits is paramount for advancing therapeutic interventions. Despite progress in identifying individual gene contributions through transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains insufficiently explored. This gap hinders the development of comprehensive models that can predict disease progression and response to treatments. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages gene co-expression data and pharmacological perturbations to construct a unified latent space where gene-trait associations are systematically analyzed. By mapping these associations alongside drug action mechanisms, PhenoPLIER identifies clusters of co-expressed genes that elucidate the molecular underpinnings of diseases and potential therapeutic targets previously overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our results demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of predicting known drug-disease relationships and deciphering drug mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation validated that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes key regulatory genes that traditional methods do not highlight. Consequently, this study not only bridges a critical knowledge gap by integrating gene interaction networks into disease trait analysis but also sets the stage for refined drug repurposing strategies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine."

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the realm of genetics, understanding the intricate interplay between genes in various contexts is essential for elucidating their roles in complex traits and diseases, a critical step toward developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge by identifying individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, they often overlook the broader gene-gene interactions essential for comprehending disease etiology and progression. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data for comprehensive analysis. This method utilizes modules of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, enhancing the identification of potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene analyses. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action, with significant associations observed between disease-relevant gene modules and specific cell types. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that while some functionally crucial genes lacked direct associations, they were effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules. Thus, PhenoPLIER not only fills a crucial research void by capturing complex gene interactions but also propels the field forward by offering a more nuanced understanding of gene networks in disease contexts, potentially guiding future therapeutic innovations."

Understanding how these genes modulate complex traits necessitates a thorough grasp of gene expression regulation under varying conditions, a critical element in the development of new therapeutic interventions.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework utilizes gene modules characterized by similar expression profiles across identical conditions. PhenoPLIER enhances the interpretation of genetic associations by leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our findings demonstrate that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that key functional entities, although not directly associated, are effectively prioritized within trait-related modules by PhenoPLIER, underscoring its utility in identifying novel targets."

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          "output": "In the field of genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genes in the context of disease progression and treatment is pivotal. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the critical influence of gene-gene interactions. This gap hinders the development of comprehensive models that can predict disease origin and progression based on these interactions. To address this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes, enabling the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential therapeutic targets that are not evident when considering genes in isolation. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also elucidates mechanisms of action by aligning disease-associated gene modules with relevant cell types. Additionally, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, identifying key regulatory genes that lack direct associations. Thus, PhenoPLIER significantly enhances our ability to decipher complex genetic interactions, offering profound implications for the development of targeted therapies and the understanding of disease mechanisms."

The importance of such insights for novel therapeutic development has been underscored by transcriptome-wide association studies, which have shed light on the contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms.

This framework constructs modules based on genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. By leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enhances the contextualization of genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our findings demonstrate significant correlations between disease states and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER also accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that key functional genes, though not directly associated, are prioritized within trait-linked modules by PhenoPLIER, emphasizing its utility in identifying critical biological players."

Despite progress through transcriptome-wide association studies in identifying the roles of individual genes, there remains a critical gap in comprehensively understanding gene-gene interactions and their implications for disease mechanisms. Addressing this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent representation. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes to enhance the contextualization of genetic influences, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that are not evident through single-gene analysis. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively identifies disease-associated gene modules and accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships, offering insights into their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen application on lipid regulation highlighted that some key regulatory genes, though not directly associated with traits, are prioritized within relevant gene modules, underscoring the utility of our approach in identifying critical but overlooked biological players. Thus, PhenoPLIER not only fills a significant research void by mapping complex gene interactions more comprehensively but also sets the stage for refined genetic interventions in disease treatment and prevention."

Understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

Our findings demonstrate that disease-related gene modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of predicting known drug-disease relationships and deciphering drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, our application of PhenoPLIER in a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation highlights its ability to identify key regulatory genes that traditional single-gene approaches might miss. The implications of this study are profound, offering a new avenue for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait clustering and their treatment strategies."

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current understanding of gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease progression remains incomplete. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes to enhance the contextual analysis of genetic interactions, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. Our findings demonstrate that certain diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only fills a critical gap by mapping complex gene interactions relevant to diseases but also advances our ability to identify novel therapeutic targets, thereby propelling the field of genetic research and personalized medicine forward."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge by identifying the roles of individual genes, they fall short in capturing the gene-gene interactions that are increasingly recognized as pivotal in the architecture of complex traits. This gap hinders the development of effective therapies and the identification of precise therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations to construct a unified latent representation, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations. This method clusters genes into modules based on similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, enabling a more holistic view of gene interactions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs but also infers mechanisms of action, offering insights into drug repurposing opportunities. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules, underscoring potential targets that single-gene approaches might overlook. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool to contextualize genetic associations, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and expanding the scope for therapeutic intervention. This approach represents a significant step forward in functional genomics, offering new avenues for drug discovery and the refinement of therapeutic strategies.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene functions in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the critical interactions between genes that can influence disease onset and progression. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective therapies that could target these interactions. To address this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This model identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enhancing our understanding of gene network dynamics in disease contexts. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers previously unrecognized mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic targets, particularly through the analysis of gene modules expressed in disease-relevant cell types. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes important yet previously unassociated genes within trait-related modules. By revealing critical gene-gene interactions and contextualizing genetic associations within functional modules, PhenoPLIER significantly advances our ability to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention, pushing the boundaries of current genomic research on complex traits and diseases.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes, they often overlook the critical gene-gene interactions that underpin complex traits and their progression. This gap in knowledge hinders the development of effective therapies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data within a unified latent space, facilitating the analysis of co-expressed gene modules across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers the mechanisms underlying these associations. Specifically, we identify gene modules expressed in cell types relevant to specific diseases, and through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we highlight functionally significant genes that previous single-gene approaches have missed. By leveraging the power of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER offers a robust framework for redefining genetic associations and enhancing drug repurposing strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex disease mechanisms and opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

              "text": "In the field of genomics, understanding the complex interactions among genes is essential for unraveling the mechanisms underlying trait expression and disease progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in these processes, they fall short in addressing the collective influence of gene-gene interactions. This gap hinders the development of comprehensive models that accurately reflect the architecture of complex traits and their progression into diseases. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data, integrating them into a unified latent representation. This method employs modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating the analysis of their expression across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that disease states are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that key functional genes, previously unassociated with traits, are prioritized within these modules. This indicates that PhenoPLIER effectively identifies potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches. Consequently, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a more holistic view of gene interactions and their implications in disease, thereby enhancing the potential for novel therapeutic discoveries.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "In the burgeoning field of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between genes in various biological contexts is crucial for elucidating complex trait etiologies and enhancing therapeutic development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, there remains a significant gap in modeling the collective influence of gene-gene interactions on disease progression. This gap hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease origins and devise effective treatments. To address this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent space, facilitating comprehensive analysis. PhenoPLIER employs gene expression modules that capture co-expression patterns across different conditions, enhancing the precision of associating diseases with relevant cellular gene modules. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers mechanisms of drug action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that while some key players lack direct associations, they are effectively highlighted within trait-associated modules, suggesting that our approach can identify potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER significantly refines our understanding of genetic contributions to disease by contextualizing gene interactions within relevant biological frameworks, thereby proposing novel avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets. This advancement underscores the importance of considering gene networks in the study of complex diseases and paves the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the crucial interactions between genes that shape disease etiology and progression. This gap in understanding gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease and therapeutic interventions remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression data and pharmacological perturbations to construct a unified latent representation, facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations. This method clusters genes into modules based on similar expression patterns across diverse conditions, allowing for the identification of disease-relevant cellular gene modules. Our findings demonstrate that these gene modules are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and infers drugs' mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes important yet previously unassociated genes within trait-related modules. Consequently, PhenoPLIER not only fills the critical gap in understanding the complex interplay of gene networks in disease but also highlights potential therapeutic targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, thereby advancing the fields of functional genomics and personalized medicine.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge by identifying roles of individual genes, they often overlook the intricate gene-gene interactions that are crucial for unraveling disease etiology and progression. This gap hinders the development of effective therapies, as a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation under diverse conditions is essential. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to map gene-trait associations alongside pharmacological perturbation data for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes, identified across various conditions, to enhance the understanding of genetic interactions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The approach not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs but also infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By integrating these groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER successfully contextualizes genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies might miss. This method not only fills a critical gap in functional genomics but also paves the way for innovative drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, significantly advancing our ability to combat complex diseases.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene contributions to disease, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions essential for comprehending disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This method employs modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of gene networks. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also effectively infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, by applying PhenoPLIER in conjunction with a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified key regulatory genes that, despite lacking direct associations, are crucial within trait-associated modules. This approach significantly enhances our ability to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by conventional single-gene methods, thereby advancing the field of genomic medicine by enabling a more nuanced understanding of complex trait architectures.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of individual gene roles in disease, they often overlook the broader gene-gene interactions that are crucial for comprehending complex trait architectures and their progression. Addressing this gap, our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of how these genes collectively influence disease phenotypes and drug responses. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Notably, diseases show significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation revealed that while some functionally important genes lacked direct associations, they were effectively prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results underscore the utility of our approach in capturing essential genetic players overlooked by single-gene analyses. By providing a deeper understanding of gene networks, PhenoPLIER not only sheds light on disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine.",

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the broader gene-gene interactions essential for comprehending disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to construct a unified latent representation. This model is based on modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns across various conditions. Our findings reveal significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, thereby enhancing our understanding of complex trait architectures. Additionally, our use of CRISPR screening in lipid regulation highlights the ability of PhenoPLIER to prioritize key genetic players that lack direct associations but are crucial in trait-associated modules. This approach not only fills the gap in capturing gene-gene interactions but also provides a robust framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene analysis, thus propelling forward the field of genomic medicine.",

This framework utilizes gene modules, which are groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that these gene modules, when expressed in pertinent cell types, show significant associations with diseases. PhenoPLIER proves effective in accurately predicting established drug-disease relationships and elucidating drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen designed to investigate lipid regulation, we identify key functional entities that, despite lacking direct associations, are highlighted within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a nuanced understanding of genetic links and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes function collectively within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. Understanding the mechanistic regulation of gene expression across varying conditions is essential for dissecting how genes influence complex traits and is pivotal in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that interactions among multiple genes are fundamental to the genesis and progression of complex diseases.",

Despite this progress, a comprehensive model accounting for gene-gene interactions and their implications in complex trait architectures remains elusive, hindering the development of effective therapies. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression and pharmacological data to construct a latent representation facilitating the joint analysis of gene-trait associations. This method utilizes modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under comparable conditions, enabling a more nuanced exploration of genetic interactions. Our findings reveal that disease traits significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates drugs' mechanisms of action but also identifies crucial yet overlooked therapeutic targets through CRISPR screening for lipid regulation. By prioritizing trait-associated modules, our approach highlights important players that traditional single-gene strategies typically miss. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER enhances our understanding of the genetic foundations of diseases and informs the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby facilitating drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits. This advancement is pivotal for refining drug discovery processes and accelerating the translation of genetic insights into clinical applications.",

Despite progress in transcriptome-wide association studies which elucidate the roles of individual genes, current models suggest that interactions among multiple genes significantly influence disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing approaches often overlook these interactions, limiting our understanding of disease mechanisms and hindering the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of how these genes collectively influence complex traits under various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers the underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach successfully highlights important genes that lack direct associations yet play crucial roles in disease contexts, as evidenced by a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By providing a more holistic view of gene interactions, PhenoPLIER enhances our mechanistic understanding of disease processes and opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the development of targeted therapies. This advancement significantly propels the field of functional genomics forward, offering promising insights into the clustering of complex traits and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes, they often overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions, which are vital for comprehending disease mechanisms and progression. PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach introduced here, addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes, identified under similar conditions, to enhance the mechanistic understanding of gene regulation in disease contexts. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by associating diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that while some functionally important genes lacked direct associations, they were effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules. By integrating these groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic associations but also identifies potential therapeutic targets that are missed by single-gene approaches. Consequently, this research advances our ability to predict and manipulate the complex interplay of genes in disease, potentially accelerating the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the critical influence of gene-gene interactions within cellular networks. This gap hinders our ability to fully comprehend disease origins and progression, and subsequently, to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that bridges this gap by integrating gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes, enabling the contextualization of genetic associations across various conditions and highlighting potential therapeutic targets that are typically missed by single-gene analyses. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct associations but are crucial within trait-associated modules. These results not only confirm the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms and drug actions but also suggest its broader application in drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This advancement significantly enhances our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and opens new avenues for targeted therapy development.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our understanding of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that are crucial for comprehending disease etiology and progression. This gap highlights the need for models that can integrate these interactions to better predict disease associations and therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data, grounded in the co-expression of gene modules across various conditions. This method not only predicts known drug-disease pairs with high accuracy but also uncovers mechanisms of action and identifies potential therapeutic targets that are not evident through single-gene analysis. For instance, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritized functionally significant genes that lacked direct associations but were central in trait-associated modules. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively bridges the gap in current genetic studies by providing a comprehensive view of gene interactions and their implications in disease and therapy. This advancement not only deepens our understanding of disease etiology but also opens new avenues for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby moving the field of functional genomics forward.",

Understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits. Such insights are pivotal for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

Our findings demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our method accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes, they fall short in elucidating the collective behavior of genes expressed in concert under specific conditions, which is essential for grasping the full spectrum of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data. This model is based on clusters of co-expressed genes, enabling us to capture the nuanced dynamics of gene networks across different biological states. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also uncovers critical mechanistic insights by identifying key gene modules active in relevant cell types. For instance, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that several significant regulators, previously overlooked, are highlighted within trait-associated modules. These results indicate that PhenoPLIER effectively fills the gap in current genetic studies by providing a more holistic view of gene interactions, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease origins and informing the development of targeted therapies. This approach promises to refine the identification of therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing, potentially accelerating the translation of genetic insights into clinical applications.",

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "text": "In the field of genomics, understanding the roles of genes in complex traits and diseases necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation under varying conditions. Current methodologies, including transcriptome-wide association studies, have advanced our knowledge by identifying individual gene functions in disease mechanisms. However, these approaches often overlook the critical interactions between genes, which are essential for unraveling the complexities of disease origins and progression. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. This model is built upon modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating the analysis of gene-gene interactions across various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs but also identifies potential therapeutic targets that are not apparent through single-gene analysis methods. By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we further validate that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes functionally significant genes that lack direct associations yet are crucial within trait-associated modules. The introduction of PhenoPLIER thus marks a significant advance in the field, offering a more holistic view of gene interactions in disease mechanisms and enhancing the potential for novel therapeutic discoveries.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge by identifying the roles of individual genes, they often overlook the significant impact of gene-gene interactions on disease etiology and progression. This gap hinders the development of effective therapies, as a comprehensive model integrating these interactions remains elusive. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to map gene-trait associations together with pharmacological perturbation data. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes, identified across various conditions, to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that are not evident through single-gene analysis. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action, offering insights into disease etiology. Additionally, in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER successfully prioritized functionally important genes that lacked direct associations, highlighting its utility in identifying relevant molecular players. By providing a more integrated view of gene interactions and their implications in disease, PhenoPLIER not only fills a critical gap in our understanding of genetic underpinnings but also paves the way for drug repurposing and the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the intricate gene-gene interactions that are crucial for comprehending disease etiology and progression. This gap hinders the development of effective therapies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation of gene-trait associations and pharmacological data, based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action but also, through the use of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, identifies important genetic players that traditional single-gene approaches fail to recognize. These findings underscore the utility of our method in revealing biologically relevant gene modules and potential therapeutic targets that are otherwise overlooked. By providing a more nuanced understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications for disease and therapy, PhenoPLIER sets the stage for advancements in drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits, thus offering significant contributions to the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the architecture of complex traits suggests a significant impact of gene-gene interactions on disease emergence and progression, a dimension not fully explored in current models. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations across different conditions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of diseases. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action, even identifying key regulatory players that traditional single-gene approaches overlook. By employing PhenoPLIER, we not only enhance our mechanistic comprehension of complex traits but also improve the identification of potential therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of genomics and personalized medicine.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Understanding the interplay of genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains a pivotal challenge in functional genomics. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes, the complex architecture of diseases suggests that interactions among multiple genes are crucial for understanding disease progression and identifying therapeutic targets. Current models, however, often overlook these gene-gene interactions, limiting their ability to fully explain disease mechanisms and hindering the development of effective therapies. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene expression data and pharmacological perturbations to construct a unified latent representation. This model identifies modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling a comprehensive analysis of gene-trait associations and the discovery of potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might miss. Our results demonstrate that disease traits significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and offers insights into their mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted critical genes that, while not directly associated with traits, are essential within trait-associated modules, as identified by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only bridge gaps in understanding the genetic foundations of complex diseases but also advance the identification of novel drug targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, thereby enhancing the precision and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions.",

Despite progress in identifying individual gene contributions through transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains insufficiently explored. This gap hinders the development of comprehensive models that can predict disease progression and response to treatments. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages gene co-expression data and pharmacological perturbations to construct a unified latent space where gene-trait associations are systematically analyzed. By mapping these associations alongside drug action mechanisms, PhenoPLIER identifies clusters of co-expressed genes that elucidate the molecular underpinnings of diseases and potential therapeutic targets previously overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our results demonstrate that disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types, enhancing the accuracy of predicting known drug-disease relationships and deciphering drug mechanisms. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation validated that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes key regulatory genes that traditional methods do not highlight. Consequently, this study not only bridges a critical knowledge gap by integrating gene interaction networks into disease trait analysis but also sets the stage for refined drug repurposing strategies and the identification of novel therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine.",

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework utilizes gene modules characterized by similar expression profiles across identical conditions. PhenoPLIER enhances the interpretation of genetic associations by leveraging clusters of co-expressed genes, thereby identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our findings demonstrate that diseases significantly correlate with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and deciphers drug mechanisms of action.

Traditional genetic studies have focused on the effects of individual genes, often overlooking the broader gene-gene interactions that underpin disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. This gap limits our ability to fully elucidate the etiology of complex diseases and hampers the identification of effective therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a latent representation to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data. This method clusters genes into modules based on co-expression patterns across various conditions, enabling a more holistic view of genetic interactions. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively identifies modules of genes expressed in disease-relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships, and infers drugs' mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, PhenoPLIER prioritizes key genes that traditional single-gene approaches do not detect. These findings not only advance our understanding of disease mechanisms but also open new avenues for drug repurposing and the discovery of therapeutic targets, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of functional genomics and personalized medicine.",

              "text": "In the field of genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genes in the context of disease progression and treatment is pivotal. While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they often overlook the critical influence of gene-gene interactions. This gap hinders the development of comprehensive models that can predict disease origin and progression based on these interactions. To address this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes, enabling the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential therapeutic targets that are not evident when considering genes in isolation. Our findings demonstrate that PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also elucidates mechanisms of action by aligning disease-associated gene modules with relevant cell types. Additionally, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes trait-associated modules, identifying key regulatory genes that lack direct associations. Thus, PhenoPLIER significantly enhances our ability to decipher complex genetic interactions, offering profound implications for the development of targeted therapies and the understanding of disease mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies that elucidate the roles of individual genes, the significance of gene-gene interactions in shaping disease progression and therapeutic response is not fully captured by current models. This limitation underscores the need for novel methodologies that can integrate these interactions to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages a common latent representation to map gene-trait associations alongside pharmacological perturbation data. This method utilizes modules of co-expressed genes, allowing for the contextual analysis of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets that are overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our findings demonstrate that disease traits are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, our CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation reveals that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results not only address the critical gap in understanding gene-gene interactions but also advance the field by providing a robust tool for drug repurposing and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby enhancing the precision of genetic studies in disease intervention and treatment strategies.",

Understanding the regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes, exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions, to provide context to genetic associations and identify potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. We demonstrate that disease associations are significantly correlated with gene modules active in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation revealed that while some functionally crucial genes do not show direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, underscoring the utility of our approach in identifying key molecular players in complex traits.",

This gap hinders the full elucidation of disease origins and progression, as well as the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

              "text": "Genes collaborate within specific contexts to modulate complex traits, a fundamental aspect crucial for developing innovative therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current understanding of gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease progression remains incomplete. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbations into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes to enhance the contextual analysis of genetic interactions, thereby uncovering potential therapeutic targets that single-gene analyses might overlook. Our findings demonstrate that certain diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that while some functionally important genes lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study not only fills a critical gap by mapping complex gene interactions relevant to diseases but also advances our ability to identify novel therapeutic targets, thereby propelling the field of genetic research and personalized medicine forward.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
