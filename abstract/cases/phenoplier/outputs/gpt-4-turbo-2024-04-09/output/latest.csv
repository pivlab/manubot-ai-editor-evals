Genes interact with one another within specific contexts to fulfill their biological roles. Understanding how these interactions affect complex traits necessitates a detailed knowledge of gene expression regulation under varying conditions. This understanding is vital for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles individual genes play in mechanisms relevant to disease. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical to the genesis and progression of diseases. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent framework for combined analysis. This framework is based on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that key functional players, although not directly associated, are highlighted in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by leveraging groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.

In the realm of genetic research, understanding how genes interact within specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for advancing therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the genesis and progression of diseases. This highlights a critical gap: existing approaches often overlook the collective impact of gene networks. To address this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological data into a unified latent representation. This method leverages modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enhancing our understanding of gene expression regulation and its implications for disease and therapy. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and deciphers drug mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that key functional genes, previously unassociated with traits, are highlighted within these modules. Consequently, PhenoPLIER not only fills the gap in current genetic studies by contextualizing gene interactions but also identifies potential therapeutic targets that single-gene approaches might miss. This approach propels the field toward a more integrative and predictive understanding of genetic contributions to disease, holding implications for drug repurposing and the development of novel treatments.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits",Ends with interpretation of results,Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,"[PASS] (1.00)

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute biological roles. Understanding the mechanistic regulation of gene expression across various conditions is essential for elucidating the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and developing novel therapeutic interventions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the roles of individual genes within disease mechanisms. However, contemporary frameworks suggest that interactions among genes are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for combined analysis. This model leverages gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate significant correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts established drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation revealed that key functional entities, although not directly associated, are highlighted within trait-related gene modules by PhenoPLIER, suggesting a novel method for identifying therapeutic targets.

In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between gene expression and complex traits is pivotal for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, they fall short in capturing the broader gene-gene interactions essential for comprehending disease origins and progression. This gap underscores the need for innovative approaches that can integrate complex gene interaction data to more accurately predict disease associations and potential drug mechanisms. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that leverages a unified latent representation to concurrently analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data. This approach utilizes modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of gene function in disease contexts. Our findings reveal that specific disease states are significantly associated with gene modules active in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER effectively prioritizes key regulatory genes that, while not directly associated with traits, play critical roles in disease-relevant pathways. These results not only fill a crucial gap in our understanding of gene function in complex diseases but also pave the way for novel drug repurposing opportunities and the identification of therapeutic targets, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and its application in personalized medicine.

In the realm of genetics, understanding how genes interact within specific contexts to influence complex traits is pivotal for advancing therapeutic developments. Despite progress through transcriptome-wide association studies in identifying the roles of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests a critical gap: the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression remains underexplored. Addressing this, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational strategy that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation. This model leverages modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions, enabling a comprehensive analysis of their collective impact on diseases. Our findings reveal that disease-associated gene modules are significantly expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates potential mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation highlighted that while some key players lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules. These insights not only bridge a critical knowledge gap by elucidating the complex interplay of gene networks in disease but also enhance our ability to identify novel therapeutic targets, thereby pushing the boundaries of genetic research and its application in medicine.
