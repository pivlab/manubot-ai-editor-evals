          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to study the regulation of gene expression across different
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes involved in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest
          that gene interactions also play a significant role in the origin and
          progression of diseases.


          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Context: Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, and understanding how they regulate expression across
          different conditions is critical for developing new therapies.
          However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression, which cannot be fully
          captured by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) that only
          examine individual genes' roles.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important players lacking associations but present in
          trait-associated modules.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules provides insights into disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms that were previously unattainable through TWAS alone.

          Context: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their functions, and determining how they influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. Although transcriptome-wide association

          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene

          However, there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how to incorporate
          these interactions into our understanding of genetic associations for
          complex traits.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that

          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER

          missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that this
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules provides a more comprehensive understanding of complex
          traits and their underlying mechanisms, advancing our ability to
          develop new therapies based on these insights.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The complex interplay of genes is critical for their function in
          various contexts. Understanding the regulation of gene expression
          across different conditions is essential to determine how these genes
          contribute to complex traits and facilitate the development of new
          therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms, but
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression.


          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational
          approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we find
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
          associations but found within trait-associated modules. Incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis allows PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene module expression patterns. By
          identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms, our approach can aid
          in developing new therapies and repurposing existing drugs for
          improved patient outcomes.

          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          Genetic associations play a crucial role in understanding complex
          traits and developing new therapies. However, the current focus on
          individual genes may overlook important gene-gene interactions that
          influence disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This
          approach moves the field forward by emphasizing the importance of
          considering groups of co-expressed genes in understanding complex
          traits.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. To uncover the
          mechanisms underlying complex traits, it is essential to understand
          how genes work together in specific contexts. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have contributed significantly to identifying
          individual disease-relevant genes; however, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across shared
          conditions. We find that diseases are strongly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important but
          unassociated genes within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions to elucidate their influence on complex traits. This
          knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapeutics.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models
          posit that gene-gene interactions are critical in disease origin and
          progression. PhenoPLIER generates its representation based on modules
          of co-expressed genes with similar patterns across identical
          conditions. We find that diseases significantly associate with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
          associations within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides
          context for genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene module analysis.

          Genetic studies have long focused on identifying individual genes
          associated with complex traits and disease mechanisms. However, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. This paper addresses the gap by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

          influence complex traits requires understanding expression regulation
          across different conditions. 


          Here we demonstrate the use of PhenoPLIER's modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions to analyze
          disease-relevant mechanisms. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. We validate our findings using a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation and show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important players lacking associations in trait-associated modules. 


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to contextualize
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby moving
          forward the broader field by revealing potential therapeutic targets
          missed by previous approaches.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that combines genetic
          associations and pharmacological data into a unified latent
          representation for joint analysis. Genes function in tandem under
          specific conditions to perform their roles; thus, understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts. This
          insight is crucial for developing new treatments. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have aided in identifying the role of individual
          genes within disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models posit
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease onset
          and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules
          comprised of genes with similar expression patterns under identical
          conditions. We found that diseases are strongly associated with gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally crucial elements lacking associations are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
          Consequently, integrating groups of co-expressed genes enables
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In sum, PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          PhenoPLIER: A computational approach for mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. Genes perform their
          functions in specific contexts by acting together, thus understanding
          the regulation of expression across different conditions is crucial to
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical part in disease origin and progression.
          PhenoPLIER uses modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression
          patterns across shared conditions for representation purposes. We
          found significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, which is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed
          that functionally important players without direct associations are
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. Thus,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of gene-trait associations is crucial for understanding
          disease etiology and developing new therapies. While individual genes
          have been identified through transcriptome-wide association studies,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant
          role in complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps genetic and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This allows us to identify modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, which are
          significantly associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lacking direct gene-trait
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          has potential implications for drug repurposing and therapeutic target
          identification.

          Revised paragraph: The complex interplay of genes in specific contexts
          is crucial for understanding their influence on various traits.
          Achieving a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          different conditions is essential for developing effective therapeutic
          strategies. This study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, by analyzing lipid regulation
          using a CRISPR screen, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important players lacking associations within
          trait-associated modules. In summary, incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Gene regulation across different contexts is crucial for understanding
          the functions of genes in complex traits, which has significant
          implications for developing new therapies. However, existing methods
          often focus on individual gene associations and may miss potential
          targets that act in concert with other genes. To address this gap, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that contextualizes genetic
          associations through groups of co-expressed genes. We show that
          diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules

          known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. In
          addition, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found
          that functionally important players without direct associations were
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. Our results

          In this study, we investigate how genes interact with each other in
          specific contexts to influence complex traits. To achieve a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions is crucial for the development of new therapies. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules and revealing potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          There is a gap in the current understanding of how genes influence
          complex traits and their associations with disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Traditional single-gene approaches have limitations, as
          genes act in concert to perform functions across different conditions.
          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an approach that incorporates
          groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations.
          Our results show a significant association between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, our
          analysis reveals that functionally important players lacking direct
          associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules. This novel framework enables the discovery of potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a new perspective
          on genetic associations for complex traits. By incorporating gene
          co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER advances functional genomics and
          provides insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes influence

          Genes perform their functions in specific contexts by working
          together. To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to know how expression regulation works across different
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Our study shows that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs as well as the mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we found
          functionally important players without associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes helps to understand genetic associations
          better and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          PhenoPLIER provides a new way to interpret genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The complex interplay of genes in the regulation of gene expression
          remains a critical gap in our understanding of disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to bridge this gap by
          examining how co-expressed gene modules influence complex traits. Our
          approach involved using PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. We found that diseases are significantly associated with

          Genetic studies often involve the examination of how individual genes
          contribute to complex traits and diseases. However, it is now widely
          recognized that genes do not function in isolation but rather work
          together in specific contexts to perform their functions. To fully
          understand this intricate interplay between genes, a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions is essential. Such an understanding can be crucial for
          developing new therapies.


          In our study, we have demonstrated the significant association between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
          insights into their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players lacking direct associations were prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          PhenoPLIER is a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, it can contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          Our findings suggest that this approach can provide valuable insights
          into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, as well as contribute to
          the repurposing of existing drugs for new indications. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for functional genomics studies
          aimed at understanding complex traits and developing innovative
          therapeutic approaches.

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Context: The study of gene expression patterns and their relationship
          to complex traits is a critical area in genetic research, with
          implications for the development of new therapies. However, there is a
          lack of understanding about how genes interact with each other to
          influence these traits. This gap hinders our ability to accurately
          predict drug-disease associations and mechanisms of action.


          Content: To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel
          framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes into the
          analysis of genetic associations. We found that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
          important players lacking direct genetic associations can be
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.


          Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate the broader
          significance of this approach in advancing our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the complex interplay of genetic regulation, genes work together in
          specific contexts to carry out their functions. To comprehend how
          these genes contribute to intricate traits, it is crucial to
          understand expression regulation across diverse conditions. This
          insight is essential for developing innovative therapeutic approaches.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
          individual genes play in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          theories of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in both the onset and progression of
          diseases.


          Here, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational methodology that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is grounded on modules comprising genes with similar expression
          patterns across corresponding conditions. We observe substantial
          correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          by leveraging CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally significant players lacking associations but prioritized
          within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires
          knowledge of expression regulation across various conditions, which is
          essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have revealed the role individual genes play in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease origin and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          findings show that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discover that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The study of gene-gene interactions in complex traits is crucial for
          understanding disease origin and progression, but existing methods
          focus on individual genes. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          revealed the role of single genes in disease mechanisms, yet modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are equally important. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is
          based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions and
          reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. We validate our approach using known
          drug-disease pairs and find it to be highly accurate in predicting
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility by
          analyzing lipid regulation with a CRISPR screen, revealing
          functionally important players that lack genetic associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our
          study highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression
          patterns for understanding disease etiology and identifying
          therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is important to
          study expression regulation across different conditions. This

          association studies have helped us discover the role of individual

          Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
          specific contexts, and a mechanistic understanding of their expression
          regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease origin and progression. This gap highlights the need to
          uncover how these interactions contribute to complex traits and their
          therapeutic targets.


          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant
          conditions and cell types. We show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in the same cell type, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated
          modules.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel method for predicting disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms through gene expression patterns, which
          can inform the development of new therapeutic targets. This approach
          fills an essential gap in our understanding of complex traits and
          their underlying genetic interactions, highlighting its broader
          significance in advancing functional genomics research and drug
          repurposing strategies.

          In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying complex traits, it is
          crucial to understand how genes interact and regulate their expression
          across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          provided valuable insights into individual gene contributions to
          disease processes; however, the intricate architecture of complex
          traits necessitates the consideration of gene-gene interactions as
          well. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER – a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data within a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is built upon
          modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal significant disease-module
          associations in relevant cell types, as well as high accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens,
          we identify functionally important players lacking direct associations
          but prioritized within trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's
          analysis.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here

            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to study the regulation of gene expression across
              different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              identify individual genes involved in disease mechanisms. However,
              modern models suggest that gene interactions also play a
              significant role in the origin and progression of diseases.


              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


              Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              In the study of complex traits, it is essential to understand how
              genes function together in specific contexts. Transcriptome-wide

              disease mechanisms; however, models predict that gene-gene

              Context: Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they regulate expression across
              different conditions is critical for developing new therapies.
              However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a

              fully captured by transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
              that only examine individual genes' roles.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This

              Additionally, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
              players lacking associations but present in trait-associated
              modules.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              discover that functionally important players lacking associations
              can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.
              In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Context: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts
              to perform their functions, and determining how they influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. Although
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. However, there is a gap in our knowledge
              regarding how to incorporate these interactions into our
              understanding of genetic associations for complex traits.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              demonstrate that this novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules provides a more
              comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying
              mechanisms, advancing our ability to develop new therapies based
              on these insights.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel

              The complex interplay of genes is critical for their function in
              various contexts. Understanding the regulation of gene expression
              across different conditions is essential to determine how these
              genes contribute to complex traits and facilitate the development
              of new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual genes' involvement in
              disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression.


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational
              approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action.


              Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players
              lacking associations but found within trait-associated modules.
              Incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis
              allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through gene module expression
              patterns. By identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms, our
              approach can aid in developing new therapies and repurposing
              existing drugs for improved patient outcomes.

              Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
              specific contexts, and understanding expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered

              to contextualize genetic associations by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to
              identify disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types accurately. Our approach predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action, revealing potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing them and
              identifying potential therapeutic targets.

              Genes interact in specific contexts to perform their functions,
              necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions for determining how they
              influence complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              contributed significantly to the identification of individual
              genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an essential role
              in the onset and progression of diseases.

              significant associations between disease phenotypes and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action,
              and identifies functionally important players without direct
              genetic associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. To uncover the
              mechanisms underlying complex traits, it is essential to
              understand how genes work together in specific contexts.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to identifying individual disease-relevant genes;
              however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across shared conditions. We find that
              diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important
              but unassociated genes within trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by

              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Context: Genes act in concert to perform their functions and
              influence complex traits, with a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions being critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms but modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, moving the broader
              field forward in understanding complex traits and identifying
              therapeutic targets.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work
              together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
              necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions to elucidate their influence on complex
              traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel
              therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              identified individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms;
              however, modern models posit that gene-gene interactions are
              critical in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER generates
              its representation based on modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar patterns across identical conditions. We find that
              diseases significantly associate with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
              associations within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides
              context for genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through gene module analysis.

              In the study of complex traits, understanding how genes interact
              is crucial for identifying therapeutic targets and developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              to our knowledge of individual gene roles in disease mechanisms,
              but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach we introduce, maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Genes act together in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how
              these genes influence complex traits requires knowledge of
              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover individual gene roles in
              disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions.
              We observe diseases associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
              modules.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              Genetic studies have long focused on identifying individual genes
              associated with complex traits and disease mechanisms. However,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. This paper addresses the
              gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert with each other to perform their functions, and
              determining how they influence complex traits requires
              understanding expression regulation across different conditions. 


              Here we demonstrate the use of PhenoPLIER's modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions to analyze
              disease-relevant mechanisms. Our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. We validate our findings
              using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation and show that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
              associations in trait-associated modules. 


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to
              contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, thereby moving forward the broader field by revealing
              potential therapeutic targets missed by previous approaches.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that combines
              genetic associations and pharmacological data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function in tandem
              under specific conditions to perform their roles; thus,
              understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across diverse contexts. This insight is crucial for developing
              new treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided
              in identifying the role of individual genes within disease
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models posit that gene-gene
              interactions significantly contribute to disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules
              comprised of genes with similar expression patterns under
              identical conditions. We found that diseases are strongly
              associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types,
              and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally
              crucial elements lacking associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Consequently, integrating
              groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. In sum, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              PhenoPLIER: A computational approach for mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. Genes perform their
              functions in specific contexts by acting together, thus
              understanding the regulation of expression across different
              conditions is crucial to developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical part in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER uses modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across shared conditions for
              representation purposes. We found significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, which
              is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of
              lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players
              without direct associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated modules. Thus, incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              The study of gene-trait associations is crucial for understanding
              disease etiology and developing new therapies. While individual
              genes have been identified through transcriptome-wide association
              studies, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in complex traits. To address this gap, we

              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              modules and has potential implications for drug repurposing and

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              In this study, we investigate how genes interact with each other
              in specific contexts to influence complex traits. To achieve a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for the development of new
              therapies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening
              to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important
              players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
              trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
              revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.

              There is a gap in the current understanding of how genes influence
              complex traits and their associations with disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. Traditional single-gene approaches have
              limitations, as genes act in concert to perform functions across
              different conditions. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an
              approach that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations. Our results show a significant
              association between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis reveals
              that functionally important players lacking direct associations
              are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. This
              novel framework enables the discovery of potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies, providing a new perspective on genetic
              associations for complex traits. By incorporating gene
              co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER advances functional genomics
              and provides insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing.

              Genes perform their functions in specific contexts by working
              together. To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is
              important to know how expression regulation works across different
              conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
              therapies. Our study shows that diseases are strongly linked to
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs as well as the mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR
              screen, we found functionally important players without
              associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes helps to understand genetic associations better and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a new way to interpret genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules.

              The complex interplay of genes in the regulation of gene
              expression remains a critical gap in our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to bridge
              this gap by examining how co-expressed gene modules influence
              complex traits. Our approach involved using PhenoPLIER to
              contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. We found that diseases
              are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, we discovered that functionally
              important players lacking genetic associations were prioritized by
              PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen

              the importance of considering groups of co-expressed genes to
              uncover potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies and provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, advancing our

              Genetic studies often involve the examination of how individual
              genes contribute to complex traits and diseases. However, it is
              now widely recognized that genes do not function in isolation but
              rather work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To fully understand this intricate interplay between
              genes, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
              across different conditions is essential. Such an understanding
              can be crucial for developing new therapies.


              In our study, we have demonstrated the significant association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and provides insights into their mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lacking direct associations were
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              PhenoPLIER is a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, it can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our findings suggest that this approach
              can provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, as well as contribute to the repurposing of existing
              drugs for new indications. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful
              tool for functional genomics studies aimed at understanding
              complex traits and developing innovative therapeutic approaches.

              Context: The study of gene expression patterns and their
              relationship to complex traits is a critical area in genetic
              research, with implications for the development of new therapies.
              However, there is a lack of understanding about how genes interact
              with each other to influence these traits. This gap hinders our
              ability to accurately predict drug-disease associations and
              mechanisms of action.


              Content: To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel
              framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes into the
              analysis of genetic associations. We found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In
              addition, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally important players lacking direct
              genetic associations can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated modules.


              Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals potential therapeutic
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate
              the broader significance of this approach in advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genes perform their functions in specific contexts by working
              together. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is essential to have a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have contributed to uncovering the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. To address this issue, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
              important players lacking associations were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the complex interplay of genetic regulation, genes work
              together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. To
              comprehend how these genes contribute to intricate traits, it is
              crucial to understand expression regulation across diverse
              conditions. This insight is essential for developing innovative
              therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role individual genes play in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern theories of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal
              in both the onset and progression of diseases.


              Here, we present PhenoPLIER - a computational methodology that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              onto a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is grounded on modules comprising genes with
              similar expression patterns across corresponding conditions. We
              observe substantial correlations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach demonstrates
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by leveraging CRISPR screens to
              analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally significant
              players lacking associations but prioritized within
              trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.

              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires knowledge of expression regulation across various
              conditions, which is essential for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role
              individual genes play in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that

              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              that functionally important players lacking associations are

              The study of gene-gene interactions in complex traits is crucial
              for understanding disease origin and progression, but existing
              methods focus on individual genes. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed the role of single genes in disease
              mechanisms, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
              are equally important. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions and
              reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. We validate our approach using
              known drug-disease pairs and find it to be highly accurate in
              predicting mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate its
              utility by analyzing lipid regulation with a CRISPR screen,
              revealing functionally important players that lack genetic
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study highlights the importance of
              considering gene co-expression patterns for understanding disease
              etiology and identifying therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

              mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene interactions

              Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
              specific contexts, and a mechanistic understanding of their
              expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
              progression. This gap highlights the need to uncover how these
              interactions contribute to complex traits and their therapeutic
              targets.


              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              relevant conditions and cell types. We show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in the same
              cell type, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lacking associations are prioritized by
              PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel method for predicting
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms through gene expression
              patterns, which can inform the development of new therapeutic
              targets. This approach fills an essential gap in our understanding
              of complex traits and their underlying genetic interactions,
              highlighting its broader significance in advancing functional
              genomics research and drug repurposing strategies.

              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying complex traits, it
              is crucial to understand how genes interact and regulate their
              expression across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have provided valuable insights into
              individual gene contributions to disease processes; however, the
              intricate architecture of complex traits necessitates the
              consideration of gene-gene interactions as well. To address this
              gap, we present PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data within a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is built upon modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions.
              Our findings reveal significant disease-module associations in
              relevant cell types, as well as high accuracy in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              by analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we identify
              functionally important players lacking direct associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER's
              analysis.

              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
