          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genetic studies have long been used to understand the role of
          individual genes in complex traits and diseases. However, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions also play a crucial part in
          these processes. In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show that
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players lacking
          associations but found in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This approach moves the field forward by offering a more
          comprehensive understanding of complex traits and disease etiology,
          with broader implications for therapeutic target identification and
          drug repurposing.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Understanding the regulation of gene expression across different
          conditions is crucial for elucidating how genes influence complex
          traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
          progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on
          modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, making our approach accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this

          Context: Genes play a critical role in complex traits and disease
          progression through their interactions. While individual gene
          associations have been studied using transcriptome-wide association
          studies, there is a gap in understanding the significance of gene-gene
          interactions in these processes.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations within
          trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          diseases. However, there has been no computational approach available
          to map these gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation
          data for joint analysis.

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. PhenoPLIER also identifies
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritizes
          them in trait-associated modules through its analysis.

          In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations to reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules provides a significant advancement in understanding
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function in
          concert with one another within specific contexts to perform their
          functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have contributed significantly to our understanding of individual

          lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking

          genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups, revealing
          potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies might miss.
          This novel framework interprets genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work
          together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, making it
          essential to understand how expression regulation across different
          conditions influences complex traits. This insight is vital for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in the origin and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER bases its
          representation on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across conditions. We observed significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid
          regulation, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important players lacking associations but are present in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Context: Modern models of complex trait architecture predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, these
          approaches often overlook the importance of gene co-expression.


          Content: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach mapping gene-trait associations into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Genes act in concert to perform
          their functions under specific conditions, and our approach focuses on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across these
          conditions. We demonstrate that disease traits are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, making
          PhenoPLIER accurate at predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players
          lacking associations can be prioritized through trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations offers a more comprehensive view of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, moving the broader field forward
          in understanding complex trait architecture and facilitating drug
          repurposing efforts.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By
          considering genes as acting together in specific contexts to perform
          their functions, PhenoPLIER offers valuable insights into the
          regulation of expression across different conditions, which is
          essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been successful in identifying individual
          gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are vital to understanding complex trait
          origins and progression.


          PhenoPLIER's representation utilizes modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We observed
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a
          CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that functionally
          important players without direct associations are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This novel framework interprets genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          This manuscript presents a new computational approach called
          PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This study addresses the gap in current transcriptome-wide
          association studies that focus on individual genes instead of
          understanding the mechanisms behind complex traits by analyzing
          gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across conditions, which are significantly
          associated with diseases and have been shown to be accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. The study also demonstrates that functionally important
          players lacking associations can be prioritized through
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations provides a better understanding of
          disease etiology, therapeutic targets, and drug repurposing by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes.

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology
          that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes
          typically work together in specific contexts to fulfill their
          functions; therefore, understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits necessitates an in-depth comprehension of expression regulation
          across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have aided in identifying individual gene roles within
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, current models suggest that
          interactions between genes significantly contribute to both the origin
          and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on
          modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, making
          our approach highly accurate for predicting known drug-disease pairs
          and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing functionally significant
          players lacking direct associations but prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's
          incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the
          contextualization of genetic associations and identifies potential
          targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. We
          propose that PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through gene module analysis.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The identification of genes associated with complex traits and disease
          mechanisms has been a focus in genetic studies. However, understanding
          how these genes interact with each other to influence disease
          progression remains an open question. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations into a common latent representation for joint analysis.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across specific conditions, which are significantly associated with
          diseases and cell types relevant to the disease process. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides novel
          insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits and potential
          therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, demonstrating its ability to contextualize
          genetic associations through gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations in
          functional genomics and provides valuable insights into disease
          etiology and therapeutic targets.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
          that integrates genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. To fully
          understand the impact of genes on complex traits, it is crucial to
          decipher their expression regulation across various conditions. Recent
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the individual
          roles of genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease onset
          and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation focuses on modules of
          co-expressed genes with similar patterns under identical conditions.
          We find that diseases are strongly associated with these expression
          modules within relevant cell types, enabling accurate prediction of
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
          observe that functionally important genes lacking direct associations
          can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          summary, incorporating co-expressed gene groups allows PhenoPLIER to
          provide context for genetic associations and identify potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches. Our approach
          offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Complex traits are influenced by the collective action of genes, yet
          understanding their regulatory mechanisms is challenging.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          disease-relevant genes; however, gene-gene interactions remain crucial
          in the onset and progression of diseases. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations into a latent representation based on similar expression
          patterns across conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling
          accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of
          action. By integrating co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides new
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies and offers a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and
          potential treatment options.

          Genes function in concert with one another under specific conditions
          to carry out their roles. Understanding how these genes regulate
          expression across different contexts is crucial for elucidating the
          mechanisms underlying complex traits and developing new therapies.
          This study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          we find that functionally important players without direct
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
          enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. The use of
          gene modules in PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations and offers valuable insights into disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          essential to have a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing
          new therapies. Our study's findings show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players
          lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework offers a new perspective on interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Part #1: The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper
          will fill.

          Usage: "Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions." This meets the criteria because it introduces the broader
          field and sets up an open question about understanding gene function
          in relation to complex traits. 


          Part #2: The content ("Here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then, present the
          results.

          Usage: "In this study, here we show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types." This
          meets the criteria because it introduces a new approach (gene module
          analysis) and presents a key result related to disease associations. 


          Part #3: Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
          question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is
          often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies." This meets the criteria
          because it interprets the results in terms of a new method's ability
          to improve target discovery. The broader significance is highlighted
          with: "...PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules," suggesting its
          potential impact on future research in this field.

          The field of genetic studies is critical for understanding the
          mechanisms that underlie complex traits and diseases. However, current
          approaches often focus on single genes rather than groups of
          co-expressed genes, which may limit our ability to fully understand
          these processes. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by using a
          novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types to contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we found that
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack
          associations through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In
          conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of PhenoPLIER as a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms that may inform future therapeutic strategies.

          Genes operate in coordination with each other under specific
          circumstances to execute their functions. Unraveling the impact of
          these genes on complex traits necessitates a thorough understanding of
          expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is essential
          for developing novel therapeutic approaches. This study presents
          evidence that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types and demonstrates the accuracy
          of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, by leveraging CRISPR screening to
          analyze lipid regulation, we have identified functionally important
          players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within
          trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to provide a
          contextual understanding of genetic associations and uncover potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Consequently, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules in functional
          genomics, paving the way for drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits.

          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Context: Despite the knowledge that genes function together in
          specific contexts, understanding their influence on complex traits
          requires a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across
          different conditions. This is essential for developing new therapies
          and filling the gap in our current understanding of how gene modules
          contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


          Content: Here we present PhenoPLIER, an approach that contextualizes
          genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes.
          Our study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we also
          find that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: By incorporating co-expressed genes into the analysis,
          PhenoPLIER can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies and provide novel insights into disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach not only answers our
          initial question of how gene modules contribute to complex traits but
          also moves the broader field forward in interpreting genetic
          associations through a more comprehensive lens.

          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated

          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the field of functional genomics, there is a critical need to
          understand how genes influence complex traits through their
          coordinated expression. This knowledge is essential for developing new
          therapies and addressing the current gap in our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here we present PhenoPLIER, an
          innovative approach that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show
          that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players lacking
          direct associations using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, moving the
          broader field forward by offering insights into disease etiology and
          identifying promising therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

          Genes operate collectively in specific contexts to fulfill their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions. Such insight is vital for the development
          of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          contributed significantly to our understanding of individual gene
          roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play an
          essential role in the onset and progression of diseases. In this

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is built upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          across identical conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen

          understudied players are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER.

          The complex traits observed in diseases result from the concerted
          action of multiple genes across different conditions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insight into the
          role of individual genes, but understanding gene-gene interactions is
          crucial for disease origin and progression. This gap limits our
          ability to develop new therapies and repurpose existing drugs
          effectively. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates genetic associations with gene expression patterns
          across conditions. Our approach clusters genes based on their
          similarity in expression profiles under specific conditions, creating
          modules of co-expressed genes relevant for disease mechanisms. We show
          that diseases are associated with these modules and predict known
          drug-disease pairs accurately. Additionally, our method prioritizes
          functionally important players without direct genetic associations by
          analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR screens. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to understand the etiology of
          complex traits and identify potential therapeutic targets for disease
          treatment or repurposing existing drugs.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how these genes affect complex traits, we need to know
          how expression regulation works across different conditions. This
          knowledge is crucial for creating new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped us discover the roles of individual
          genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models suggest
          that gene interactions are very important in causing and progressing
          diseases. 


          In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computer method to study how
          genes affect traits and how drugs can change these effects. This
          method uses groups of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions for analysis. We found out that diseases are
          connected to gene groups expressed in related cell types. Our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and understands their
          action mechanisms. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid
          regulation, we discovered important players without associations but
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.

          Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
          specific contexts. Understanding the regulation of gene expression
          across different conditions is critical for developing new therapies,
          and transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insight into
          individual gene roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. This paper fills the gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data for joint analysis based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions.
          We observe significant disease association with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types and accurate prediction of known drug-disease
          pairs and mechanisms of action using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid
          regulation, revealing functionally important players lacking direct
          associations prioritized by PhenoPLIER. This approach advances our
          understanding of complex trait architecture and provides a framework
          for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

          Genes function in concert with one another under specific

          contribute to complex traits, it is essential to have a mechanistic

          insight is crucial for the development of new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in

          The context: The study of gene-gene interactions in complex traits is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, but understanding how these genes work together is crucial
          to further advances in this field. Modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease origin and
          progression. However, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding
          the joint analysis of genetic associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data.

          The content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across conditions. We demonstrate its accuracy in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find
          that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules.

          The conclusion: Our approach provides a new framework for
          understanding the mechanistic basis of complex traits through joint
          analysis of genetic and pharmacological data. By identifying
          disease-relevant genes and drug targets in specific cellular contexts,
          we offer novel insights into the development of therapeutic strategies
          for various diseases. This work represents an important step forward
          in our ability to understand how gene networks contribute to the
          etiology and progression of complex disorders.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In complex traits, genes work together in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. To understand how these genes influence these traits,
          it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players lacking associations were prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The complex nature of genetic diseases requires a deeper understanding
          of gene-gene interactions and expression regulation across different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
          individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, they fail to account
          for the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
          progression. This study aims to fill this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By focusing on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our
          results show significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, we demonstrate
          the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally
          important players that lack direct genetic associations but are
          prioritized by trait-associated modules. Overall, our approach
          provides a novel method for understanding complex traits and
          highlights its potential in therapeutic target identification and drug
          repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The complex architecture of human traits involves the intricate
          interplay between genes and their interactions. While individual gene
          associations have been revealed through transcriptome-wide association
          studies, a comprehensive understanding of the role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology remains elusive. This knowledge is
          crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches. To address this
          gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          genetic and pharmacological data into a unified latent representation
          based on co-expressed gene modules across specific conditions. By
          analyzing disease associations with these modules, we uncover
          significant links between diseases and cell types relevant to their
          manifestation. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing
          CRISPR screens for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated
          modules, even when they lack direct genetic associations. Overall,
          this study highlights the potential of using gene co-expression
          patterns to unravel disease etiology and advance drug repurposing
          efforts, thereby moving the field of functional genomics forward in
          understanding complex traits.

              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,

              Genetic studies have long been used to understand the role of
              individual genes in complex traits and diseases. However, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions also play a crucial
              part in these processes. In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              In the study of complex traits, it is crucial to understand how
              genes interact with each other in specific contexts. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              individual gene roles, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps genetic associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important players lacking genetic associations by
              identifying trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies and advancing our understanding
              of complex traits.

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Understanding the regulation of gene expression across different

              traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide

              Context: Genes play a critical role in complex traits and disease
              progression through their interactions. While individual gene
              associations have been studied using transcriptome-wide

              specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how
              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              The regulation of gene expression across different conditions is
              critical for understanding the influence of genes on complex
              traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              the origin and progression of diseases. However, there has been no
              computational approach available to map these gene-trait
              associations with pharmacological perturbation data for joint
              analysis.

              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              PhenoPLIER also identifies functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritizes them in trait-associated modules
              through its analysis.

              In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations to reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the lens of gene modules provides a significant advancement in
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes function in concert with one another within
              specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various
              conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to our understanding of individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a critical role in complex trait
              origins and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions. We observe significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed within relevant cell
              types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally
              important players lacking individual trait associations but
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through
              co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential therapeutic targets
              that single-gene strategies might miss. This novel framework
              interprets genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
              providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, making it essential to understand how expression
              regulation across different conditions influences complex traits.
              This insight is vital for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual
              genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
              progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER bases its representation on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              conditions. We observed significant associations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze
              lipid regulation, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important players lacking associations but are
              present in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. It provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene
              module analysis.

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of

              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Context: Modern models of complex trait architecture predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, these
              approaches often overlook the importance of gene co-expression.


              Content: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach mapping gene-trait associations into a
              common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert to perform their functions under specific conditions, and
              our approach focuses on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across these conditions. We demonstrate that disease
              traits are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, making PhenoPLIER accurate at predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              show that functionally important players lacking associations can
              be prioritized through trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations offers a more
              comprehensive view of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, moving
              the broader field forward in understanding complex trait
              architecture and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. By considering genes as acting together in specific
              contexts to perform their functions, PhenoPLIER offers valuable
              insights into the regulation of expression across different
              conditions, which is essential for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              identifying individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to
              understanding complex trait origins and progression.


              PhenoPLIER's representation utilizes modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observed
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally important players without direct associations
              are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. This novel framework interprets genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              This manuscript presents a new computational approach called
              PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

              transcriptome-wide association studies that focus on individual
              genes instead of understanding the mechanisms behind complex
              traits by analyzing gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's approach
              is based on modules of co-expressed genes across conditions, which
              are significantly associated with diseases and have been shown to
              be accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. The study also demonstrates that
              functionally important players lacking associations can be
              prioritized through trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations provides a
              better understanding of disease etiology, therapeutic targets, and
              drug repurposing by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              methodology that combines gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. Genes typically work together
              in specific contexts to fulfill their functions; therefore,
              understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates an in-depth comprehension of expression regulation
              across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the
              development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have aided in identifying individual gene roles within
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, current models suggest that
              interactions between genes significantly contribute to both the
              origin and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation
              relies on modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns
              across identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that
              diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, making our approach highly accurate for
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, revealing functionally significant players lacking
              direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation
              of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of
              genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may
              have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. We propose that
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through gene module analysis.

              The identification of genes associated with complex traits and
              disease mechanisms has been a focus in genetic studies. However,
              understanding how these genes interact with each other to
              influence disease progression remains an open question. To address
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations into a common latent representation
              for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across specific conditions, which
              are significantly associated with diseases and cell types relevant
              to the disease process. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides novel insights into the mechanisms
              underlying complex traits and potential therapeutic targets that
              may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              demonstrating its ability to contextualize genetic associations
              through gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new
              framework for interpreting genetic associations in functional
              genomics and provides valuable insights into disease etiology and
              therapeutic targets.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method
              that integrates genetic associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. To fully understand the impact of genes on complex
              traits, it is crucial to decipher their expression regulation
              across various conditions. Recent transcriptome-wide association
              studies have uncovered the individual roles of genes in disease
              mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions significantly contribute to disease onset and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation focuses on modules of
              co-expressed genes with similar patterns under identical
              conditions. We find that diseases are strongly associated with
              these expression modules within relevant cell types, enabling
              accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we observe that functionally important genes
              lacking direct associations can be prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating co-expressed gene
              groups allows PhenoPLIER to provide context for genetic
              associations and identify potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene approaches. Our approach offers a unique framework for

              Complex traits are influenced by the collective action of genes,

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes function in concert with one another under specific
              conditions to carry out their roles. Understanding how these genes
              regulate expression across different contexts is crucial for
              elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and
              developing new therapies. This study demonstrates that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players without direct associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. The use of
              gene modules in PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations and offers valuable insights
              into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Context: Genes act in concert with each other to perform their
              functions, making it crucial to understand expression regulation
              across different conditions for determining how they influence

              accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of
              action using gene modules.


              Content: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease

              CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players lacking

              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic

              Usage: "Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions." This meets the criteria because it
              introduces the broader field and sets up an open question about
              understanding gene function in relation to complex traits. 


              Part #2: The content ("Here we") first describes the novel method
              or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then,
              present the results.

              Usage: "In this study, here we show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types." This meets the criteria because it introduces a new
              approach (gene module analysis) and presents a key result related
              to disease associations.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is necessary to have a clear understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial
              for developing new therapies. In this study, our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, using
              CRISPR screening technology, we analyzed lipid regulation to
              identify functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can

              The field of genetic studies is critical for understanding the
              mechanisms that underlie complex traits and diseases. However,
              current approaches often focus on single genes rather than groups
              of co-expressed genes, which may limit our ability to fully
              understand these processes. In this study, we aim to fill this gap
              by using a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that
              may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

              Additionally, we found that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally

              analysis of lipid regulation. In conclusion, our study
              demonstrates the potential of PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms that may inform future therapeutic strategies.

              Genes operate in coordination with each other under specific
              circumstances to execute their functions. Unraveling the impact of
              these genes on complex traits necessitates a thorough
              understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions,
              which is essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches.
              This study presents evidence that diseases exhibit significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types
              and demonstrates the accuracy of our approach in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, by leveraging CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
              regulation, we have identified functionally important players
              lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within
              trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to

              uncover potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by

              Context: Despite the knowledge that genes function together in
              specific contexts, understanding their influence on complex traits
              requires a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across
              different conditions. This is essential for developing new
              therapies and filling the gap in our current understanding of how
              gene modules contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


              Content: Here we present PhenoPLIER, an approach that
              contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes. Our study reveals significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we also find that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating co-expressed genes into the analysis,
              PhenoPLIER can reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies and provide novel insights into disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach not only answers our
              initial question of how gene modules contribute to complex traits
              but also moves the broader field forward in interpreting genetic
              associations through a more comprehensive lens.

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. Our research shows that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. We also analyzed
              lipid regulation using CRISPR screens and found that PhenoPLIER
              can identify important players that lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by

              In the field of functional genomics, there is a critical need to
              understand how genes influence complex traits through their
              coordinated expression. This knowledge is essential for developing
              new therapies and addressing the current gap in our understanding
              of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here we present
              PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that incorporates groups of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we show that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players lacking
              direct associations using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, moving the broader field forward by offering insights
              into disease etiology and identifying promising therapeutic

              Genes operate collectively in specific contexts to fulfill their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions. Such insight is vital for
              the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of
              individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play an essential role in the onset and progression
              of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is built
              upon modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
              across identical conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit
              significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a

              The complex traits observed in diseases result from the concerted
              action of multiple genes across different conditions.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insight into
              the role of individual genes, but understanding gene-gene
              interactions is crucial for disease origin and progression. This
              gap limits our ability to develop new therapies and repurpose
              existing drugs effectively. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates genetic associations with
              gene expression patterns across conditions. Our approach clusters
              genes based on their similarity in expression profiles under
              specific conditions, creating modules of co-expressed genes
              relevant for disease mechanisms. We show that diseases are
              associated with these modules and predict known drug-disease pairs
              accurately. Additionally, our method prioritizes functionally
              important players without direct genetic associations by analyzing
              lipid regulation using CRISPR screens. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework to understand the etiology of complex
              traits and identify potential therapeutic targets for disease
              treatment or repurposing existing drugs.

              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To understand how these genes affect complex traits, we
              need to know how expression regulation works across different
              conditions. This knowledge is crucial for creating new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped us discover the
              roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              modern models suggest that gene interactions are very important in
              causing and progressing diseases. 


              In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computer method to study
              how genes affect traits and how drugs can change these effects.
              This method uses groups of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions for analysis. We found out that
              diseases are connected to gene groups expressed in related cell
              types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              understands their action mechanisms. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to study lipid regulation, we discovered important players
              without associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated modules.

              Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
              specific contexts. Understanding the regulation of gene expression
              across different conditions is critical for developing new
              therapies, and transcriptome-wide association studies have
              provided insight into individual gene roles in disease mechanisms.
              However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. This paper fills
              the gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that

              for joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar

              advances our understanding of complex trait architecture and
              provides a framework for identifying therapeutic targets and

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes function in concert with one another under specific
              circumstances to perform their roles. To comprehend how these
              genes contribute to complex traits, it is essential to have a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various
              conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in uncovering the role individual genes play in

              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions

              The context: The study of gene-gene interactions in complex traits
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, but understanding how these genes
              work together is crucial to further advances in this field. Modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in
              disease origin and progression. However, there remains a gap in
              our knowledge regarding the joint analysis of genetic associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data.

              The content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions. We demonstrate its
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screen to analyze

              lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated gene modules.

              The conclusion: Our approach provides a new framework for
              understanding the mechanistic basis of complex traits through
              joint analysis of genetic and pharmacological data. By identifying
              disease-relevant genes and drug targets in specific cellular
              contexts, we offer novel insights into the development of
              therapeutic strategies for various diseases. This work represents
              an important step forward in our ability to understand how gene
              networks contribute to the etiology and progression of complex
              disorders.

              In complex traits, genes work together in specific contexts to

              The complex nature of genetic diseases requires a deeper
              understanding of gene-gene interactions and expression regulation
              across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed individual genes' roles in disease
              mechanisms, they fail to account for the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease origin and progression. This study aims to
              fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By focusing on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, our results show significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Additionally, we demonstrate the accuracy of
              PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally
              important players that lack direct genetic associations but are
              prioritized by trait-associated modules. Overall, our approach
              provides a novel method for understanding complex traits and
              highlights its potential in therapeutic target identification and
              drug repurposing.

              interplay between genes and their interactions. While individual
              gene associations have been revealed through transcriptome-wide
              association studies, a comprehensive understanding of the role of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains elusive. This
              knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapeutic approaches.
              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates genetic and pharmacological data into a
              unified latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules
              across specific conditions. By analyzing disease associations with
              these modules, we uncover significant links between diseases and
              cell types relevant to their manifestation. Furthermore, our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing CRISPR screens for
              lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even
              when they lack direct genetic associations. Overall, this study
              highlights the potential of using gene co-expression patterns to
              unravel disease etiology and advance drug repurposing efforts,
              thereby moving the field of functional genomics forward in
              understanding complex traits.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits'. Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
