 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint analysis based on a common latent representation. This representation is derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a promising approach for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

This innovative framework facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations in light of gene modules, offering promising avenues for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in a cooperative manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions to decipher how these genes impact complex traits, particularly in the context of disease etiology and therapy development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, there is growing evidence supporting the critical role of gene-gene interactions in the origin and progression of complex traits.

PhenoPLIER's methodology relies on the organization of genes into modules based on their similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes, which may not have individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

As a result, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, offering valuable insights into disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and therapeutic target discovery.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's methodology relies on grouping genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions into modules. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that may be overlooked through traditional single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a valuable approach for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics and provides a useful tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

 Genes function collaboratively in specific contexts to execute their roles, and a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is critical for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes' role in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings suggest that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important genes lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. By clustering genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, our method identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in specific cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as its ability to prioritize functionally important players lacking individual gene associations in trait-associated modules. Our findings underscore the importance of considering gene co-expression and functional genomics in uncovering therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing for complex traits.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, the modern perspective on complex trait architecture suggests that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from gene modules displaying similar expression patterns across corresponding conditions. Our results indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.","[PASS] (1.00)  In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.
