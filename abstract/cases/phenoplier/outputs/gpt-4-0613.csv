Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\""Here we\"") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \""broader significance\"").\n\nInput paragraph: {{ paragraph }}\n\nRevised paragraph:"",""display"":""/home/miltondp/projects/others/manubot/manubot-ai-editor-evals/abstract/prompts/candidate.txt"",""id"":""1dd365a9bb4d181580c711f92234a3eb9f11ee68b4877763e27cf57607fb0222"",""metrics"":{""score"":20,""testPassCount"":20,""testFailCount"":0,""assertPassCount"":160,""assertFailCount"":0,""totalLatencyMs"":195548,""tokenUsage"":{""total"":16456,""prompt"":11720,""completion"":4736,""cached"":0},""namedScores"":{}}}",keywords,paragraph,test_description,title

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute their roles.
