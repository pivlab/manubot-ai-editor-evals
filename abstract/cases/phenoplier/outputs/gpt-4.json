Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact in specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the role of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets. This approach advances the field by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in disease mechanisms and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their regulation across different conditions. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach could potentially identify therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, advancing the field of genetic studies and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their regulation across different conditions. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in disease progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.",

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby filling the gap in our understanding of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology. This approach not only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also identifies potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation showed that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in disease progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.",

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We note that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach advances our understanding of complex trait clustering and offers new avenues for drug repurposing.",

Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes collectively influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules but also reveals potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement could significantly contribute to the fields of genetic studies, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing.",

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.",

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally important players, often overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes impact complex traits. This understanding is pivotal for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Our study demonstrates a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly correlated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In a specific application, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules but also reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement could significantly contribute to the fields of genetic studies, drug repurposing, and the clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes impact complex traits.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these interactions and their implications for disease and drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that while some functionally important players lack associations, they are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only enhance our understanding of disease etiology but also provide a novel approach for identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact in specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the role of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets. This approach advances the field by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in disease mechanisms and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.

To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.

To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation showed that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach advances our understanding of gene co-expression in disease progression and drug mechanisms, offering new avenues for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

              "text": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations, highlighting disease etiology, and revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach advances our understanding of complex trait clustering and offers new avenues for drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes collectively influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules but also reveals potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement could significantly contribute to the fields of genetic studies, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally important players, often overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes collectively influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We developed a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally important players, often overlooked in single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach has broader implications for genetic studies, potentially revolutionizing the identification of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              "text": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This study addresses this gap by demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We introduce a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Our results, including a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, reveal that functionally important players, often overlooked in single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets. This approach advances the broader field by highlighting the importance of considering gene co-expression in genetic studies and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

However, a gap exists in our mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In a specific application, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only enhances our understanding of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules but also reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This advancement could significantly contribute to the fields of genetic studies, drug repurposing, and the clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and progression. Addressing this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Further validation using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER in elucidating the complex interplay of genes, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and paving the way for therapeutic innovation and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide association studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet that remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER in elucidating complex gene interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and paving the way for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Despite the insights gained from transcriptome-wide association studies on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression, a facet that remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER in elucidating complex gene interactions, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and paving the way for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "While genes operate synergistically in specific contexts to execute their functions, understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This understanding is pivotal for the development of new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and progression. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Further, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation indicates that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the potential of PhenoPLIER in elucidating the complex interplay of genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby advancing the field of functional genomics and paving the way for targeted therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact and influence complex traits is crucial, particularly in the context of disease origin and progression. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal. However, a gap exists in our ability to effectively map these interactions and their implications for disease and drug mechanisms. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that while some functionally important players lack associations, they are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only enhance our understanding of disease etiology but also provide a novel approach for identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."
