          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to

          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions,
          necessitating a comprehensive understanding of gene expression
          regulation across various conditions for elucidating the influence of
          these genes on complex traits. Such insights are crucial for
          developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have indeed contributed significantly to identifying
          individual genes involved in disease mechanisms; however, contemporary
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in
          the onset and progression of diseases.


          To address this, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy
          integrating genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          framework is built on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
          patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases
          exhibit significant association with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs while deducing their mechanisms of action.


          Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation analysis, we identify key functional elements lacking
          explicit genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our approach offers novel perspectives on
          genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes and
          unearthing potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked using
          single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER presents a groundbreaking
          framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene
          modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have long been focused on understanding the role of
          individual genes in complex traits and disease mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable
          insights, they may overlook gene-gene interactions that play a crucial
          role in disease origin and progression. This gap limits our ability to
          fully understand how genetic associations influence complex traits and
          identify potential therapeutic targets. To address this limitation, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions,
          revealing disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations, accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action that may be missed
          by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our approach provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, advancing our understanding of complex traits and
          disease etiology while also identifying potential therapeutic targets
          for drug repurposing.

          Genetic studies have shown that genes collaborate with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. To understand how these
          genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to gain insight into the
          mechanisms of expression regulation across different conditions. This
          knowledge is essential for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes involved in disease-relevant processes. However, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the
          onset and progression of diseases. 


          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important
          players lacking associations can be prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative
          approach provides a new framework for interpreting genetic

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have been crucial in understanding the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, there is a
          gap in the literature regarding how gene-gene interactions contribute
          to complex trait architecture and disease origin. This missing
          information hinders the development of new therapies that can target
          these interactions effectively. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
          identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          conditions to uncover trait-associated gene clusters. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs
          and mechanisms of action. Additionally, PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important players lacking genetic associations but
          identified through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In
          conclusion, incorporating co-expressed genes using our approach
          provides contextualized genetic associations that can reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting gene expression
          patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
          progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across the same conditions. Our results show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players lacking associations were prioritized by PhenoPLIER
          within trait-associated modules. In summary, incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes into genetic association analysis provides new
          insights into potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
          associations but identified as trait-associated by single-gene
          strategies. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by traditional approaches. Our work
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which may help advance the
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach presented in this study,
          combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. The intricate
          functions of genes are often context-dependent, necessitating an
          understanding of their expression regulation across different
          conditions to determine their impact on complex traits.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly
          to our knowledge of individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms;
          however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER
          employs modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns
          across shared conditions as its representation basis. We found that
          these modules are strongly associated with diseases when expressed in
          relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions for known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrated
          PhenoPLIER's ability to prioritize functionally important genes
          lacking direct associations but present within trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, by integrating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. This
          innovative framework offers fresh insights into interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating disease
          etiology understanding and drug repurposing efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The field of genetic studies has long been interested in understanding
          the mechanisms behind complex traits and diseases. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          gene contributions, the importance of gene-gene interactions remains
          elusive. This gap is critical as modern models predict that these
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
          identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often work in
          concert to perform specific functions under different conditions.
          Understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying this coordinated
          expression is critical for developing new therapies. Although
          transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes implicated in disease processes, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait origins
          and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with these modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, enabling accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs
          and inference of mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can identify
          functionally important targets missed by single-gene strategies. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a framework to interpret genetic

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the study of complex traits and disease etiology, there is a need
          to understand gene-gene interactions that contribute to these
          processes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover individual genes' roles in diseases, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play crucial roles in complex trait
          architecture. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis.


          PhenoPLIER is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules and can reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach offers a new
          perspective on complex trait architecture and disease etiology,
          contributing to advancing our understanding of these processes.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding the
          influence of genes on complex traits requires insight into their
          coordinated expression regulation across different conditions.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin

          with similar patterns under shared conditions. We observe significant
          associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs' mechanisms of action, as well as inferring novel
          ones. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally important yet unassociated players prioritized by
          PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed gene
          groups and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on

          Context: The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, as
          genes act in concert with each other. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play crucial roles in disease origin and progression. However,
          identifying these interactions remains challenging due to limited
          computational approaches available for joint analysis.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly

          lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
          trait-associated modules.


          Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of
          co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework provides a valuable tool for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our
          understanding of complex traits and potentially enabling drug
          repurposing or identification of new therapeutic targets.

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often function
          together in specific contexts to fulfill their roles. Understanding
          how these genes contribute to complex traits requires knowledge of
          expression regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding is
          crucial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual gene
          contributions to disease mechanisms, but models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant
          role in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation
          utilizes modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns across
          shared conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly linked
          to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, we find through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          that functionally important yet unassociated players can be
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In summary,
          PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the
          contextualization of genetic associations to uncover potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel
          framework provides insights into interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding the role that
          individual genes play in complex traits and diseases has been a
          central focus. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the function of single genes, there is a gap in our
          knowledge regarding gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease
          etiology and progression. This missing link between genetic
          associations and biological mechanisms hinders the development of
          effective therapeutic targets. 


          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to
          contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
          Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene

          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. 


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies but also provides a new perspective on
          interpreting genetic associations and their role in disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms. This innovative approach moves the field forward
          by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in
          understanding complex traits and identifying therapeutic targets for
          repurposing existing drugs or developing novel treatments.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genetic
          interactions are critical in the origin and progression of complex
          traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified
          disease-relevant genes, modern models emphasize the importance of
          gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed
          genes across conditions relevant to specific diseases or cell types.
          Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates mechanisms of action. In a case study on lipid regulation
          using CRISPR screens, we find that functionally important but
          unassociated genes are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our method offers a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
          co-expression patterns, revealing potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.

          In the study of complex traits and diseases, it is essential to

          representation for joint analysis. This method leverages modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to
          uncover insights missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by traditional
          approaches. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action using a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides
          a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and providing
          insights into potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

          Genes function in unison to perform their functions within specific
          contexts. Achieving a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions is essential for determining
          how these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies.
          This study presents evidence that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screens to analyze
          lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking
          direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This innovative approach
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, it is crucial to understand how
          genes work together in specific contexts to influence complex traits.
          This insight into expression regulation across different conditions is
          critical for developing new therapies. However, there has been a gap
          in the literature regarding an effective approach to predict
          drug-disease associations and mechanisms of action. Our study aims to
          address this gap by presenting PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
          contextualizes genetic associations through gene modules.


          Here we show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types using PhenoPLIER.
          Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
          players lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through
          PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions, revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our study moves the field forward by
          providing a framework that interprets genetic associations through the
          lens of gene modules and highlights their broader significance in
          developing new therapies for complex diseases.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          The study of complex traits has been hampered by our limited
          understanding of how genes interact with each other to perform their
          functions in different contexts. This knowledge is crucial for the
          development of new therapeutic strategies, as it provides insight into
          gene expression regulation across various conditions. To address this
          gap, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which incorporates
          groups of co-expressed genes to provide a more comprehensive
          understanding of genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          that are missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that
          diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We also
          demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important players
          lacking genetic associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our study highlights how
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential therapeutic targets for disease treatment.

          Genes function collectively in specific contexts, necessitating a
          comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions to elucidate their influence on complex traits. This
          knowledge is crucial for the development of new therapeutic
          interventions. Our study demonstrates that diseases exhibit
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types and validates our approach by accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations but
          prioritized within trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene expression patterns, providing insights into disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms.

          Context: Understanding how genes function in concert to influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies, but a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions remains elusive. This gap in knowledge hinders the
          identification of therapeutic targets and limits our ability to
          predict drug mechanisms.


          Content: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations. We show that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations can be prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the potential for PhenoPLIER to
          reveal therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and
          provide new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          this framework offers a valuable tool for advancing our understanding
          of complex traits and informing precision medicine approaches.

          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          The complex interplay of genes in diverse contexts is vital for their
          proper function. Understanding the regulation of gene expression
          across varying conditions is crucial to elucidate how these genes
          contribute to complex traits, which is essential for developing new
          therapeutic interventions. Our research demonstrates that diseases
          exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and confirms the accuracy of our approach in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and deducing their mechanisms of
          action. In addition, utilizing CRISPR screens to analyze lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players lacking
          genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. Consequently, integrating co-expressed gene groups
          enables PhenoPLIER to provide a novel context for interpreting genetic
          associations and unmask potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative
          framework that facilitates the understanding of genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
          specific contexts, and understanding how these genes regulate
          expression across different conditions is crucial for developing new
          therapies. However, current methods often focus on single-gene
          associations, missing potential targets that could be revealed through
          a more comprehensive approach. This study aims to fill this gap by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis of
          genetic associations.


          We used PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that contextualizes genetic
          associations through gene modules, and found that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and
          inferred mechanisms of action, while prioritizing functionally
          important players lacking direct associations using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation.


          Our results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER to reveal targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive
          understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic targets. By
          incorporating gene modules into genetic association studies, we can
          move beyond traditional approaches and gain new insights into complex
          traits and their underlying mechanisms.

          Genes play a crucial role in various biological processes and can
          influence complex traits through their coordinated action. To
          understand the mechanisms behind these associations, it is important
          to investigate gene expression regulation across different conditions.
          Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with
          specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We have
          developed an approach that accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we employed a

          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in

          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, even when functionally important players lack direct genetic
          associations. We further validate our approach using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Our study not
          only fills an important gap in current literature but also highlights
          potential targets that can be explored for drug repurposing and
          therapeutic target identification, thus contributing significantly to
          advancing our understanding of disease etiology.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is
          important to have a clear understanding of the regulation of gene
          expression across different conditions. This knowledge is essential
          for developing new treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role individual genes play in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that interactions between
          genes are critical factors in the development and progression of
          complex traits. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases have
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          to study lipid regulation, we identify important functional players
          lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The complex traits are influenced by the interplay of genes in
          specific contexts, which requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          identified individual disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, prioritizes
          functionally important players lacking associations in lipid
          regulation CRISPR screens, and identifies disease association with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER fills a
          critical gap by providing insights into gene co-expression patterns
          for understanding complex traits' etiology and developing targeted
          therapies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The genetic basis of complex traits is often determined by gene-gene
          interactions, which are crucial for understanding disease etiology and
          identifying therapeutic targets. Although transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided valuable insights into individual
          gene roles in diseases, they do not account for the functional
          interplay between genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data onto a common latent representation
          based on modules of co-expressed genes. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized
          by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for understanding the genetic
          basis of complex traits, identifying therapeutic targets and advancing
          our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the complex traits of living organisms, genes act together to
          perform their functions. Understanding how these genes regulate
          expression across different conditions is essential for developing new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
          individual gene involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          modern models indicate that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in diseases' origin and progression.


          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
          trait-associated modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Despite genes acting in concert to perform their functions,
          understanding the complex regulation of gene expression across
          different conditions is crucial for determining how they influence
          complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided insights into individual genes'
          roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and

          modules. This study highlights the potential for leveraging gene
          expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and therapeutic

          complex traits and paving the way for novel treatment strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact to
          influence complex traits is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene
          roles in disease mechanisms; however, predicting gene-gene
          interactions in diseases remains a challenge. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we
          identify functionally important players lacking associations
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. This study
          highlights the potential of this computational framework for disease
          etiology prediction and drug mechanism identification in complex
          traits, advancing therapeutic targets discovery and drug repurposing
          strategies.

          Genes function collectively in specific contexts, and understanding
          their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for
          elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual
          genes involved in disease processes; however, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease onset and
          progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method integrating
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of co-expressed genes under the same conditions.
          Our findings show significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deduces mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using CRISPR screening data on lipid regulation,
          we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important but
          unassociated genes within trait-associated modules.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have identified individual genes implicated in complex
          traits, but a comprehensive understanding of how these genes interact
          to influence trait development remains elusive. This knowledge is
          crucial for the discovery and validation of new therapeutic targets.
          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation. We demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with modules of co-expressed genes in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important but
          previously unassociated genes for complex trait regulation. Our
          findings suggest that gene co-expression patterns hold valuable
          information about disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions,
              necessitating a comprehensive understanding of gene expression
              regulation across various conditions for elucidating the influence
              of these genes on complex traits. Such insights are crucial for
              developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have indeed contributed significantly to identifying
              individual genes involved in disease mechanisms; however,
              contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an
              essential role in the onset and progression of diseases.


              To address this, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy
              integrating genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              framework is built on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings
              reveal that diseases exhibit significant association with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while deducing their
              mechanisms of action.


              Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation analysis, we identify key functional elements lacking
              explicit genetic associations but prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our approach offers novel
              perspectives on genetic associations by considering groups of
              co-expressed genes and unearthing potential therapeutic targets
              that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. Thus,
              PhenoPLIER presents a groundbreaking framework for interpreting
              genetic associations in the context of gene modules, shedding
              light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genetic studies have long been focused on understanding the role
              of individual genes in complex traits and disease mechanisms.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided
              valuable insights, they may overlook gene-gene interactions that
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap
              limits our ability to fully understand how genetic associations
              influence complex traits and identify potential therapeutic
              targets. To address this limitation, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions,
              revealing disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action
              that may be missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our
              approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our
              understanding of complex traits and disease etiology while also
              identifying potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

              Genetic studies have shown that genes collaborate with each other
              in specific contexts to perform their functions. To understand how
              these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to gain
              insight into the mechanisms of expression regulation across
              different conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant processes.
              However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in the onset and progression of diseases. 


              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
              functionally important players lacking associations can be
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This innovative approach provides a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genetic studies have been crucial in understanding the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, there is
              a gap in the literature regarding how gene-gene interactions
              contribute to complex trait architecture and disease origin. This
              missing information hinders the development of new therapies that
              can target these interactions effectively. To address this, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations into a common latent representation for
              joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions to uncover
              trait-associated gene clusters. We find that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important players lacking genetic associations but
              identified through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation.
              In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed genes using our approach
              provides contextualized genetic associations that can reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting gene
              expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
              specific contexts, requiring a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions for determining
              their influence. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap
              highlights the need to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes
              into genetic association analysis.


              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
              associations but present in trait-associated modules by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. By contextualizing genetic associations and revealing
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, this approach
              moves us closer to understanding disease etiology and identifying
              therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms;
              however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players
              lacking associations but identified as trait-associated by
              single-gene strategies. In conclusion, incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by traditional
              approaches. Our work provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which may
              help advance the understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach presented in this
              study, combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. The intricate functions of genes are often
              context-dependent, necessitating an understanding of their
              expression regulation across different conditions to determine
              their impact on complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have contributed significantly to our knowledge of
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in
              the origin and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER employs modules
              of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across
              shared conditions as its representation basis. We found that these
              modules are strongly associated with diseases when expressed in
              relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions for known
              drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrated
              PhenoPLIER's ability to prioritize functionally important genes
              lacking direct associations but present within trait-associated
              modules. In conclusion, by integrating co-expressed gene groups,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. This innovative framework offers fresh insights into
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, facilitating disease etiology understanding and drug
              repurposing efforts.

              The field of genetic studies has long been interested in

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify

              interactions remains elusive. This gap is critical as modern

            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes often work in concert to perform specific
              functions under different conditions. Understanding the regulatory
              mechanisms underlying this coordinated expression is critical for
              developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association
              studies have identified individual genes implicated in disease
              processes, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in complex trait origins and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
              significantly associated with these modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, enabling accurate prediction of known drug-disease
              pairs and inference of mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              can identify functionally important targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a framework to
              interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
              highlighting disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

              In the study of complex traits and disease etiology, there is a
              need to understand gene-gene interactions that contribute to these
              processes. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover individual genes' roles in diseases, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play crucial roles in complex
              trait architecture. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis.

              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known

              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules and can reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach offers a new perspective on complex trait
              architecture and disease etiology, contributing to advancing our
              understanding of these processes.

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Context: The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions, as genes act in concert with each other. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play crucial roles in disease origin and
              progression. However, identifying these interactions remains
              challenging due to limited computational approaches available for
              joint analysis.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, making our approach accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              identify functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.


              Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of
              co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often
              function together in specific contexts to fulfill their roles.
              Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits
              requires knowledge of expression regulation across diverse
              conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of
              novel therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have identified individual gene contributions to disease
              mechanisms, but models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology
              and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation utilizes modules of
              co-expressed genes with similar patterns across shared conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, we find through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation that functionally important yet unassociated players
              can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.
              In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups
              enables the contextualization of genetic associations to uncover
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. This novel framework provides insights into
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules.

              In the field of genetic studies, understanding the role that
              individual genes play in complex traits and diseases has been a
              central focus. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the function of single genes, there is a gap in our
              knowledge regarding gene-gene interactions and their impact on
              disease etiology and progression. This missing link between
              genetic associations and biological mechanisms hinders the
              development of effective therapeutic targets. 


              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              novel framework to contextualize genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking genetic
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. 


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies but also provides a new
              perspective on interpreting genetic associations and their role in
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This innovative approach
              moves the field forward by highlighting the importance of gene
              co-expression patterns in understanding complex traits and
              identifying therapeutic targets for repurposing existing drugs or
              developing novel treatments.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genetic interactions are critical in the origin and
              progression of complex traits. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have identified disease-relevant genes, modern
              models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions.
              PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across
              conditions relevant to specific diseases or cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. In a case study on lipid
              regulation using CRISPR screens, we find that functionally
              important but unassociated genes are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our method offers
              a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene co-expression patterns, revealing potential

              associations have been studied extensively through
              transcriptome-wide association studies, there is a lack of
              understanding about gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
              progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions to uncover insights missed by
              single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by traditional approaches. We
              demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action using a
              CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology
              and providing insights into potential therapeutic targets for drug
              repurposing.

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              Genes function in unison to perform their functions within

              In the field of functional genomics, it is crucial to understand
              how genes work together in specific contexts to influence complex
              traits. This insight into expression regulation across different
              conditions is critical for developing new therapies. However,
              there has been a gap in the literature regarding an effective
              approach to predict drug-disease associations and mechanisms of
              action. Our study aims to address this gap by presenting
              PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that contextualizes genetic
              associations through gene modules.


              Here we show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types using PhenoPLIER.
              Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease

              The study of complex traits has been hampered by our limited
              understanding of how genes interact with each other to perform
              their functions in different contexts. This knowledge is crucial
              for the development of new therapeutic strategies, as it provides
              insight into gene expression regulation across various conditions.
              To address this gap, we present a novel approach called
              PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to
              provide a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets that are missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results show that diseases have significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. We also demonstrate the
              utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, where we find that functionally important players
              lacking genetic associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our study highlights how
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential therapeutic targets for disease treatment.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes function collectively in specific contexts, necessitating a
              comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              various conditions to elucidate their influence on complex traits.
              This knowledge is crucial for the development of new therapeutic
              interventions. Our study demonstrates that diseases exhibit
              significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and validates our approach by accurately predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we
              identify functionally important players lacking direct genetic
              associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules via
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting

              Context: Understanding how genes function in concert to influence
              complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies, but a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions remains elusive. This gap in knowledge
              hinders the identification of therapeutic targets and limits our
              ability to predict drug mechanisms.


              Content: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
              associations. We show that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lacking associations can be prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the potential for PhenoPLIER
              to reveal therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and
              provide new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, this framework offers a valuable tool for advancing our
              understanding of complex traits and informing precision medicine
              approaches.

              The complex interplay of genes in diverse contexts is vital for
              their proper function. Understanding the regulation of gene
              expression across varying conditions is crucial to elucidate how
              these genes contribute to complex traits, which is essential for
              developing new therapeutic interventions. Our research
              demonstrates that diseases exhibit significant associations with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and confirms the
              accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and deducing their mechanisms of action. In addition, utilizing
              CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation revealed that
              functionally important players lacking genetic associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Consequently, integrating co-expressed gene groups enables
              PhenoPLIER to provide a novel context for interpreting genetic
              associations and unmask potential therapeutic targets missed by

              Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
              specific contexts, and understanding how these genes regulate
              expression across different conditions is crucial for developing
              new therapies. However, current methods often focus on single-gene
              associations, missing potential targets that could be revealed
              through a more comprehensive approach. This study aims to fill
              this gap by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the
              analysis of genetic associations.


              We used PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that contextualizes genetic
              associations through gene modules, and found that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease
              pairs and inferred mechanisms of action, while prioritizing
              functionally important players lacking direct associations using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.


              Our results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER to reveal
              targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more
              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic
              targets. By incorporating gene modules into genetic association
              studies, we can move beyond traditional approaches and gain new
              insights into complex traits and their underlying mechanisms.

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Genes play a crucial role in various biological processes and can
              influence complex traits through their coordinated action. To
              understand the mechanisms behind these associations, it is
              important to investigate gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. Our study demonstrates that diseases are
              significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. We have developed an approach that accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we employed a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation
              analysis and identified functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations, revealing
              potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our findings suggest that the use of gene
              modules provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations and has significant implications in disease etiology
              and drug discovery.

              The complex traits of an organism are influenced by the
              coordinated action of genes in specific contexts. Understanding
              gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial
              for developing new therapies, yet this knowledge remains limited
              in certain areas of study. Our research aims to address this gap
              and explore how groups of co-expressed genes can provide a broader
              understanding of genetic associations related to diseases.


              Here we present our novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, even when functionally important
              players lack direct genetic associations. We further validate our
              approach using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. Our study not only fills an important gap in current
              literature but also highlights potential targets that can be
              explored for drug repurposing and therapeutic target
              identification, thus contributing significantly to advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To understand how these genes contribute to complex
              traits, it is important to have a clear understanding of the
              regulation of gene expression across different conditions. This
              knowledge is essential for developing new treatments.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role individual genes play in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              modern models suggest that interactions between genes are critical
              factors in the development and progression of complex traits. We
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that combines
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we identify
              important functional players lacking direct associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

              The complex traits are influenced by the interplay of genes in
              specific contexts, which requires a mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have identified individual disease-relevant mechanisms; however,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers
              mechanisms of action, prioritizes functionally important players
              lacking associations in lipid regulation CRISPR screens, and
              identifies disease association with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER fills a critical gap by providing
              insights into gene co-expression patterns for understanding
              complex traits' etiology and developing targeted therapies.

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions,
              and understanding the mechanisms of expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for elucidating how genes
              influence complex traits. This insight is critical for developing
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover individual gene contributions to disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene

              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on

              The genetic basis of complex traits is often determined by
              gene-gene interactions, which are crucial for understanding
              disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Although
              transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable

              In the complex traits of living organisms, genes act together to
              perform their functions. Understanding how these genes regulate
              expression across different conditions is essential for developing
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              revealed individual gene involvement in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models indicate that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in diseases' origin and
              progression.


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.

              Despite genes acting in concert to perform their functions,
              understanding the complex regulation of gene expression across
              different conditions is crucial for determining how they influence
              complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To understand how these genes contribute to complex
              traits, it is essential to have a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge
              is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide

              critical factors in disease origin and progression. We present

              the same conditions. Our results show that diseases have
              significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies important
              functional players lacking direct associations but prioritized
              within trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes function collectively in specific contexts, and
              understanding their expression regulation across different
              conditions is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying
              complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              identified individual genes involved in disease processes;
              however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              critical role in disease onset and progression. We present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method integrating gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of co-expressed genes under the same conditions.
              Our findings show significant associations between diseases and
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deduces
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screening data on
              lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important but unassociated genes within
              trait-associated modules.

              Genetic studies have identified individual genes implicated in
              complex traits, but a comprehensive understanding of how these
              genes interact to influence trait development remains elusive.
              This knowledge is crucial for the discovery and validation of new
              therapeutic targets. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with modules of co-expressed genes in relevant cell
              types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show that
              PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important but previously
              unassociated genes for complex trait regulation. Our findings
              suggest that gene co-expression patterns hold valuable information
              about disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.
