          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell

          lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of co-expressed
          genes contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. It provides a novel

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in

          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex

          developing a computational approach for mapping gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation.


          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, which maps genetic and pharmacological
          data onto modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation analysis, we find that functionally important
          players lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
          trait-associated modules.


          In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework provides a new avenue for interpreting genetic associations
          and advancing the understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is important to

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts, and
          understanding how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This
          knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in identifying the
          role individual genes play in disease-relevant mechanisms; however,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly
          contribute to disease etiology and progression. To address this gap,
          we present PhenoPLIER – a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built
          upon modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
          enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies have made significant strides in understanding the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions also play a crucial role.
          This gap highlights the need for a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions to determine how
          these genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies. Here
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. The representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, allowing us to observe significant disease association
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using CRISPR screen data, we found that
          functionally important players without direct genetic associations are
          prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing
          these associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This approach moves the field forward in
          understanding complex traits and developing new therapies.

          The study of gene function and regulation is critical to understanding

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The complex interplay of genes in specific contexts is crucial for
          their proper function. Understanding the regulation of gene expression
          across varying conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes
          influence complex traits and developing novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly
          to our knowledge of individual gene involvement in disease mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
          a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we
          present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          framework is built upon modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across shared conditions. Our results demonstrate strong
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, validating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally important players that lack direct genetic associations
          but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          summary, our approach offers a novel perspective on interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene groups,
          revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a fresh framework for
          understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Complex traits are influenced by gene interactions, which necessitates
          a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
          individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, their
          limitations highlight the need for an approach that captures gene-gene
          interactions in complex trait origin and progression. To address this
          gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, which maps genetic associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on co-expressed gene modules across conditions. This approach
          reveals significant disease association with relevant cell type
          expression patterns and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using lipid
          regulation analysis through CRISPR screening, we find that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important genes without associations in
          trait-associated modules. In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed
          gene groups allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
          providing a novel framework for interpreting these associations
          through the lens of gene expression patterns.

          This abstract presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          unites genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
          a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes
          function cooperatively in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions; hence understanding the regulation of gene expression
          across diverse conditions is essential for comprehending complex
          traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
          individual genes' involvement in disease mechanisms, but modern models
          of complex trait architecture emphasize that gene-gene interactions
          are crucial drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER
          represents these relationships through modules of co-expressed genes
          under the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit
          significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking
          genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations through gene co-expression patterns, revealing potential
          targets missed by single-gene approaches and offering a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene
          modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies have identified individual genes involved in
          disease-related mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in complex trait origins and
          progression. This gap motivates our work on PhenoPLIER, an approach
          mapping genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. To fill this
          gap, we introduce modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across conditions to represent disease-related mechanisms. Using
          PhenoPLIER's representations, we observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
          mechanisms of action. We further validate our approach by analyzing
          lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of co-expressed genes, potentially revealing targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This advances the field by offering
          new insights into complex trait origins and progression through gene
          module analysis.

          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach introduced in this
          manuscript, integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. By capturing the concerted action of genes across various
          conditions, PhenoPLIER offers mechanistic insights crucial to
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern
          models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in complex
          trait origin and progression. Leveraging modules of co-expressed genes
          with similar expression patterns under identical conditions,
          PhenoPLIER uncovers significant associations between diseases and
          cell-type specific gene modules. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies
          functionally important players lacking single-gene associations by
          prioritizing them within trait-associated modules. By incorporating
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          unveils potential therapeutic targets overlooked by conventional
          strategies. In summary, this study presents PhenoPLIER as a novel
          framework for interpreting gene module-based genetic associations to
          aid in disease etiology understanding and drug development.

          The architecture of complex traits is influenced by both individual
          gene effects and gene-gene interactions, which are crucial for disease
          origin and progression. Despite the success of transcriptome-wide
          association studies in identifying genes involved in disease
          mechanisms, there remains a gap in understanding how these genes
          interact to influence complex traits across different conditions. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, which allows us to prioritize functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules. We demonstrate the
          accuracy of our approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
          Our results highlight that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, emphasizing the
          importance of considering context when studying complex traits. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable tool for identifying
          potential therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of
          disease etiology.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation, enabling joint analysis. Genes work in concert
          under specific conditions to perform their functions. Understanding
          how these genes contribute to complex traits requires knowledge of
          expression regulation across different contexts. This insight is
          crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene
          roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and
          progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is built upon modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We
          found that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that important functional players lacking associations were
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups allows PhenoPLIER
          to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent space for joint analysis. Genes operate in concert
          within specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits requires knowledge of expression
          regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for developing new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. Nonetheless, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture posit that gene-gene interactions play a
          critical role in disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          representation is grounded on modules of co-expressed genes across
          similar conditions. We observe significant associations between
          diseases and expression patterns of relevant cell types. Our approach
          demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for
          lipid regulation analysis, we discover that functionally important but
          unassociated players are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER enhances the context of genetic
          associations through co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential
          therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel
          framework offers a new perspective on interpreting genetic
          associations via gene module analysis.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of complex traits and their associated diseases has long
          been a focus in genetic research. However, current methods often fail
          to capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that contribute to
          these conditions. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By focusing on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, this method can
          provide new insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic
          targets. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and PhenoPLIER is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this approach offers a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and
          their associated diseases.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is necessary to
          comprehend the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across
          different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
          therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules using
          PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating co-expressed genes into
          groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies might miss.
          Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of complex traits and diseases requires a comprehensive
          understanding of the gene expression patterns across different
          conditions. However, current single-gene strategies often miss
          potential targets involved in these processes. This paper aims to
          address this gap by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and

          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and
          provide new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The
          broader significance of this work is its potential to advance the
          field of functional genomics and aid in the development of more

          Despite genes acting in concert with each other to perform their
          functions, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions is necessary for determining how these genes
          influence complex traits and developing new therapies. However, this
          insight has been lacking until now. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel approach that integrates groups of co-expressed genes to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which moves us closer towards
          developing new therapies and understanding complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The study of gene expression patterns is critical to understanding the
          mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However,
          determining how genes influence these traits requires a deeper
          mechanistic insight into their regulation across different conditions.
          In this context, our research aims to address the gap in knowledge
          regarding the role of co-expressed gene modules in genetic
          associations.


          To achieve this goal, we used PhenoPLIER, an approach that
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes and contextualizes genetic
          associations. Our results show that diseases are significantly

          Genetic studies have made significant contributions to understanding
          the etiology of diseases and identifying therapeutic targets. However,
          determining how genes influence complex traits in specific contexts
          remains a challenge. To address this gap, we propose an approach that
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential drug mechanisms. In our study, we
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          Genetic factors play a crucial role in the regulation of gene
          expression and contribute to complex traits. To gain mechanistic
          insights into this process, it is necessary to understand how genes
          influence each other across various conditions. Our study shows that
          diseases are significantly associated with specific modules of
          co-expressed genes in relevant cell types. We have developed an
          accurate approach for predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we utilized CRISPR screening
          to analyze lipid regulation and identified functionally important
          players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our method incorporates groups
          of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, revealing
          potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies. We provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which could potentially
          enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          The complex interplay of genes in different contexts is crucial for
          understanding their impact on human traits. However, existing methods
          often focus on single gene associations, which can overlook important
          functional relationships between genes. In this study, we aimed to
          address this gap by examining the role of co-expressed gene modules in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach utilized
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that contextualizes genetic associations
          through groups of co-expressed genes. We found that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and identified functionally
          important players prioritized by PhenoPLIER's trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides an innovative approach for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This study moves the field forward by demonstrating how
          functional genomics can be used to understand complex traits and
          inform drug discovery efforts.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in
          specific contexts. Determining how these gene interactions regulate
          expression across different conditions is crucial for understanding
          disease mechanisms and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have identified individual genes involved in
          disease processes, but models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
          a critical role in disease origin and progression. This paper
          addresses the gap in our understanding of complex trait regulation by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant
          conditions, revealing significant disease associations with these
          modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we use CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, finding that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized by
          PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. Overall, this study advances
          our understanding of complex trait regulation and highlights the
          potential for discovering novel therapeutic targets through gene
          co-expression analysis.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic associations play a crucial role in understanding complex
          traits, disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current
          transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual
          genes and do not account for the impact of gene-gene interactions on
          these processes. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes in
          specific conditions. Our approach allows us to analyze the influence
          of gene expression patterns on complex traits and identify novel
          therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. We demonstrate the accuracy
          and effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by using it to predict known
          drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          show that our method is capable of identifying functionally important
          genes in trait-associated modules even when they lack direct
          associations with disease or drug response. Overall, this study
          highlights the potential of gene co-expression analysis as a powerful
          tool for understanding complex traits and advancing therapeutic
          development.

          Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to carry out
          their functions. To understand the impact of these genes on complex
          traits, it is necessary to comprehend the mechanisms behind expression
          regulation across varying conditions. Such insight is crucial for
          developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related processes. However, current models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical part
          in both the onset and progression of diseases. Here we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data onto a shared latent
          representation for combined analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical
          conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant
          association with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and
          our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to study lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important
          elements lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Understanding the role of genes in complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          uncovered the role of individual genes, modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. However, there is no computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, which fills this gap by mapping these associations onto
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action, and functionally important players
          lacking associations can be prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of
          studying gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms and contribute to the broader field of functional genomics
          by providing a novel method for identifying potential therapeutic
          targets through drug repurposing.

          The abstract has been revised to enhance clarity, concision and
          scientific language:


          Genes cooperate in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the
          onset and progression of diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns in identical conditions. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found
          functionally important players without associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have shown that genes influence complex traits through
          their interactions with each other in specific contexts. However,
          understanding the mechanisms of expression regulation across different
          conditions is crucial for developing new therapies and filling the gap
          in current literature. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models predict a significant role for gene-gene interactions in
          complex trait architecture. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression

          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease

          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the broader
          significance of this novel method for understanding disease etiology
          and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

          Genes perform their functions by working together in specific
          contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, we
          need to study the regulation of gene expression across various
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
          progression. We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
          demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions of
          known drug-disease pairs and inferences about mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lacking direct associations
          are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the complex landscape of genetic studies, understanding how genes
          interact to influence diseases and traits remains a significant
          challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          identified individual gene contributions, modern models emphasize the
          importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER—a
          computational approach that combines gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data into a joint latent representation
          based on co-expressed gene modules. Our results demonstrate
          significant associations between diseases and module expression
          patterns in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known
          drug-disease relationships and mechanisms of action. Moreover, through
          the analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we show that
          PhenoPLIER can identify functionally important genes lacking direct
          associations, thus highlighting its potential for therapeutic target
          identification and drug repurposing strategies.

            improving the text of a manuscript with title '{{ title }}' and
            keywords '{{ keywords }}.' Revise the following abstract of this
            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions,
              and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
              and progression.


              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of
              co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. It provides a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the

              The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies.
              However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in complex traits' origin and progression. This study
              aims to address this gap by developing a computational approach
              for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation.


              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, which maps genetic and
              pharmacological data onto modules of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions. We show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis,
              we find that functionally important players lacking associations
              are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.


              In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This novel framework provides a new avenue for interpreting
              genetic associations and advancing the understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their

              Genetic studies have shown that individual genes play a crucial
              role in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, gene-gene
              interactions are also important for understanding complex traits
              and disease origin and progression. Our study addresses this gap
              by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Our study demonstrates that PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a valuable
              tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
              gene modules.

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts,
              and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying
              conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in
              identifying the role individual genes play in disease-relevant
              mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and
              progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER – a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is built
              upon modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lacking associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Thus,
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              The study of gene function and regulation is critical to
              understanding complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have provided insight into the role of individual genes in
              disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions also play a significant role. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              shared conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
              associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screening to analyze
              lipid regulation, we also observe that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within
              trait-associated modules. Our study demonstrates the value of
              incorporating co-expressed genes into genetic analyses and
              provides a novel framework for interpreting gene module-based
              disease etiology and therapeutic targets.

              The architecture of complex traits involves gene-gene interactions
              that are crucial in disease origin and progression. However,
              current transcriptome-wide association studies focus on individual
              genes' roles. This gap limits the development of new therapies.
              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across conditions. We show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes
              functionally important players lacking associations. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to interpret
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing

              The complex interplay of genes in specific contexts is crucial for
              their proper function. Understanding the regulation of gene
              expression across varying conditions is essential for elucidating
              how these genes influence complex traits and developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed
              significantly to our knowledge of individual gene involvement in
              disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This framework is built upon
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across shared
              conditions. Our results demonstrate strong associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              validating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
              direct genetic associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, our approach
              offers a novel perspective on interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
              PhenoPLIER provides a fresh framework for understanding complex
              traits and drug mechanisms.

              Complex traits are influenced by gene interactions, which
              necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in
              disease mechanisms; however, their limitations highlight the need
              for an approach that captures gene-gene interactions in complex
              trait origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce

              This abstract presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that unites genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive
              analysis. Genes function cooperatively in specific contexts to
              carry out their functions; hence understanding the regulation of
              gene expression across diverse conditions is essential for
              comprehending complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed individual genes' involvement in disease
              mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture
              emphasize that gene-gene interactions are crucial drivers of
              disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents these
              relationships through modules of co-expressed genes under the same
              conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant
              associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types,
              and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players
              lacking genetic associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations through gene co-expression
              patterns, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
              approaches and offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations in the context of gene modules.

              Genetic studies have identified individual genes involved in
              disease-related mechanisms, but modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait
              origins and progression. This gap motivates our work on
              PhenoPLIER, an approach mapping genetic associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              conditions to represent disease-related mechanisms. Using
              PhenoPLIER's representations, we observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
              mechanisms of action. We further validate our approach by

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection

              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach introduced in this
              manuscript, integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. By capturing the concerted action of genes across
              various conditions, PhenoPLIER offers mechanistic insights crucial
              to developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms,
              modern models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions
              in complex trait origin and progression. Leveraging modules of
              co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns under
              identical conditions, PhenoPLIER uncovers significant associations
              between diseases and cell-type specific gene modules. Our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of
              action, and identifies functionally important players lacking
              single-gene associations by prioritizing them within
              trait-associated modules. By incorporating co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and unveils
              potential therapeutic targets overlooked by conventional
              strategies. In summary, this study presents PhenoPLIER as a novel
              framework for interpreting gene module-based genetic associations
              to aid in disease etiology understanding and drug development.

              The architecture of complex traits is influenced by both
              individual gene effects and gene-gene interactions, which are
              crucial for disease origin and progression. Despite the success of
              transcriptome-wide association studies in identifying genes
              involved in disease mechanisms, there remains a gap in
              understanding how these genes interact to influence complex traits
              across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which allows us to prioritize functionally important
              players in trait-associated modules. We demonstrate the accuracy
              of our approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene

              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              emphasizing the importance of considering context when studying
              complex traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable tool
              for identifying potential therapeutic targets and advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation, enabling joint analysis. Genes work in
              concert under specific conditions to perform their functions.
              Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits
              requires knowledge of expression regulation across different
              contexts. This insight is crucial for the development of new
              therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms;
              however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              significantly influence disease origin and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is built upon modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We found
              that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered
              that important functional players lacking associations were
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups allows
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Thus,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent space for joint analysis. Genes operate in concert
              within specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding
              how these genes influence complex traits requires knowledge of
              expression regulation across diverse conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for developing new therapeutic
              approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              Nonetheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
              posit that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease
              initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
              grounded on modules of co-expressed genes across similar
              conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases
              and expression patterns of relevant cell types. Our approach
              demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
              for lipid regulation analysis, we discover that functionally
              important but unassociated players are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER
              enhances the context of genetic associations through co-expressed
              gene groups, revealing potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a new
              perspective on interpreting genetic associations via gene module
              analysis.

              The study of complex traits and their associated diseases has long
              been a focus in genetic research. However, current methods often
              fail to capture the intricate gene-gene interactions that
              contribute to these conditions. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER,
              a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By focusing on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, this
              method can provide new insights into disease mechanisms and
              potential therapeutic targets. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, this approach offers a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing a
              more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their
              associated diseases.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of

              The current state of the art in genetic studies is limited by an
              inability to capture gene-gene interactions that influence complex
              traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, modern

              disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is
              necessary to comprehend the regulatory mechanisms of gene
              expression across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial
              for developing new therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation, we identify functionally important

              The study of complex traits and diseases requires a comprehensive
              understanding of the gene expression patterns across different
              conditions. However, current single-gene strategies often miss
              potential targets involved in these processes. This paper aims to
              address this gap by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to
              contextualize genetic associations. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide new
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The broader
              significance of this work is its potential to advance the field of
              functional genomics and aid in the development of more effective
              therapies for complex diseases.

              Genes function together in specific contexts, and understanding
              how they influence complex traits requires knowledge of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for developing new therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

              important players lacking associations were prioritized by

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions.
              Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive comprehension of expression
              regulation across various conditions. This insight is essential
              for the development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              through CRISPR screening analysis of lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players lacking associations but

              The study of gene expression patterns is critical to understanding
              the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However,
              determining how genes influence these traits requires a deeper
              mechanistic insight into their regulation across different
              conditions. In this context, our research aims to address the gap
              in knowledge regarding the role of co-expressed gene modules in
              genetic associations.


              To achieve this goal, we used PhenoPLIER, an approach that
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes and contextualizes
              genetic associations. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
              important players lacking associations were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
              and can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              This study contributes to advancing our understanding of complex
              traits and diseases and highlights the importance of considering
              co-expressed genes in genetic studies.

              Genes function in concert under specific contexts, necessitating a
              comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              varying conditions to comprehend their impact on complex traits.
              This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation using CRISPR
              screens, we discovered functionally important players lacking
              associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules
              through PhenoPLIER. Therefore, incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene

              Genetic factors play a crucial role in the regulation of gene
              expression and contribute to complex traits. To gain mechanistic
              insights into this process, it is necessary to understand how
              genes influence each other across various conditions. Our study
              shows that diseases are significantly associated with specific
              modules of co-expressed genes in relevant cell types. We have
              developed an accurate approach for predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we utilized
              CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation and identified
              functionally important players lacking associations but
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, our method incorporates groups of co-expressed genes

              The complex interplay of genes in different contexts is crucial
              for understanding their impact on human traits. However, existing
              methods often focus on single gene associations, which can
              overlook important functional relationships between genes. In this
              study, we aimed to address this gap by examining the role of
              co-expressed gene modules in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              Our approach utilized PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
              contextualizes genetic associations through groups of co-expressed
              genes. We found that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and identified functionally important
              players prioritized by PhenoPLIER's trait-associated modules. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides an innovative approach for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. This study moves the field forward by
              demonstrating how functional genomics can be used to understand
              complex traits and inform drug discovery efforts.

              Complex traits are influenced by the concerted action of genes in

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their

              important players lacking associations can be prioritized within

              Genetic associations play a crucial role in understanding complex
              traits, disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current
              transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on
              individual genes and do not account for the impact of gene-gene
              interactions on these processes. In this paper, we aim to address
              this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation based on modules of
              co-expressed genes in specific conditions. Our approach allows us
              to analyze the influence of gene expression patterns on complex
              traits and identify novel therapeutic targets for drug
              repurposing. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of
              PhenoPLIER by using it to predict known drug-disease pairs and
              infer mechanisms of action. Additionally, we show that our method
              is capable of identifying functionally important genes in
              trait-associated modules even when they lack direct associations
              with disease or drug response. Overall, this study highlights the
              potential of gene co-expression analysis as a powerful tool for
              understanding complex traits and advancing therapeutic
              development.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              "broader significance").

              Genes operate synergistically within specific contexts to carry
              out their functions. To understand the impact of these genes on
              complex traits, it is necessary to comprehend the mechanisms
              behind expression regulation across varying conditions. Such
              insight is crucial for developing novel therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related
              processes. However, current models of complex trait architecture
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical part in both
              the onset and progression of diseases. Here we present PhenoPLIER,
              a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data onto a shared latent
              representation for combined analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases
              exhibit significant association with gene modules expressed in
              pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              discovered that functionally important elements lacking
              associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Understanding the role of genes in complex traits requires a

              scientific language:


              Genes cooperate in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
              Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing
              new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              identify individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              significantly contribute to the onset and progression of diseases.
              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns in identical conditions. Our findings indicate
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              found functionally important players without associations but
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genetic studies have shown that genes influence complex traits
              through their interactions with each other in specific contexts.
              However, understanding the mechanisms of expression regulation
              across different conditions is crucial for developing new
              therapies and filling the gap in current literature. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual
              gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict a

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes perform their functions by working together in specific
              contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              we need to study the regulation of gene expression across various
              conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
              the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical

              relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions of known
              drug-disease pairs and inferences about mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we

              associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated

              In the complex landscape of genetic studies, understanding how
              genes interact to influence diseases and traits remains a
              significant challenge. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have identified individual gene contributions, modern
              models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in
              disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we

              gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data
              into a joint latent representation based on co-expressed gene

              accurately predicting known drug-disease relationships and
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of lipid
              regulation using CRISPR screens, we show that PhenoPLIER can

              thus highlighting its potential for therapeutic target

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
