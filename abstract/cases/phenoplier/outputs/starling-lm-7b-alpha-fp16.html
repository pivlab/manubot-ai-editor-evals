 The study of gene expression patterns is crucial in understanding the mechanisms underlying complex traits and the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

 Genes interact in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these interactions influence complex traits requires a comprehensive analysis of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

 In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data is crucial for developing new therapies. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression, making it essential to study the expression regulation of genes across different conditions. Existing methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have focused on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action demonstrates its potential as a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a new perspective on understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms by highlighting the importance of gene expression patterns in complex traits.</td>

 We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts; understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for discovering novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, but contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions.

 Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific contexts, and comprehending how these genes influence complex traits necessitates understanding expression regulation across diverse circumstances. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease genesis and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with analogous expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally critical players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>

 The study of genes in complex traits requires a thorough understanding of their expression regulation across different conditions, as this knowledge is essential for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this context, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach fills the gap in current literature by focusing on gene-gene interactions and demonstrates its potential in enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

In this study, we address a critical gap in the field of complex traits by developing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our approach provides new insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits and contributes to the understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[PASS] (1.00)  Understanding the interplay of genes in specific contexts is essential for determining how they influence complex traits and informing the development of new therapies.
