          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must

        output: ' Genetic studies have provided key insights into disease etiology, but unraveling the complex interplay of genes and their products remains challenging. Gene co-expression patterns offer a powerful way to analyze these interactions and identify potential therapeutic targets. However, existing methods often focus on individual genes, which can miss crucial gene-gene interactions underlying disease mechanisms. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players that are not directly associated with traits. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes'' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER''s representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation reveals that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations but present in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

        output: ' The field of genetic studies has focused primarily on individual genes to identify their roles in disease and drug mechanisms. However, functional genomics research has demonstrated the importance of gene co-expression in understanding complex traits and potential therapeutic targets. Despite this knowledge gap, current approaches struggle to incorporate these insights into genetic association analyses. In response, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions to better understand disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results show that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms, highlighting the potential of co-expression-based analyses for drug repurposing. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER even if they lack known associations. Our findings suggest that incorporating gene co-expression patterns can enhance genetic association studies and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

However, current methods are limited by single-gene strategies that fail to capture these interactions. Our study aimed to address this gap by exploring the association between gene expression patterns and genetic associations in different cellular contexts. We utilized a novel approach called PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation through a CRISPR screen, which revealed functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows for the identification of potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' The study of genes in conjunction with one another is crucial to understanding their influence on complex traits, particularly for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with specific gene expression patterns in relevant cellular contexts, and that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack significant associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and identification of targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene module patterns.'

        output: ' The genetic basis of complex diseases and drug mechanisms remains elusive, partly due to the challenge of disentangling the interplay between genes in specific contexts. To address this gap, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene co-expression patterns across different conditions and cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we show that functionally important genes lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a framework to contextualize genetic associations through gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Understanding the combined action of genes is crucial for comprehending how they influence complex traits and contribute to disease. This mechanistic insight has significant implications for therapeutic development. In this study, we demonstrate that our method PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action by analyzing the expression patterns of gene modules across different conditions. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, shedding light on potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and contributing to the broader field of functional genomics.'

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' The study of genes in concert with each other in specific contexts is crucial for understanding their influence on complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are essential in disease origin and progression. Here, a computational approach named PhenoPLIER is introduced, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.'

        output: ' The genetic basis of complex traits is typically characterized by gene-gene interactions, which contribute to the etiology and progression of diseases. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been effective in uncovering individual genes'' roles in disease-related mechanisms, they fail to capture these interaction effects. This study aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The approach is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions and can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, it identifies functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, this study highlights the importance of gene co-expression networks in highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a methodological framework for future studies in functional genomics and therapeutic targets.'

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown

          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

            You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
            improving the text of a manuscript with title '{{ title }}' and
            keywords '{{ keywords }}.' Revise the following abstract of this
            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

            text: ' Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

            text: ' Genetic studies have provided key insights into disease etiology, but unraveling the complex interplay of genes and their products remains challenging. Gene co-expression patterns offer a powerful way to analyze these interactions and identify potential therapeutic targets. However, existing methods often focus on individual genes, which can miss crucial gene-gene interactions underlying disease mechanisms. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players that are not directly associated with traits. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

               Genetic studies have identified numerous trait-associated genes, but understanding the mechanisms through which these genes contribute to complex diseases remains a challenge. Modern models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We show that PhenoPLIER leverages the inherently functional relationship among co-expressed genes to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of action, and prioritize functionally important players in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with applications in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            text: ' The field of genetic studies has focused primarily on individual genes to identify their roles in disease and drug mechanisms. However, functional genomics research has demonstrated the importance of gene co-expression in understanding complex traits and potential therapeutic targets. Despite this knowledge gap, current approaches struggle to incorporate these insights into genetic association analyses. In response, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions to better understand disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results show that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring drug mechanisms, highlighting the potential of co-expression-based analyses for drug repurposing. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER even if they lack known associations. Our findings suggest that incorporating gene co-expression patterns can enhance genetic association studies and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological intervention data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. Genes frequently collaborate to perform their functions within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across diverse conditions, as this knowledge is vital for developing new treatments. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related processes, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in disease initiation and progression.

              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,

               The study of genes in conjunction with one another is crucial to understanding their influence on complex traits, particularly for the development of new therapeutic approaches. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with specific gene expression patterns in relevant cellular contexts, and that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack significant associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and identification of targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene module patterns.

Moreover, by employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

            text: ' The genetic basis of complex diseases and drug mechanisms remains elusive, partly due to the challenge of disentangling the interplay between genes in specific contexts. To address this gap, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene co-expression patterns across different conditions and cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we show that functionally important genes lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a framework to contextualize genetic associations through gene modules, enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

               Understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies and has been achieved in part by transcriptome-wide association studies that help uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules

              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

              PhenoPLIER.

               The study of genes in concert with each other in specific contexts is crucial for understanding their influence on complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are essential in disease origin and progression. Here, a computational approach named PhenoPLIER is introduced, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               The genetic basis of complex traits is typically characterized by gene-gene interactions, which contribute to the etiology and progression of diseases. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been effective in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, they fail to capture these interaction effects. This study aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The approach is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across conditions and can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, it identifies functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, this study highlights the importance of gene co-expression networks in highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a methodological framework for future studies in functional genomics and therapeutic targets.

            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to fulfill their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across different conditions. Such insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
