          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work in harmony with each other to perform specific functions in
          specific contexts. Understanding how genes influence complex traits
          requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
          therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          identify the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease origin and
          progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
          Our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing valuable
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Furthermore, our
          findings highlight the importance of functional genomics in
          identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex
          diseases.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The field of functional genomics has focused on understanding the
          mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but
          traditional methods have limitations in analyzing gene-gene
          interactions. The concept of gene co-expression has emerged as a
          promising approach to study complex traits, which involves determining
          how genes are regulated in specific contexts and work together to
          perform their functions. However, existing methods such as
          transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have limitations in
          identifying gene modules associated with complex traits and disease
          mechanisms.


          To address this gap, we developed a computational approach called
          PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our approach utilizes modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions to identify gene-trait
          associations associated with complex traits and disease mechanisms. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action.


          Furthermore, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation and identified functionally important players that lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. This
          highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes in interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
          modules, providing a novel framework for studying complex traits and
          disease mechanisms. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a promising approach to
          understanding how genes work together in specific contexts and
          identifies potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genes work in concert with each other to perform their functions
          within specific contexts. Uncovering how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a thorough understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This knowledge is essential for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease etiology and progression. We introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The field of genetic studies has been focused on understanding the
          complex interplay of genes and their expression patterns in disease
          pathogenesis. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual gene contributions to disease, recent models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological
          perturbation and trait associations. Our method identifies groups of
          co-expressed genes, which we call modules, and maps them onto latent
          representations to enable joint analysis. We demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This study provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Gene expression patterns are critical for understanding the mechanisms
          underlying complex traits, including disease etiology and drug
          responses. While genetic studies have helped identify single-gene
          associations with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
          challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions and shows that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, revealing potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          highlighting the importance of functional genomics in disease etiology
          and drug discovery.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Complex traits arise from interactions between multiple genes and
          environmental factors, making it difficult to identify individual
          genetic contributions to disease risk. Functional genomics studies
          have revealed the importance of gene co-expression in determining how
          genes interact with each other to regulate complex processes. However,
          most existing methods for identifying therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing focus on single genes or pathways, failing to account for
          the complexity of these interactions. In this manuscript, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. By identifying modules of
          co-expressed genes across different conditions, PhenoPLIER provides a
          new framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing
          potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action, allowing us to identify functionally important players that
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
          Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel tool for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can inform drug
          development and personalized medicine strategies.

          In order to understand the influence of genes on complex traits, it is

          The study of genes and their interactions is a crucial aspect of
          understanding complex traits and disease mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
          identifying individual gene associations with diseases, modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions are also important for disease
          origin and progression. This highlights the need for methods that can
          identify and analyze gene-trait associations across conditions and in
          different cell types. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene expression patterns into modules
          and uses them to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbations data. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results show that incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules. This study contributes to the field of functional
          genomics and gene co-expression analysis, which are essential for
          identifying new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes play a critical role in the development and progression of
          complex traits. However, determining how these genes interact with
          each other to influence disease mechanisms is challenging. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach utilizes
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions to map gene-trait associations. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally important
          players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study demonstrates that by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have long been used to uncover the genetic basis of
          diseases, but a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions is crucial for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets. Recent advances in functional genomics have shed
          light on the role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
          progression, highlighting the importance of considering groups of
          co-expressed genes when analyzing genetic associations. However,
          current methods struggle to incorporate this information effectively.
          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that

          The study of complex traits, such as diseases and disorders, involves
          the analysis of multiple genes and their interactions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant
          mechanisms, the current models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. To address
          this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, and observes that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results suggest that
          PhenoPLIER's representation can contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which could lead to the
          identification of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          opportunities.

          In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data to project genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns. Genes work together in specific contexts to
          perform their functions, and understanding how they influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions, which we observe are significantly associated with
          diseases in relevant cell types. We find that our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we reveal
          that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings
          suggest that by contextualizing genetic associations through groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and discovering potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our
          study highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provides a
          valuable tool for clustering complex traits and identifying potential
          drug repurposing targets.

          The manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The
          approach takes advantage of the fact that genes work together in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. To understand how these
          genes influence complex traits, it is necessary to have a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          Recent studies have shown that this insight is crucial for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease
          origin and progression. The PhenoPLIER representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          allowing for contextualization and the discovery of potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to
          identify functional modules for joint analysis. Our approach
          recognizes the importance of genes acting in concert with each other
          to perform their functions in specific contexts, highlighting the need
          for understanding expression regulation across different conditions to
          uncover the role of individual genes in complex traits. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying single-gene associations with disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes that show
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and our
          findings suggest that diseases are significantly associated with these
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, we demonstrate that using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation reveals functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          offering insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that may
          be missed by single-gene strategies.

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          The field of genetic studies has been advancing rapidly in recent
          years, but one major challenge is to identify the complex interplay
          between genes and disease mechanisms. To address this gap, we present
          a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. By leveraging gene
          co-expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER is able
          to identify disease-relevant modules of genes and predict known
          drug-disease pairs as well as infer mechanisms of action. In a case
          study using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings provide a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          have broader implications for drug discovery and therapeutic target
          identification. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data to create a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          method takes into account the complex interactions between genes in
          specific contexts, allowing for the identification of important
          expression regulation mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have previously
          identified the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes,
          but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in
          disease development and progression. Our approach utilizes modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and
          we find that diseases are significantly associated with these modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight
          the value of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in
          interpreting genetic associations, providing a novel framework for
          understanding complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets through functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis.
          Our approach has implications for drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and drug
          mechanisms.

          The current research aims to address the challenge of identifying
          functional and therapeutic targets in complex traits by leveraging
          gene expression patterns. The context of this paper is the field of
          genetic studies, which has been limited by the lack of a comprehensive
          understanding of how genes interact with each other across different
          conditions. This has hindered the development of new therapies for
          diseases that involve multiple genes and pathways. The specific gap in
          the literature that this paper addresses is the need for a
          computational approach to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis.


          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that uses gene
          modules with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types to
          contextualize genetic associations. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Our approach
          enables the discovery of potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies and highlights the importance of considering gene
          interactions in complex traits. By contextualizing genetic
          associations, PhenoPLIER can facilitate drug repurposing and
          clustering of complex traits, ultimately leading to more effective
          treatments for diseases involving multiple genes and pathways.

        output: >-

          Gene expression plays a crucial role in the development and
          progression of complex diseases. By examining gene co-expression
          patterns across different conditions, our study reveals significant
          associations between disease risk and specific modules of genes
          expressed in relevant cell types. This approach is highly accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms of
          action.


          To further explore the potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene studies, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation in cells. Our results show that functionally important
          players lack associations with disease risk but are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules. This highlights the importance of
          considering groups of co-expressed genes in understanding disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.


          Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can be applied to
          identify new therapeutic targets and repurpose existing drugs for
          complex diseases.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Complex traits are influenced by multiple genes and their interactions
          with each other, making it challenging to determine the underlying
          mechanisms. Functional genomics has emerged as a powerful tool to
          understand gene expression regulation in different contexts. However,
          existing methods lack the ability to incorporate groups of
          co-expressed genes, which can lead to missed targets and limited
          therapeutic potential. In this study, we developed a novel approach
          called PhenoPLIER that combines functional genomics with clustering
          algorithms to project genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and found that functionally important players lack
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and revealing
          potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules.

          The interplay of genes is essential for their function in specific
          contexts, and determining the influence of these genes on complex
          traits requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. Our study has demonstrated that this
          insight is critical for developing new therapeutics. Our findings
          indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, by utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack
          associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules
          using PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the integration of groups of
          co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations in the context of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic associations with complex traits are often difficult to
          understand due to the involvement of multiple genes in specific
          contexts. This complexity requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions, which has been
          shown to be critical for developing new therapies. To address this
          challenge, our study developed a novel approach that combines gene
          co-expression analysis with clustering techniques to identify
          disease-associated modules. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacking
          associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study highlights the importance of
          considering groups of co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic
          associations, which can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          Genetic studies have revealed associations between genetic variations
          and complex traits, but understanding the mechanisms underlying these
          relationships is crucial for developing new therapies. Functional
          genomics approaches, such as gene expression analysis and gene
          co-expression networks, have contributed to our knowledge of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, these methods often fail to
          capture the interplay between genes in specific contexts. In this
          study, we demonstrate that clustering genes based on their expression
          patterns highlights important features of complex traits.
          Specifically, we show that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, which can be used to
          predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We
          also analyzed lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, revealing that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the
          importance of incorporating gene expression patterns into genetic
          association studies, as it allows for a more comprehensive
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, opening up new avenues for
          therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

          The coordinated action of genes is critical for their proper
          functioning. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation in
          different contexts. Our study demonstrates that genetic associations
          with diseases can be accurately predicted by analyzing gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we show that our
          approach is effective in inferring drug mechanisms of action and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets. Utilizing a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation, we found that important players may not have

          PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          highlights the potential of functional genomics for drug repurposing
          and clustering complex traits.

          In the field of functional genomics, genes often act in concert with
          each other to perform their functions. However, understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This is critical for developing new therapies, as it has been shown
          that gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are significantly
          associated with diseases. In this study, we developed an approach
          called PhenoPLIER that accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes. We used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and found that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. This
          suggests that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
          provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance for
          drug discovery and personalized medicine.

          The interplay between genes in specific contexts is critical for their
          function. To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is
          essential to have a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. Our study demonstrates that this insight
          is crucial for developing new therapies by showing that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by contextualizing genetic associations
          through groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations and revealing
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have been crucial in identifying susceptible genes
          associated with complex diseases. However, understanding the
          mechanisms behind these associations has remained elusive. In this
          manuscript, we use functional genomics and gene co-expression to
          analyze disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We also show that
          functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings reveal the
          potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations,
          providing a novel framework for interpreting disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating
          gene expression patterns into genetic studies to gain a deeper
          understanding of complex diseases and identify potential therapeutic
          targets.

          Genetic studies have shown that individual genes contribute to complex
          traits and diseases. However, understanding the role of gene-gene
          interactions is critical for developing new therapies. Functional
          genomics has identified modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across different conditions, but determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and we find
          that disease risk is associated with modules of genes expressed in
          relevant cell types. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of gene modules and
          functional genomics in disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          making it essential to understand expression regulation across
          different conditions for uncovering disease-relevant mechanisms. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          discovering individual gene contributions to complex traits, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease etiology and progression. To address this challenge, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which enables us to identify disease-associated modules in
          relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs
          and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, we employed a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and observed that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings underscore the importance
          of functional genomics in identifying new therapeutic targets and
          repurposing drugs for complex traits.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics has uncovered a
          vast amount of information about how genes work in concert to perform
          their functions. However, determining the specific mechanisms by which
          these genes influence complex traits requires a deeper understanding
          of expression regulation across different conditions. Previous studies
          have shown that transcriptome-wide association studies can help
          identify individual genes associated with disease mechanisms. However,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease etiology and progression.


          To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, and we found that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          To validate our approach, we performed a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, and we found that functionally important players
          lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that our method can be used to identify
          key players and mechanisms of action in complex traits, which is
          critical for developing new therapies and repurposing existing drugs.

          Genetic studies have revealed the involvement of specific genes in
          various complex traits, including disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. However, it is challenging to understand how these genes
          act in concert with each other to influence these traits. A
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which helps us identify diseases associated with relevant

          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study
          highlights the importance of gene co-expression and clustering of
          complex traits in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a
          valuable tool for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies are essential for understanding disease mechanisms,
          drug targets, and drug repurposing. However, traditional gene-based
          approaches have limitations in identifying the complex interactions
          between genes that contribute to disease development and progression.
          To overcome this gap, functional genomics provides a powerful tool
          that allows us to investigate the expression patterns of genes across
          different conditions and identify potential therapeutic targets.


          To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to
          identify disease-relevant genes and mechanisms of action.


          We applied PhenoPLIER to transcriptome-wide association studies and
          observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicted
          known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action,
          highlighting the potential of PhenoPLIER for drug discovery and
          repurposing.


          To further validate our approach, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This result suggests that our approach can identify
          potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using
          traditional gene-based approaches.


          In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER
          in identifying disease-relevant genes and mechanisms of action, as
          well as predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms
          of action. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize drug
          discovery and repurposing by providing a novel way to identify complex
          gene interactions that contribute to disease development and
          progression.

          The study explores the role of gene expression patterns in identifying
          genetic associations and drug mechanisms related to complex traits.
          Using PhenoPLIER, a computational approach, the authors map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This is based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions.
          The results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important
          players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This study highlights the importance of gene
          expression patterns in understanding complex traits and developing new
          therapies. The findings also provide insights into drug repurposing
          and the mechanisms underlying disease etiology.

          Complex traits are the result of multiple gene-gene interactions, and
          determining how these genes work together is critical for developing
          effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

            improving the text of a manuscript with title '{{ title }}' and
            keywords '{{ keywords }}.' Revise the following abstract of this
            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes work in harmony with each other to perform specific
              functions in specific contexts. Understanding how genes influence
              complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge
              is crucial for developing new therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, recent models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play an essential role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules. Our approach can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, providing valuable insights into
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Furthermore, our findings
              highlight the importance of functional genomics in identifying
              therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex diseases.

              The field of functional genomics has focused on understanding the
              mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but
              traditional methods have limitations in analyzing gene-gene
              interactions. The concept of gene co-expression has emerged as a
              promising approach to study complex traits, which involves
              determining how genes are regulated in specific contexts and work
              together to perform their functions. However, existing methods
              such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have
              limitations in identifying gene modules associated with complex
              traits and disease mechanisms.


              To address this gap, we developed a computational approach called
              PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our approach utilizes modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions to identify
              gene-trait associations associated with complex traits and disease
              mechanisms. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action.


              Furthermore, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation and identified functionally important players that
              lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules. This highlights the importance of incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic associations through
              the lens of gene modules, providing a novel framework for studying
              complex traits and disease mechanisms. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers
              a promising approach to understanding how genes work together in
              specific contexts and identifies potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies.

              The field of genetic studies has been focused on understanding the
              complex interplay of genes and their expression patterns in
              disease pathogenesis. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on individual gene contributions to disease,
              recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical for
              disease progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene expression data with
              pharmacological perturbation and trait associations. Our method
              identifies groups of co-expressed genes, which we call modules,
              and maps them onto latent representations to enable joint
              analysis. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This study provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
              and highlights the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Gene expression patterns are critical for understanding the
              mechanisms underlying complex traits, including disease etiology
              and drug responses. While genetic studies have helped identify
              single-gene associations with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a

              Complex traits arise from interactions between multiple genes and
              environmental factors, making it difficult to identify individual
              genetic contributions to disease risk. Functional genomics studies
              have revealed the importance of gene co-expression in determining
              how genes interact with each other to regulate complex processes.
              However, most existing methods for identifying therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing focus on single genes or pathways, failing to
              account for the complexity of these interactions. In this
              manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. By identifying modules of co-expressed genes across
              different conditions, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
              contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action,
              allowing us to identify functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel tool for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which can inform
              drug development and personalized medicine strategies.

              In order to understand the influence of genes on complex traits,
              it is essential to comprehend how these genes regulate their
              expression across various contexts. The current study presents
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

              The study of genes and their interactions is a crucial aspect of
              understanding complex traits and disease mechanisms. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              identifying individual gene associations with diseases, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions are also important for
              disease origin and progression. This highlights the need for
              methods that can identify and analyze gene-trait associations
              across conditions and in different cell types. In this study, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene
              expression patterns into modules and uses them to analyze
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbations data. We
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results show that incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules. This study contributes to the
              field of functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis,
              which are essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and
              drug repurposing.

              Genetic studies have long been used to uncover the genetic basis
              of diseases, but a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions is crucial for identifying

              disease origin and progression, highlighting the importance of

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We propose PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. The regulation
              of expression across different conditions is critical to
              understanding how genes influence complex traits. However, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Our approach uses modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions to map gene-trait
              associations. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and found that functionally important players lacking
              associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our study shows that PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              The study of complex traits, such as diseases and disorders,
              involves the analysis of multiple genes and their interactions.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with
              disease-relevant mechanisms, the current models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology
              and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, and observes that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              results suggest that PhenoPLIER's representation can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, which could lead to the identification of new
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data to project genetic associations
              through gene expression patterns. Genes work together in specific
              contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how they
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. While

              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions

              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with

              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
              discovering potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene
              expression patterns in understanding disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, and provides a valuable tool for clustering complex
              traits and identifying potential drug repurposing targets.

              The manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. The approach takes advantage of the fact that genes work
              together in specific contexts to perform their functions. To
              understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
              necessary to have a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. Recent studies have shown
              that this insight is crucial for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression. The PhenoPLIER representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, allowing for contextualization and the discovery of
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              The current study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. The research highlights the importance of understanding
              how genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, particularly in complex traits. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
              individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms,
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. The PhenoPLIER approach
              identifies groups of co-expressed genes based on modules across
              the same conditions, allowing for contextualization of genetic
              associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. By using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              the researchers found that functionally important players lacked
              associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. The study concludes that PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, which is critical for developing new therapies
              and drug repurposing strategies.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to
              identify functional modules for joint analysis. Our approach
              recognizes the importance of genes acting in concert with each

              highlighting the need for understanding expression regulation
              across different conditions to uncover the role of individual

              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes that show

              leveraging gene co-expression patterns across different

              modules of genes and predict known drug-disease pairs as well as
              infer mechanisms of action. In a case study using a CRISPR screen

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to create a common latent representation for
              joint analysis. This method takes into account the complex
              interactions between genes in specific contexts, allowing for the
              identification of important expression regulation mechanisms
              underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have previously identified
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes, but
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in
              disease development and progression. Our approach utilizes modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, and we find that diseases are significantly associated
              with these modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we observe that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the value of incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic associations,
              providing a novel framework for understanding complex traits and
              identifying potential therapeutic targets through functional
              genomics and gene co-expression analysis. Our approach has
              implications for drug repurposing and clustering of complex
              traits, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and drug
              mechanisms.

              The current research aims to address the challenge of identifying
              functional and therapeutic targets in complex traits by leveraging
              gene expression patterns. The context of this paper is the field
              of genetic studies, which has been limited by the lack of a
              comprehensive understanding of how genes interact with each other
              across different conditions. This has hindered the development of
              new therapies for diseases that involve multiple genes and
              pathways. The specific gap in the literature that this paper
              addresses is the need for a computational approach to map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis.


              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that uses gene
              modules with similar expression patterns across relevant cell
              types to contextualize genetic associations. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              found that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. Our approach enables the discovery of potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies and highlights the importance of
              considering gene interactions in complex traits. By
              contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER can facilitate
              drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits, ultimately
              leading to more effective treatments for diseases involving
              multiple genes and pathways.

              Gene expression plays a crucial role in the development and
              progression of complex diseases. By examining gene co-expression
              patterns across different conditions, our study reveals
              significant associations between disease risk and specific modules
              of genes expressed in relevant cell types. This approach is highly
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              their mechanisms of action.


              To further explore the potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene studies, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation in cells. Our results show that functionally important
              players lack associations with disease risk but are prioritized
              within trait-associated modules. This highlights the importance of
              considering groups of co-expressed genes in understanding disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.


              Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which can be
              applied to identify new therapeutic targets and repurpose existing
              drugs for complex diseases.

              Complex traits are influenced by multiple genes and their
              interactions with each other, making it challenging to determine
              the underlying mechanisms. Functional genomics has emerged as a
              powerful tool to understand gene expression regulation in
              different contexts. However, existing methods lack the ability to
              incorporate groups of co-expressed genes, which can lead to missed
              targets and limited therapeutic potential. In this study, we
              developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that combines
              functional genomics with clustering algorithms to project genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns. Our results show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and found that functionally important players lack associations
              but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in
              contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential drug
              targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

            show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              Genes operate in a coordinated manner to perform their functions.
              Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires

              Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated

              Genetic studies have revealed associations between genetic
              variations and complex traits, but understanding the mechanisms
              underlying these relationships is crucial for developing new
              therapies. Functional genomics approaches, such as gene expression
              analysis and gene co-expression networks, have contributed to our
              knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, these
              methods often fail to capture the interplay between genes in
              specific contexts. In this study, we demonstrate that clustering
              genes based on their expression patterns highlights important
              features of complex traits. Specifically, we show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, which can be used to predict known
              drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We also
              analyzed lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, revealing that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              results highlight the importance of incorporating gene expression
              patterns into genetic association studies, as it allows for a more
              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Our approach provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, opening up new avenues for therapeutic target discovery
              and drug repurposing.

              The coordinated action of genes is critical for their proper
              functioning. Understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation in different contexts. Our study demonstrates that
              genetic associations with diseases can be accurately predicted by
              analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, we show that our approach is effective in inferring
              drug mechanisms of action and identifying potential therapeutic
              targets. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found
              that important players may not have associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic

              The interplay between genes in specific contexts is critical for
              their function. To understand how genes influence complex traits,
              it is essential to have a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. Our study demonstrates
              that this insight is crucial for developing new therapies by
              showing that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              found that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by contextualizing genetic associations through groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations and revealing potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genetic studies have been crucial in identifying susceptible genes
              associated with complex diseases. However, understanding the
              mechanisms behind these associations has remained elusive. In this
              manuscript, we use functional genomics and gene co-expression to
              analyze disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. We also show that functionally important players
              lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings reveal the potential of
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations, providing a
              novel framework for interpreting disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Overall, our work highlights the importance of
              integrating gene expression patterns into genetic studies to gain
              a deeper understanding of complex diseases and identify potential
              therapeutic targets.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models
              of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              making it essential to understand expression regulation across
              different conditions for uncovering disease-relevant mechanisms.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in discovering individual gene contributions to
              complex traits, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. To

              In the field of genetic studies, functional genomics has uncovered
              a vast amount of information about how genes work in concert to
              perform their functions. However, determining the specific
              mechanisms by which these genes influence complex traits requires
              a deeper understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. Previous studies have shown that transcriptome-wide
              association studies can help identify individual genes associated
              with disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression.


              To address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, and we found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


              To validate our approach, we performed a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation, and we found that functionally important players
              lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that our method can be used
              to identify key players and mechanisms of action in complex
              traits, which is critical for developing new therapies and
              repurposing existing drugs.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

              Genetic studies have revealed the involvement of specific genes in
              various complex traits, including disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. However, it is challenging to understand how these
              genes act in concert with each other to influence these traits. A
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. In
              this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This

              expression patterns across the same conditions, which helps us
              identify diseases associated with relevant cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. We further validate our method using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall,
              our study highlights the importance of gene co-expression and

              mechanisms, providing a valuable tool for therapeutic target
              discovery and drug repurposing.

              Genetic studies are essential for understanding disease
              mechanisms, drug targets, and drug repurposing. However,
              traditional gene-based approaches have limitations in identifying
              the complex interactions between genes that contribute to disease
              development and progression. To overcome this gap, functional
              genomics provides a powerful tool that allows us to investigate
              the expression patterns of genes across different conditions and
              identify potential therapeutic targets.


              To address this challenge, we developed PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which allows us to identify disease-relevant genes and
              mechanisms of action.


              We applied PhenoPLIER to transcriptome-wide association studies
              and observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
              predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of
              action, highlighting the potential of PhenoPLIER for drug
              discovery and repurposing.


              To further validate our approach, we used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players lacked associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This result suggests that
              our approach can identify potential therapeutic targets that may
              have been overlooked using traditional gene-based approaches.


              In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of
              PhenoPLIER in identifying disease-relevant genes and mechanisms of
              action, as well as predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Our approach has the potential to
              revolutionize drug discovery and repurposing by providing a novel
              way to identify complex gene interactions that contribute to
              disease development and progression.

              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.
