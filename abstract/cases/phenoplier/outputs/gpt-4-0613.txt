          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,

          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence
          complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and progression.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and progression.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          revealed that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations, thereby unveiling potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies and advancing our understanding of genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
          contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          perspective of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
          functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset and progression.
          Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is predicated on modules of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of

          co-expressed genes, offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations, thereby unveiling potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies and advancing our understanding of genetic

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and disease
          mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and
          drug repurposing.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes function
          synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their
          influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
          of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
          modules.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and disease
          mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and
          drug repurposing.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes function
          synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their
          influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
          of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
          modules.

          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and disease
          mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and
          drug repurposing.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes function
          synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their
          influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
          of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
          modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and disease
          mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and
          drug repurposing.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes function
          synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their
          influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
          of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is
          vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
          screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by
          incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene
          modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence
          complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin and progression.
          However, a gap exists in our understanding of these interactions and
          their role in disease etiology. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across
          identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying therapeutic
          targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and disease
          mechanisms, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and
          drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
          the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial,
          yet challenging. This understanding is particularly vital for the
          development of new therapies, but current research lacks a
          comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic associations and
          identify potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to address this gap. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial,
          yet challenging. This understanding is particularly vital for the
          development of new therapies, but current research lacks a
          comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic associations and
          identify potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to address this gap. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
          the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial,
          yet challenging. This understanding is particularly vital for the
          development of new therapies, but current research lacks a
          comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic associations and
          identify potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to address this gap. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
          the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          and influence complex traits across different conditions is crucial,
          yet challenging. This understanding is particularly vital for the
          development of new therapies, but current research lacks a
          comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic associations and
          identify potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed
          genes to address this gap. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
          players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that
          may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
          revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
          their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes impact
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for
          the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in
          pertinent cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation,
          revealing that functionally significant players, although lacking
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus,
          PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development
          of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal
          in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions and their role in disease origin and progression, which
          is predicted to be crucial by modern models of complex trait
          architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach designed to bridge this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
          direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene
          interaction's role in disease progression but also highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          and advancing drug repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries
          of functional genomics.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development
          of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal
          in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions and their role in disease origin and progression, which
          is predicted to be crucial by modern models of complex trait
          architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach designed to bridge this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
          direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene
          interaction's role in disease progression but also highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          and advancing drug repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries
          of functional genomics.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions and their role in disease origin and progression, which
          is predicted to be crucial by modern models of complex trait
          architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach designed to bridge this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
          direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene
          interaction's role in disease progression but also highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          and advancing drug repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries
          of functional genomics.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development
          of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal
          in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions and their role in disease origin and progression, which
          is predicted to be crucial by modern models of complex trait
          architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach designed to bridge this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
          direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene
          interaction's role in disease progression but also highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          and advancing drug repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries
          of functional genomics.

          Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
          their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes
          impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development
          of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal
          in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is
          founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns
          under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
          although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
          understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
          disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association
          studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding of gene-gene
          interactions and their role in disease origin and progression, which
          is predicted to be crucial by modern models of complex trait
          architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach designed to bridge this gap. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results reveal significant associations between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
          demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
          direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene
          interaction's role in disease progression but also highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          and advancing drug repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries
          of functional genomics.

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the

            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes
              influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,

              that functionally important genes lack associations but are

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection

              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their

              Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
              varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development
              of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are integral to disease onset
              and progression. Addressing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that amalgamates gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              predicated on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations, thereby unveiling potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies and advancing our understanding of genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
              importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              approach could significantly advance our understanding of complex
              traits and disease mechanisms, paving the way for innovative
              therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
              importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              approach could significantly advance our understanding of complex
              traits and disease mechanisms, paving the way for innovative
              therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the perspective of gene modules.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes
              function synergistically within specific contexts, and
              understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying
              conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar
              expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a
              CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that
              functionally significant players, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed
              genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the perspective of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease origin
              and progression. However, a gap exists in our understanding of
              these interactions and their role in disease etiology. To address
              this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical
              conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation demonstrated that functionally important players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              approach to interpreting genetic associations, highlighting the
              importance of gene co-expression. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, it provides a more comprehensive view of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially identifying
              therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
              approach could significantly advance our understanding of complex
              traits and disease mechanisms, paving the way for innovative
              therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial, yet challenging. This understanding is particularly
              vital for the development of new therapies, but current research
              lacks a comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic
              associations and identify potential therapeutic targets. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to address this gap. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players, although
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant
              advancement in interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
              revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic
              studies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial, yet challenging. This understanding is particularly
              vital for the development of new therapies, but current research
              lacks a comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic
              associations and identify potential therapeutic targets. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to address this gap. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players, although
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant
              advancement in interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
              revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic
              studies.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases have significant associations with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to execute
              their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes
              impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is
              pivotal for the development of novel therapies. Our study
              demonstrates that diseases have significant associations with gene
              modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, our
              methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we utilized a CRISPR
              screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
              significant players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers an
              innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations through
              the perspective of gene modules.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact and influence complex traits across different conditions
              is crucial, yet challenging. This understanding is particularly
              vital for the development of new therapies, but current research
              lacks a comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic
              associations and identify potential therapeutic targets. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that
              incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to address this gap. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation, we found that functionally important players, although
              lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant
              advancement in interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could
              revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic
              studies.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these

              development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the
              development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of

              The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
              understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
              disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide
              association studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding
              of gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and
              progression, which is predicted to be crucial by modern models of
              complex trait architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach designed to bridge this gap.
              PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. Our results reveal
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of
              gene-gene interaction's role in disease progression but also
              highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying
              therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing efforts,
              thereby pushing the boundaries of functional genomics.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. Our results reveal
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of
              gene-gene interaction's role in disease progression but also
              highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying
              therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing efforts,
              thereby pushing the boundaries of functional genomics.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the
              development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
              understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
              disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide
              association studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding
              of gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and
              progression, which is predicted to be crucial by modern models of
              complex trait architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a

              Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform
              their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across varying conditions is essential to understand how these
              genes impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the
              development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role
              of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and
              progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of
              genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical
              conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players,
              although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The functional genomics field has made significant strides in
              understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and
              disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide
              association studies. However, a gap remains in our understanding
              of gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and
              progression, which is predicted to be crucial by modern models of
              complex trait architecture. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              novel computational approach designed to bridge this gap.
              PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. Our results reveal
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation
              demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of
              gene-gene interaction's role in disease progression but also
              highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying
              therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing efforts,
              thereby pushing the boundaries of functional genomics.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
