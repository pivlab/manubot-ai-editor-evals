Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": "Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires knowledge about expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": "Genetic studies have long been used to understand complex traits; however, understanding how genes interact with each other is crucial in developing new therapies and elucidating disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role individual genes play in various diseases. However, they fall short when it comes to capturing gene-gene interactions that contribute to complex trait architecture. This gap limits our ability to predict potential drug targets and therapeutic strategies for disease treatment.\n\nHere we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations with disease traits onto modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions. Our method integrates TWAS data with gene expression patterns to generate a common latent representation that enables joint analysis of the two datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach.\n\nIn conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns. Our method can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This new perspective on complex trait architecture has broader implications for drug repurposing and the development of targeted therapies for various diseases."

          "output": "The complex traits underlying many diseases result from interactions among multiple genes in different contexts. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual disease-related genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical to understanding these traits. This study aims to bridge this gap by contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene modules. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The resulting modules represent genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results show that disease-associated genes are significantly clustered in these modules, which accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER identifies functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In conclusion, our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by conventional methods."

PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised Paragraph: \n\nThe complex interactions between genes play an essential role in influencing various traits. Gaining insights into how these genes regulate expression across different conditions is critical to understanding their influence on disease progression and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have made significant contributions towards identifying individual gene roles; however, the importance of gene-gene interactions cannot be ignored. To address this gap in knowledge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps both genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method focuses on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized by this method. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic analysis allows for more context-specific results that reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thus providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and elucidating disease etiology."

Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": "We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits. Recent advances have demonstrated the critical role of this knowledge in therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have facilitated the identification of individual genes involved in disease etiology; however, modern models posit that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the onset and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's latent representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our analysis reveals significant associations between disease traits and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players with no direct genetic association but are implicated within trait-associated modules. In summary, by leveraging groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides valuable context to genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression patterns."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns across conditions as its foundation. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we discover functionally important genes lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to interpret genetic associations by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches and providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is essential to elucidate expression regulation mechanisms across various conditions. Recent studies have emphasized the significance of this insight in developing novel therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of individual gene involvement in disease-relevant processes; however, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in complex trait origins and progression. PhenoPLIER constructs its representation based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed specifically within relevant cell types, making our approach highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important but genetically unassociated genes are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene groups, potentially revealing missed targets and shedding new light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Our method considers modules of co-expressed genes to reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is essential to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying expression regulation across varying conditions. This understanding has been shown to be critical for developing novel therapeutic approaches. In this study, our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, through the incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Context: Genetic studies have traditionally focused on individual genes to understand complex traits, but it is becoming increasingly clear that genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical for developing new therapies. However, there has been a gap in our knowledge about how genetic associations can be projected through gene co-expression patterns.\n\nContent: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies to reveal disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

This insight is critical for developing new therapies; however, there is a gap in the literature on integrating genetic associations through gene modules and contextualizing them within functional genomics.\n\nContent: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Our CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, moving the broader field forward by facilitating therapeutic target identification and enabling drug repurposing for complex traits."

          "output": "The complex traits exhibited by humans often result from the coordinated interplay of multiple genes and their interactions within specific contexts. To better understand these intricate mechanisms underlying disease etiology, there is a pressing need for advanced analytical methods that can elucidate gene-trait associations in diverse conditions. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational framework designed to map genetic associations onto gene expression patterns across various cellular states and environments.\n\nPhenoPLIER integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data, providing a comprehensive view of disease origin and progression by revealing key gene-gene interactions that contribute to complex traits. By identifying modules of co-expressed genes that share similar expression profiles under distinct conditions, PhenoPLIER facilitates the joint analysis of genetic associations and pharmacological interventions.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly correlated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions for known drug-disease pairs and inferences about mechanisms of action. Moreover, PhenoPLIER highlights functionally important genes lacking direct associations but playing critical roles within trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the novel approach presented by PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in our understanding of complex traits and disease etiology. By revealing previously unexplored gene interactions and providing new insights into therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities, this computational framework has the potential to revolutionize future genetic studies and pave the way for more effective treatments."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "The complex interplay between genes and their interactions is crucial for understanding the etiology of diseases and developing effective therapies. Despite advancements in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions remains elusive. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression; however, these relationships are difficult to identify using current methods. This study aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates genetic associations with gene expression patterns for joint analysis. The method uses modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions as the basis for mapping disease traits and pharmacological perturbations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. This study provides valuable insights into disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets, highlighting the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies for advancing functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Genetic studies have shown that genes work together under specific conditions to fulfill their functions. Understanding how these genes regulate expression across different contexts is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant processes, but modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important but unassociated genes within trait-associated modules, highlighting its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs for disease treatment."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Genetic studies have long focused on identifying individual genes associated with disease risk and therapeutic response. However, the complex traits underlying many diseases involve intricate gene interactions that cannot be fully explained by single genetic associations. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association data with pharmacological perturbation information to map gene-trait relationships into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, enabling the identification of disease-associated genetic networks. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action by prioritizing functionally important players lacking direct associations but implicated in trait-associated modules. Leveraging a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can uncover novel gene co-expression patterns relevant to disease etiology, paving the way for more targeted therapeutic interventions and drug repurposing strategies."

          "output": "The complexity of genetic interactions makes it difficult to understand the functional role of genes and their influence on complex traits. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions, they fail to capture the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to study the combined impact of these genes on disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanism of action. Additionally, our analysis using a CRISPR screen reveals that important players lacking associations can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. This study highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies to better understand disease etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing, advancing the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine."

              "text": "Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires knowledge about expression regulation across different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role individual genes play in various diseases. However, they fall short when it comes to capturing gene-gene interactions that contribute to complex trait architecture. This gap limits our ability to predict potential drug targets and therapeutic strategies for disease treatment.\n\nHere we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations with disease traits onto modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions. Our method integrates TWAS data with gene expression patterns to generate a common latent representation that enables joint analysis of the two datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach.\n\nIn conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns. Our method can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This new perspective on complex trait architecture has broader implications for drug repurposing and the development of targeted therapies for various diseases.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "The complex traits underlying many diseases result from interactions among multiple genes in different contexts. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual disease-related genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical to understanding these traits. This study aims to bridge this gap by contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene modules. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The resulting modules represent genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results show that disease-associated genes are significantly clustered in these modules, which accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER identifies functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. In conclusion, our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by conventional methods.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

Gaining insights into how these genes regulate expression across different conditions is critical to understanding their influence on disease progression and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have made significant contributions towards identifying individual gene roles; however, the importance of gene-gene interactions cannot be ignored. To address this gap in knowledge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps both genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method focuses on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized by this method. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into genetic analysis allows for more context-specific results that reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thus providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and elucidating disease etiology.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Despite advances in transcriptome-wide association studies, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap in our understanding hampers the development of new therapies. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across conditions for joint analysis. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and advancing our understanding of complex traits and disease mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              "text": "Genetic studies have advanced our understanding of complex traits and diseases; however, most methods focus on individual genes rather than considering their interactions within functional networks. This gap has hindered progress in identifying therapeutic targets and disease mechanisms. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of co-expressed genes across conditions, enabling the identification of disease-relevant gene modules. Our results show significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In a lipid regulation study using CRISPR screening, we found that functionally important genes lacking direct associations are prioritized by our approach within trait-associated modules. Thus, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through gene module analysis, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework contributes to the broader field of functional genomics and drug repurposing by providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes often function together under specific conditions, making it crucial to understand their regulatory networks across various contexts to elucidate complex traits' mechanisms. This knowledge is vital for developing new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual gene contributions to disease processes; however, modern models of complex trait architecture emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns across conditions as its foundation. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we discover functionally important genes lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is essential to elucidate expression regulation mechanisms across various conditions. Recent studies have emphasized the significance of this insight in developing novel therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of individual gene involvement in disease-relevant processes; however, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in complex trait origins and progression. PhenoPLIER constructs its representation based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed specifically within relevant cell types, making our approach highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important but genetically unassociated genes are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

            "We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical for developing new therapies. However, there has been a gap in our knowledge about how genetic associations can be projected through gene co-expression patterns.\n\nContent: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies to reveal disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and pave the way for new therapeutic strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This insight is critical for developing new therapies; however, there is a gap in the literature on integrating genetic associations through gene modules and contextualizing them within functional genomics.\n\nContent: Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Our CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms, moving the broader field forward by facilitating therapeutic target identification and enabling drug repurposing for complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

To better understand these intricate mechanisms underlying disease etiology, there is a pressing need for advanced analytical methods that can elucidate gene-trait associations in diverse conditions. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational framework designed to map genetic associations onto gene expression patterns across various cellular states and environments.\n\nPhenoPLIER integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data, providing a comprehensive view of disease origin and progression by revealing key gene-gene interactions that contribute to complex traits. By identifying modules of co-expressed genes that share similar expression profiles under distinct conditions, PhenoPLIER facilitates the joint analysis of genetic associations and pharmacological interventions.\n\nOur findings demonstrate that diseases are strongly correlated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions for known drug-disease pairs and inferences about mechanisms of action. Moreover, PhenoPLIER highlights functionally important genes lacking direct associations but playing critical roles within trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, the novel approach presented by PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in our understanding of complex traits and disease etiology.

              "text": "Genetic studies have shown that genes influence complex traits through their coordinated expression patterns across different conditions. Understanding these gene interactions is crucial for developing new therapies and filling a gap in the current literature. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. These findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and provide insights into drug repurposing strategies through joint analysis of genetic association data with pharmacological perturbation responses.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "The complex interplay between genes and their interactions is crucial for understanding the etiology of diseases and developing effective therapies. Despite advancements in transcriptome-wide association studies, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across different conditions remains elusive. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression; however, these relationships are difficult to identify using current methods. This study aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates genetic associations with gene expression patterns for joint analysis. The method uses modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions as the basis for mapping disease traits and pharmacological perturbations. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. This study provides valuable insights into disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets, highlighting the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies for advancing functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

However, these models do not account for gene-gene interactions that are critical to understanding disease etiology and progression. This gap poses a challenge in developing targeted therapies based on genetic associations. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic data onto a common latent representation by identifying modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. Our analysis reveals significant gene module associations with diseases, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach provides a deeper understanding of disease etiology and offers new avenues for targeted therapeutic development.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene contributions, they fail to capture the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to study the combined impact of these genes on disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanism of action. Additionally, our analysis using a CRISPR screen reveals that important players lacking associations can be prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. This study highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies to better understand disease etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing, advancing the field of functional genomics and personalized medicine.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",
