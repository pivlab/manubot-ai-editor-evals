Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identify functionally important genes that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.

In the context of understanding the complex interplay between genes, traits, and pharmacological perturbations, this manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Through accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inference of mechanisms of action, this approach proves effective in uncovering valuable insights. Notably, our analysis using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic associations but also identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies. This study underscores the importance of understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, emphasizing the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is increasingly recognized that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression of complex traits. By bridging the gap between single-gene approaches and the complex architecture of traits, PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits requires a detailed understanding of how gene expression is regulated under various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are key in disease development and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. By considering co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes may not show direct associations but are highlighted in trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.

By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the utility of our approach in uncovering key players in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key in disease development and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our results show that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes without direct associations are highlighted in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, showcasing the potential of our method in uncovering key players in complex traits.
