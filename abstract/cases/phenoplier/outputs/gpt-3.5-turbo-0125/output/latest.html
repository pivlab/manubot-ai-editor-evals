Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

In the realm of computational biology, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions to elucidate their impact on complex traits. This insight is crucial for advancing the development of new therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture emphasize the pivotal role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is structured around modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with our approach proving accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we identify functionally important players that lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In essence, PhenoPLIER leverages groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets that may be overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies. This framework offers a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.

By capturing how genes work together in specific contexts to influence complex traits, PhenoPLIER offers a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions, crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease progression. PhenoPLIER&#39;s modular representation based on genes with similar expression patterns reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation highlights that functionally important players, lacking individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER&#39;s incorporation of co-expressed gene groups provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations, identifying potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, and advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Genes function in coordination with each other within specific contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are closely linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we observe that functionally significant players may not have direct associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

Genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation under various conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the involvement of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture indicate that interactions between genes are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease relationships and uncovering mechanisms of action. Additionally, by utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally significant players that lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. Our analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and demonstrates the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also paves the way for new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies in the field of genetic studies and functional genomics.
