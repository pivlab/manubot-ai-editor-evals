          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation under
          various conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development
          of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across
          specific conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are
          significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
          screen investigating lipid regulation, we identify functionally
          important genes that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that
          may be missed by individual gene approaches.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify
          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.
          This approach not only advances our understanding of disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms but also holds promise for therapeutic target
          identification and drug repurposing efforts.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,

          This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies, as
          highlighted by previous research. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease

          associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that may have
          been missed by conventional strategies.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation under
          varying conditions. It has been demonstrated that this understanding
          is crucial for the development of novel therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in revealing the
          involvement of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is constructed based on gene modules
          with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our
          findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
          direct associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can
          place genetic associations in context and uncover potential targets
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation under
          various conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development
          of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is constructed based on gene modules
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions.
          Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players may lack
          direct associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can place genetic associations into context and identify
          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits
          necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation under
          various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture indicate that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is constructed based on gene modules
          with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease associations while elucidating mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players that may not be
          directly associated but are highlighted within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these interactions influence complex traits is
          crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          are key to disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological data to identify shared gene
          expression patterns across different conditions. Our analysis reveals
          that diseases are linked to specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and uncovers potential mechanisms of
          action. In addition, by utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid
          regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes without
          direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a comprehensive view of genetic associations and identifies
          potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked using traditional
          single-gene approaches. This innovative approach not only enhances our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also has the
          potential to advance precision medicine by uncovering new therapeutic
          targets for complex diseases.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,

          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new

          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to
          carry out their functions, underscoring the importance of
          understanding how these interactions influence complex traits across
          diverse conditions. This mechanistic insight is crucial for the
          development of new therapies, as evidenced by transcriptome-wide
          association studies that have illuminated the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
          architecture emphasize the critical role of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology and progression.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the context of genetic studies and functional genomics, the
          manuscript 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on gene modules with similar expression patterns across various
          conditions, enabling the identification of disease-associated gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high
          accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
          mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate
          lipid regulation, the study reveals that functionally significant
          genes, while lacking direct associations, are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Through the incorporation of
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that may be
          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes function synergistically
          in specific contexts to carry out their roles, emphasizing the
          importance of understanding gene expression regulation across diverse
          conditions for deciphering complex traits. The manuscript highlights
          the critical role of gene-gene interactions in the origin and
          progression of diseases, underscoring the need for mechanistic
          insights to inform the development of novel therapies and advance the
          field of drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          In the field of computational biology, PhenoPLIER is introduced as a
          novel approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on gene
          modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across specific
          conditions. The study reveals that diseases are notably linked to gene
          modules expressed in pertinent cell types, with the approach
          demonstrating accuracy in predicting known drug-disease relationships
          and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through the
          analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, the research
          identifies functionally significant players that lack direct
          associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
          offers a contextualized view of genetic associations and uncovers
          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          The findings underscore the importance of understanding how genes
          collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          particularly in the context of complex traits. This mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions
          is crucial for the development of new therapeutic approaches. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture emphasize the pivotal role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and progression.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data through
          a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is built on gene modules with similar expression
          patterns under specific conditions. Our findings demonstrate that
          diseases are closely linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships while elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally significant players prioritized within trait-associated

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the context of genetic studies and functional genomics, the
          manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data through a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across various conditions, revealing significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          The approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
          investigate lipid regulation, the study identifies functionally
          important players prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, despite lacking individual associations. By leveraging
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. Genes function synergistically in specific
          contexts to execute their roles, necessitating a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This
          insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide
          association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait
          architecture emphasize the pivotal role of gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology and progression, underscoring the significance of
          understanding gene expression patterns in disease pathogenesis and
          drug mechanisms.

          In the field of computational biology, the manuscript introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data through a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed
          based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under
          the same conditions. The study reveals that diseases are significantly
          linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with the
          approach demonstrating accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
          and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, the application of
          a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation uncovers that
          functionally important genes, lacking individual associations, are
          prioritized within trait-associated modules identified by PhenoPLIER.
          By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER offers a means
          to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets
          that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. The findings
          underscore the collaborative nature of genes in specific contexts to
          carry out their functions, highlighting the importance of
          understanding gene expression regulation across diverse conditions for
          unraveling complex traits. Notably, this mechanistic insight is
          crucial for the development of new therapies, as demonstrated by
          transcriptome-wide association studies that have elucidated the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary

          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression,
          underscoring the significance of exploring such interactions in future
          research endeavors.

          of individual genes to disease mechanisms. However, emerging models of

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have advanced our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet there
          remains a gap in projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation through gene
          modules with similar expression patterns. We demonstrate that diseases
          are linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation,
          we identify functionally important genes prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging co-expressed
          gene groups, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and
          uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes
          operate in concert with one another in specific contexts,
          necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new
          therapies, as gene-gene interactions are predicted to play a pivotal
          role in disease origin and progression, surpassing the role of
          individual genes highlighted by transcriptome-wide association
          studies. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of gene
          expression patterns in elucidating disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, paving the way for the identification of therapeutic
          targets and drug repurposing strategies through the clustering of
          complex traits.

          In the context of understanding the genetic basis of complex traits
          and diseases, there is a need for computational approaches that can
          integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel method that maps these
          associations into a common latent representation by identifying
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions.
          Our analysis reveals that diseases are linked to gene modules

          known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Through
          a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important genes, which may be overlooked by single-gene strategies,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a
          comprehensive view of genetic associations and uncovers potential
          therapeutic targets. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry
          out their functions, highlighting the importance of understanding
          gene-gene interactions in complex traits. This mechanistic insight is
          crucial for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shown the significance of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms. However, modern models emphasize the role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease progression, underscoring the need
          for approaches like PhenoPLIER to advance our understanding of complex
          traits.

          Introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis. This
          representation is built on gene modules exhibiting similar expression
          patterns under specific conditions. Our findings demonstrate a
          significant correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known
          drug-disease relationships and elucidating underlying mechanisms of
          action. A CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation highlights that
          functionally important genes, although lacking direct associations,
          are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to
          carry out their functions, underscoring the importance of
          understanding their regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions.
          This mechanistic insight is crucial for the development of new
          therapies, as transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture emphasize the pivotal role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have advanced our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet gaps remain
          in connecting genetic associations with gene expression patterns. Here
          we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns. Our analysis reveals that diseases are linked to
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate
          prediction of known drug-disease pairs and inference of drug
          mechanisms. Through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we
          identify functionally important genes prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the power of incorporating
          co-expressed gene groups to uncover potential therapeutic targets
          missed by traditional single-gene strategies. This approach sheds
          light on the complex interplay of genes in specific contexts,
          essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing
          effective therapies. By elucidating gene-gene interactions and their
          role in disease progression, PhenoPLIER offers a valuable tool for
          uncovering new therapeutic avenues and advancing precision medicine.

          In the field of computational biology, the manuscript introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data through a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          specific conditions, revealing significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The
          approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
          and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR
          screen to investigate lipid regulation, the study identifies
          functionally important genes that lack individual associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. The findings highlight the collaborative nature of genes
          in specific contexts to execute their functions, emphasizing the
          importance of understanding gene expression regulation across diverse
          conditions to decipher complex traits. This mechanistic insight is
          crucial for the development of new therapies, as gene-gene
          interactions are predicted to play a pivotal role in disease onset and
          progression, surpassing the traditional focus on individual gene roles
          in disease mechanisms as revealed by transcriptome-wide association
          studies. The integration of PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for
          advancing our understanding of complex traits and accelerating the
          discovery of therapeutic targets.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is built on modules of genes exhibiting
          similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate a significant correlation between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. We show that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on
          lipid regulation, we identify functionally important genes that may be
          overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies but are highlighted
          by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. By leveraging
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets. Genes
          collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          emphasizing the importance of understanding their regulatory
          mechanisms across different conditions. This mechanistic insight is
          crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, contemporary models highlight the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in the onset and progression of complex traits.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, the
          manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
          identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          specific conditions, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts disease
          associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and
          elucidates mechanisms of action for known drug-disease pairs. Through
          a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, functionally important
          genes lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach, which incorporates co-expressed
          gene groups, provides a contextualized view of genetic associations
          and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. Understanding how genes collaborate in
          specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential for
          developing new therapies, as highlighted by the critical role of
          expression regulation in disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models emphasize the importance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression,
          underscoring the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across diverse conditions.

          In the context of understanding the complex interplay between genes,
          traits, and pharmacological perturbations, this manuscript introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological data into a shared latent
          representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across various conditions, PhenoPLIER
          reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Through accurate predictions of
          known drug-disease pairs and inference of mechanisms of action, this
          approach proves effective in uncovering valuable insights. Notably,
          our analysis using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation
          demonstrates that functionally important genes lacking individual
          associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER not
          only contextualizes genetic associations but also identifies potential
          targets that may be overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies.
          This study underscores the importance of understanding how genes
          collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          emphasizing the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene
          expression regulation across diverse conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is increasingly recognized
          that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset and progression
          of complex traits. By bridging the gap between single-gene approaches
          and the complex architecture of traits, PhenoPLIER offers a promising
          avenue for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and
          potential therapeutic targets.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed knowledge of expression regulation under various conditions.
          This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are key
          in disease etiology and progression. Our research shows that diseases
          are closely linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          and elucidates mechanisms of drug action. Additionally, our analysis
          using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          important genes may not show direct associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by our computational tool, PhenoPLIER.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a
          comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under various
          conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of novel
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex trait architecture emphasize the importance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. Our study
          reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, with our approach accurately
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
          action. Through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we
          identify functionally important players lacking associations but
          prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific
          conditions, enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations
          and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Our findings highlight the utility of PhenoPLIER in projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns, offering insights into
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms that can advance therapeutic
          target discovery and drug repurposing efforts.

          In the field of genetics, the interaction between genes in specific
          contexts is essential for understanding complex traits. To unravel how
          genes influence these traits, a detailed understanding of gene
          expression regulation across various conditions is necessary. This

          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a
          detailed comprehension of expression regulation under various
          conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of novel
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture emphasize the
          importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and

          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          with our approach accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
          screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally
          significant players that may lack direct associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. We introduce

          conditions, enabling PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific
          contexts to influence complex traits, highlighting the importance of
          understanding gene expression regulation across different conditions
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          are key in disease etiology and progression. Our research focuses on
          the association of diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and uncovering mechanisms of action. Through
          a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we identify functionally
          important genes prioritized in trait-associated modules by our
          computational tool, PhenoPLIER. This novel approach integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules,
          providing a comprehensive analysis that contextualizes genetic
          associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be
          overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies. Our findings not
          only advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          but also offer a promising avenue for drug repurposing and the
          identification of therapeutic targets through clustering of complex
          traits.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of expression regulation under different
          conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
          recognized that gene-gene interactions are crucial in the origin and
          progression of diseases. Our research shows that diseases are closely

          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation under
          various conditions. This mechanistic insight is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture emphasize the
          importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression. Our research demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our novel
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on
          lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our
          method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER, introduced here, is a computational
          tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across specific conditions, enabling
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
          targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This
          innovative approach not only fills a gap in current research by
          highlighting the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms but also provides a valuable tool for
          advancing functional genomics and drug discovery efforts.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes work together in
          specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential. While
          previous studies have focused on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, it is increasingly recognized that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial for disease development. To address this gap,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data to identify gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers
          mechanisms of action by prioritizing functionally important players
          within trait-associated modules. By analyzing lipid regulation using a
          CRISPR screen, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can identify potential
          targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies. By mapping gene
          expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER provides a
          comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits,

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of gene expression regulation under various
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are key to disease development and progression. Our

          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we
          have identified functionally important players that may not be
          associated with traits but are prioritized in trait-associated modules

          This representation is based on groups of co-expressed genes with
          similar expression patterns across various conditions. By
          incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER can provide context to
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets that may be
          overlooked by single-gene approaches.

          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a
          detailed comprehension of expression regulation under various
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new
          therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          and progression. Our research demonstrates a significant association
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          with our approach accurately predicting known drug-disease
          relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify
          functionally important players that lack direct associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for comprehensive analysis. This representation
          is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across
          specific conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. Our findings not only advance our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also pave
          the way for more effective therapeutic targeting strategies in the
          field of genetic studies and functional genomics.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a detailed understanding of gene expression regulation
          under different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture highlight the
          importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          progression. Our research shows that diseases are significantly linked
          to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms
          of action. Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation using a
          CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important genes lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER, our novel computational approach, integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. Our findings not only provide insights into
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also pave the way for more
          effective therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing
          strategies in the future.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The

          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes work together in
          specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for

          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key in disease
          development. Our research focuses on the association of diseases with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, showing that our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies
          mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid
          regulation, we have found that functionally important genes, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          traditional single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding
          complex traits and disease mechanisms, moving the field towards more
          comprehensive and effective therapeutic strategies.

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these interactions influence complex traits is
          essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          are crucial for disease etiology and progression. To address this gap,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. By grouping co-expressed genes into
          modules based on similar expression patterns, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show
          that diseases are linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to study lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important
          genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the power of our approach in uncovering
          novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes impact complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of how gene expression is regulated under
          various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between
          genes are key in disease development and progression. In this study,

          on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across specific
          conditions. By considering co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can
          provide context to genetic associations and identify potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.
          Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked to gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we
          demonstrate that functionally important genes may not show direct
          associations but are highlighted in trait-associated gene modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of
          co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across conditions,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs while elucidating mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking
          individual associations are highlighted in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, showcasing the power of our approach in uncovering novel
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes work together in
          specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for
          disease development and progression. To address this gap, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By grouping co-expressed
          genes into modules based on similar expression patterns across
          conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our
          results show that diseases are linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and reveals mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find
          that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
          innovative approach not only advances our understanding of gene
          interactions in complex traits but also has the potential to
          revolutionize drug discovery and therapeutic development.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation across
          various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of
          novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          current models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions
          between genes are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is constructed based on gene modules with similar expression patterns
          across specific conditions. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify
          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene approaches.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of gene expression regulation across various
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key in disease
          development and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          groups of genes with similar expression patterns across specific
          conditions, allowing for a contextualized view of genetic associations
          and the identification of potential targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. Our results show that diseases are linked to
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to
          investigate lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally
          important genes, which may not show direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting
          the utility of our approach in uncovering key players in complex
          traits.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how genes interact with each other in various contexts is crucial for
          uncovering disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets. While individual gene studies have provided valuable
          insights, the complex nature of genetic architecture suggests that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease development.
          To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation
          data to identify common patterns of gene expression. By grouping
          co-expressed genes into modules, PhenoPLIER offers a comprehensive
          analysis that can highlight potential targets that may be overlooked
          by traditional single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
          disease traits are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease relationships and elucidates underlying mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid
          regulation, we show that functionally important genes, which may not
          be directly associated with traits, are prioritized within
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This innovative method not
          only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also has the
          potential to advance drug repurposing efforts and identify new
          therapeutic avenues for complex diseases.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetics, genes work together in specific contexts to
          carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence
          complex traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression
          regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the
          development of new therapeutic approaches. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          are key in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across
          specific conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential targets overlooked by traditional
          single-gene approaches. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
          while elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
          screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that functionally
          important genes, which lack direct associations, are highlighted in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This research not only
          provides insights into gene interactions in complex traits but also
          offers a promising tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a
          detailed comprehension of gene expression regulation across various
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, current
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key in disease
          development and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          groups of genes with similar expression patterns under the same
          conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          approaches. Our results show that diseases are significantly linked to
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing
          on lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes
          without direct associations are highlighted in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER, showcasing the potential of our method in
          uncovering key players in complex traits.

              Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
              traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression
              regulation under various conditions. This understanding is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present

              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is

              relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation under
              diverse conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
              development of new therapies, as highlighted by previous research.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary
              models of complex trait architecture emphasize the importance of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. In
              this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational tool that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on gene modules with
              similar expression patterns across specific conditions. Our
              findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
              screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identify functionally
              important genes that may be overlooked by traditional single-gene
              approaches but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              provides a contextualized view of genetic associations and
              uncovers potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed
              by conventional strategies.

              Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these interactions influence
              complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are key in disease etiology. To
              address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that
              integrates gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data to
              identify common patterns of gene expression. Our analysis reveals
              that diseases are linked to specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important genes are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting potential
              targets missed by traditional single-gene approaches. By
              considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              comprehensive view of genetic associations, offering insights into
              disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a detailed knowledge of gene expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are key in
              disease onset and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across
              conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen on
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes
              lacking individual associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene approaches, advancing our understanding of complex
              traits and disease mechanisms.

              Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
              traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression
              regulation under various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for
              the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide

              that gene-gene interactions are key in disease progression. In
              this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological data to
              analyze gene expression patterns across different conditions. Our
              approach identifies gene modules with similar expression patterns,
              revealing significant associations between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease relationships and uncovers potential
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when
              they lack direct associations. By considering groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive view of
              genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches, advancing our understanding
              of complex traits and disease mechanisms.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes work together in concert in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions. Understanding how these genes impact complex
              traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression
              regulation under various conditions. This understanding is crucial
              for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in

              relevant cell types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known
              drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally important genes that lack
              individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we

            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and

              Introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on gene modules with
              similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our
              findings demonstrate that diseases are closely linked to gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease associations while
              elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
              screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identify functionally
              important players that may not be individually associated but are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes collaborate in
              specific contexts to carry out their functions, underscoring the
              importance of understanding how these interactions influence
              complex traits across diverse conditions. This mechanistic insight
              is crucial for the development of new therapies, as evidenced by
              transcriptome-wide association studies that have illuminated the
              role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However,
              contemporary models of complex trait architecture emphasize the
              critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
              progression.

              In the context of genetic studies and functional genomics, the
              manuscript 'Projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms' introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on gene modules with
              similar expression patterns across various conditions, enabling
              the identification of disease-associated gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
              action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid
              regulation, the study reveals that functionally significant genes,
              while lacking direct associations, are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Through the incorporation
              of co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that may

              synergistically in specific contexts to carry out their roles,
              emphasizing the importance of understanding gene expression

              In the field of computational biology, PhenoPLIER is introduced as
              a novel approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              constructed based on gene modules exhibiting similar expression
              patterns across specific conditions. The study reveals that
              diseases are notably linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent
              cell types, with the approach demonstrating accuracy in predicting
              known drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, through the analysis of lipid regulation
              using a CRISPR screen, the research identifies functionally
              significant players that lack direct associations but are
              highlighted in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data through a shared latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is built on gene
              modules with similar expression patterns under specific
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are closely
              linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
              while elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a
              CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally significant players prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, despite lacking direct
              associations. By leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes work synergistically
              in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a
              mechanistic understanding of their expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing
              innovative therapies, as highlighted by the critical role of
              transcriptome-wide association studies in unraveling the
              contributions of individual genes to disease mechanisms. However,

              In the field of computational biology, the manuscript introduces
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a

              important genes, lacking individual associations, are prioritized
              within trait-associated modules identified by PhenoPLIER. By

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have advanced our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet there
              remains a gap in projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation through gene modules with similar expression
              patterns. We demonstrate that diseases are linked to gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of
              action. Using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              identify functionally important genes prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By leveraging co-expressed
              gene groups, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and
              uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              Genes operate in concert with one another in specific contexts,
              necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing
              new therapies, as gene-gene interactions are predicted to play a
              pivotal role in disease origin and progression, surpassing the
              role of individual genes highlighted by transcriptome-wide
              association studies. In conclusion, our study highlights the
              importance of gene expression patterns in elucidating disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for the
              identification of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
              strategies through the clustering of complex traits.

              In the context of understanding the genetic basis of complex
              traits and diseases, there is a need for computational approaches

              Introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is built on gene
              modules exhibiting similar expression patterns under specific
              conditions. Our findings demonstrate a significant correlation
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types, with PhenoPLIER accurately predicting known drug-disease
              relationships and elucidating underlying mechanisms of action. A
              CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation highlights that
              functionally important genes, although lacking direct
              associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Genes collaborate in
              specific contexts to carry out their functions, underscoring the
              importance of understanding their regulatory mechanisms across
              diverse conditions. This mechanistic insight is crucial for the
              development of new therapies, as transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture emphasize the pivotal role of gene-gene interactions
              in disease etiology and progression.

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have advanced our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet gaps
              remain in connecting genetic associations with gene expression

              we identify functionally important genes prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the power of
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups to uncover potential
              therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies.

              In the field of computational biology, the manuscript introduces
              PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data through a
              common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is constructed based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across specific conditions, revealing
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. The approach demonstrates
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
              investigate lipid regulation, the study identifies functionally
              important genes that lack individual associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              leveraging groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by
              single-gene strategies. The findings highlight the collaborative
              nature of genes in specific contexts to execute their functions,
              emphasizing the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation across diverse conditions to decipher complex traits.
              This mechanistic insight is crucial for the development of new
              therapies, as gene-gene interactions are predicted to play a
              pivotal role in disease onset and progression, surpassing the
              traditional focus on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms
              as revealed by transcriptome-wide association studies. The
              integration of PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for advancing
              our understanding of complex traits and accelerating the discovery
              of therapeutic targets.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, the
              manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across specific conditions, PhenoPLIER accurately

              relevant cell types and elucidates mechanisms of action for known
              drug-disease pairs. Through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid
              regulation, functionally important genes lacking associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              approach, which incorporates co-expressed gene groups, provides a

              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. Understanding how genes collaborate in specific

              In the context of understanding the complex interplay between
              genes, traits, and pharmacological perturbations, this manuscript
              introduces PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a
              shared latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various
              conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Through accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and
              inference of mechanisms of action, this approach proves effective
              in uncovering valuable insights. Notably, our analysis using a
              CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation demonstrates that
              functionally important genes lacking individual associations are
              prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              leveraging co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER not only
              contextualizes genetic associations but also identifies potential
              targets that may be overlooked by traditional single-gene
              strategies. This study underscores the importance of understanding
              how genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, emphasizing the need for a mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is increasingly
              recognized that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in the onset
              and progression of complex traits. By bridging the gap between
              single-gene approaches and the complex architecture of traits,
              PhenoPLIER offers a promising avenue for advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic
              targets.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a detailed knowledge of expression regulation
              under various conditions. This understanding is crucial for the

              In the field of genetics, the interaction between genes in
              specific contexts is essential for understanding complex traits.
              To unravel how genes influence these traits, a detailed
              understanding of gene expression regulation across various
              conditions is necessary. This knowledge is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. While individual genes have been
              studied in transcriptome-wide association studies to uncover their
              roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are key in disease development and progression. We

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation
              under various conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
              development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in
              disease etiology and progression. Our research demonstrates a
              significant association between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, with our approach accurately
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid
              regulation, we identify functionally significant players that may
              lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across identical conditions, enabling
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies.

              Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific
              contexts to influence complex traits, highlighting the importance
              of understanding gene expression regulation across different
              conditions for the development of new therapies. While

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe
            that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
            PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
            that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
            data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a detailed understanding of expression regulation

              development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, it is now recognized that gene-gene interactions are
              crucial in the origin and progression of diseases. Our research
              shows that diseases are closely linked to gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid
              regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes may
              not show direct associations but are highlighted in

              computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological data to analyze them jointly. This approach is
              based on groups of co-expressed genes, allowing for a

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes work together in

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation
              under various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the
              development of new therapeutic interventions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture highlight the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and progression. Our research
              demonstrates a significant association between diseases and gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, with our approach
              accurately predicting known drug-disease relationships and
              elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
              screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally
              important players that lack direct associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Introducing

              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in
              disease etiology and progression. Our research shows that diseases
              are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR
              screen reveals that functionally important genes lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER, our novel computational approach,
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. Our findings not only provide insights into disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms but also pave the way for more
              effective therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing
              strategies in the future.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes work together in
              specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              key in disease development. Our research focuses on the
              association of diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, showing that our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action. By
              utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we have found
              that functionally important genes, although lacking associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our computational
              approach, PhenoPLIER. This novel method maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis, based on gene modules
              with similar expression patterns across conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              that may be overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies. Our
              findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions in understanding complex traits and disease
              mechanisms, moving the field towards more comprehensive and
              effective therapeutic strategies.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              key in disease development and progression. To address this, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression
              patterns across conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize
              genetic associations and identify potential targets missed by
              single-gene approaches. Our results show that diseases are linked
              to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and uncovers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes
              without direct associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the power of our approach in
              uncovering novel insights in complex trait analysis.

              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section

              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes work together in
              specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              crucial for disease development and progression. To address this
              gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By grouping co-expressed genes into modules based on
              similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential
              targets overlooked by single-gene approaches. Our results show
              that diseases are linked to gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              relationships and reveals mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              innovative approach not only advances our understanding of gene
              interactions in complex traits but also has the potential to
              revolutionize drug discovery and therapeutic development.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression
              regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial
              for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, current models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal
              in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              constructed based on gene modules with similar expression patterns
              across specific conditions. By incorporating co-expressed gene
              groups, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              identify potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. Our findings show that diseases are significantly
              linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              method accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
              screen focusing on lipid regulation, we demonstrate that

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a detailed understanding of how gene expression is
              regulated across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the roles of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that
              interactions between genes are key in the development and
              progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological data to identify potential therapeutic targets.
              PhenoPLIER maps these associations into a common latent
              representation based on groups of genes with similar expression
              patterns across various conditions. By considering co-expressed
              gene modules, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic
              associations and identify targets that may have been overlooked by
              traditional single-gene approaches. Our analysis reveals that
              diseases are closely linked to gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important genes may not show direct
              associations but are highlighted in trait-associated gene modules
              by PhenoPLIER.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how genes interact with each other in various
              contexts is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and
              identifying potential therapeutic targets. While individual gene
              studies have provided valuable insights, the complex nature of
              genetic architecture suggests that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in disease development. To address this gap, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data to identify
              common patterns of gene expression. By grouping co-expressed genes
              into modules, PhenoPLIER offers a comprehensive analysis that can
              highlight potential targets that may be overlooked by traditional
              single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that disease
              traits are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and elucidates underlying mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid
              regulation, we show that functionally important genes, which may
              not be directly associated with traits, are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This innovative method not
              only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also has
              the potential to advance drug repurposing efforts and identify new
              therapeutic avenues for complex diseases.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              necessitates a detailed comprehension of expression regulation
              under various conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
              development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation
              is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across
              identical conditions. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. Our findings indicate that diseases are closely linked
              to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR
              screen focusing on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally
              significant players may not exhibit direct associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
