Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is critical for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nRevised Keywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, gene-gene interactions, disease etiology, pharmacological perturbation, CRISPR screens."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is critical for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we discovered that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes with similar expression patterns across conditions as modules, PhenoPLIER allows us to observe significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action but also uncovers functionally important players that lack individual gene associations. Through the analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes these players in trait-associated modules. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. This research highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts for complex traits."

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across diverse conditions, as this insight is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes' involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results indicate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.\n\nIn this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferrs mechanisms of action.\n\nUsing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fail to account for the intricate gene-gene interactions that are now recognized as key players in disease etiology. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, as evidenced by the prioritization of functionally important players lacking individual gene associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to serve as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby facilitating the identification of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for complex traits.

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, a critical aspect in developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering individual gene associations with disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits.\n\nPhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach excels in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, can be prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations, thereby revealing potential therapeutic targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " The study of genetic associations with complex traits and diseases has traditionally focused on individual genes, overlooking the potential role of gene-gene interactions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to understanding the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they may not fully capture the complexity of these interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by identifying functionally important players lacking individual gene associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and diseases."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in the context of complex networks, and understanding how they collectively regulate expression across various conditions is essential to elucidate their influence on complex traits. This knowledge is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative representation relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our analyses reveal that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules in specific cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, PhenoPLIER represents a valuable tool in functional genomics, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fail to capture the intricate interplay among genes. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate that functionally important players, overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides new opportunities for identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits' clustering and disease etiology."

          "output": " In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Recognizing that genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute their roles, an in-depth understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is vital for therapy development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to the discovery of individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's methodology relies on the organization of genes into modules based on their expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach is proficient in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through an analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations, thereby revealing potential targets that might have been overlooked through conventional single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations from the perspective of gene modules and holds promise for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in complex traits.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies; Functional genomics; Gene co-expression; Therapeutic targets; Drug repurposing; Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in understanding the role of individual genes in complex traits and diseases through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and progression, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to study these relationships. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules when expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis revealed that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, thereby providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and advancing functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes operate in coordination with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes impact complex traits, which is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits.\n\nPhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative framework facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " The study of genetic associations with complex traits has been predominantly focused on individual genes, overlooking the importance of gene-gene interactions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to understanding the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fail to capture the intricate interplay among genes that is critical for a comprehensive view of disease etiology and therapeutic development. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, as revealed through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations, contextualizing them to reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This research not only fills the gap in our understanding of gene-gene interactions in complex traits but also highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for drug repurposing and uncovering novel therapeutic targets."

Our study reveals that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Leveraging a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes, which lack individual genetic associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that might have been overlooked using single-gene methodologies. This novel framework proposed by PhenoPLIER facilitates the interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby offering a valuable resource for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs in complex trait etiology."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanisms of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for developing novel therapies. This study reveals that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen uncovers functionally important genes that are not associated but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

Specifically, we find that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation.

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits and developing novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes, which lack direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations, thereby revealing potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the examination of gene modules, paving the way for enhanced drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in complex trait etiology.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies; Functional genomics; Gene co-expression; Therapeutic targets; Drug repurposing; Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanics of expression regulation across various conditions, which is critical for the development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our approach proves effective in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial elements lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations, thereby revealing potential targets that might have been overlooked through single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

By interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for understanding complex traits and identifying therapeutic targets, which may be particularly useful for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

This mechanistic insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Our study reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes, which lack individual genetic associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER integrates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations, thereby revealing potential targets that may have been overlooked by traditional single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This understanding is essential for elucidating disease etiology and developing effective therapies. Current approaches often focus on individual gene-disease associations, overlooking the potential impact of gene co-expression patterns. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns to reveal functionally important players in complex traits. By clustering genes based on their co-expression across various conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation revealed functionally important genes lacking individual associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating gene co-expression information to contextualize genetic associations and uncover hidden therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER offers a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contributing to the fields of functional genomics, drug repurposing, and complex trait clustering."

          "output": " Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual genes' role in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation revealed that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study underscores the potential of functional genomics in highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms, supporting therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts, and emphasizing the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in complex traits research."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that underlie disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This integration is based on gene co-expression modules, which are derived from genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " Genes operate in coordination with each other within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture emphasize the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease manifestation. To address this gap in knowledge, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and furthermore, we demonstrate its utility by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": " Genes frequently operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of gene-gene interactions on complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not account for the important role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space based on co-expressed gene modules. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate PhenoPLIER's ability to prioritize functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our results highlight the potential of integrating functional genomics data to uncover novel genetic associations, inform drug repurposing efforts, and improve our understanding of complex trait architecture."

          "output": " Genes frequently operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to disease origin and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, facilitating joint analysis. This representation is built upon modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. By representing genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions as modules, our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and further show that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating functional genomics and pharmacological data to uncover novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby facilitating drug repurposing and the development of new therapies."

          "output": " Genes operate in coordination with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important elements, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies; Functional genomics; Gene co-expression; Therapeutic targets; Drug repurposing; Clustering of complex traits."

          "output": " In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts. However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes collectively influence complex traits through expression regulation across various conditions remains elusive. This knowledge gap is critical as it hinders the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the crucial role that gene-gene interactions play in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, our approach provides a new avenue for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs through the clustering of complex traits and functional genomics."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression.

Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential to reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing these associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets in complex traits. This approach has broader significance for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, enabling more effective drug repurposing and functional genomics studies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, Functional genomics, Gene co-expression, Therapeutic targets, Drug repurposing, Clustering of complex traits.",

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence complex traits remains an open question. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes with similar expression patterns across conditions as modules, PhenoPLIER allows us to observe significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach not only accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action but also uncovers functionally important players that lack individual gene associations. Through the analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes these players in trait-associated modules. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. This research highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in functional genomics and drug repurposing efforts for complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.\n\nIn this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferrs mechanisms of action.\n\nUsing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fail to account for the intricate gene-gene interactions that are now recognized as key players in disease etiology. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, as evidenced by the prioritization of functionally important players lacking individual gene associations in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to serve as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby facilitating the identification of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for complex traits.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to understanding the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they may not fully capture the complexity of these interactions. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by identifying functionally important players lacking individual gene associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results suggest that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and diseases.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes function in the context of complex networks, and understanding how they collectively regulate expression across various conditions is essential to elucidate their influence on complex traits. This knowledge is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative representation relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our analyses reveal that diseases are strongly associated with these gene modules in specific cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations via gene modules, PhenoPLIER represents a valuable tool in functional genomics, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. By representing genes as modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Recognizing that genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to execute their roles, an in-depth understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions is essential to elucidate the influence of these genes on complex traits, which is vital for therapy development. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to the discovery of individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits. PhenoPLIER's methodology relies on the organization of genes into modules based on their expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach is proficient in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through an analysis of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant genes lacking individual associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations, thereby revealing potential targets that might have been overlooked through conventional single-gene strategies. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations from the perspective of gene modules and holds promise for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in complex traits.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies; Functional genomics; Gene co-expression; Therapeutic targets; Drug repurposing; Clustering of complex traits.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

Genes function in the context of intricate networks, executing their roles through coordinated expression regulation across various conditions. A mechanistic understanding of these expression patterns is critical for elucidating complex trait etiology and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-disease associations, recent genetic research highlights the importance of gene-gene interactions in shaping disease architecture.\n\nLeveraging gene co-expression patterns across comparable conditions, PhenoPLIER represents gene modules to identify significant connections between these modules and diseases within relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we demonstrate that functionally important genes, which may lack individual gene-trait associations, are effectively prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might be overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. Our methodology offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating advancements in both functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery.\n\nKeywords: Genetic studies; Functional genomics; Gene co-expression; Therapeutic targets; Drug repurposing; Clustering of complex traits.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not account for the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This advances our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, with implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " The study of genetic associations with complex traits has been predominantly focused on individual genes, overlooking the importance of gene-gene interactions. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to understanding the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, they fail to capture the intricate interplay among genes that is critical for a comprehensive view of disease etiology and therapeutic development. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, as revealed through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations, contextualizing them to reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This research not only fills the gap in our understanding of gene-gene interactions in complex traits but also highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for drug repurposing and uncovering novel therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

However, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is required to determine these genetic influences. Here, we present a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study highlights the potential of functional genomics in identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex traits. By integrating gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a framework to enhance our understanding of genetic associations, thereby facilitating the development of novel treatments for various diseases.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A comprehensive understanding of how these genes regulate complex traits necessitates elucidating the mechanisms of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for developing novel therapies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a new approach that integrates gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to project genetic associations. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important genes lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by contextualizing genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER not only reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies but also provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, thereby contributing to the identification of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Current methods rely on a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, but these approaches may overlook important players that lack individual genetic associations. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel framework that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for understanding complex traits and identifying therapeutic targets, which may be particularly useful for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits. Overall, our study highlights the importance of functional genomics in elucidating the genetic architecture of complex traits and identifying novel therapeutic strategies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the field of genetic studies, identifying the relationship between genes and complex traits is a crucial yet unresolved challenge. This understanding is essential for elucidating disease etiology and developing effective therapies. Current approaches often focus on individual gene-disease associations, overlooking the potential impact of gene co-expression patterns. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns to reveal functionally important players in complex traits. By clustering genes based on their co-expression across various conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation revealed functionally important genes lacking individual associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating gene co-expression information to contextualize genetic associations and uncover hidden therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER offers a valuable framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contributing to the fields of functional genomics, drug repurposing, and complex trait clustering.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that underlie disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This integration is based on gene co-expression modules, which are derived from genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to uncover novel gene-gene interactions and inform drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification for complex traits.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease manifestation. To address this gap in knowledge, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, enabling the identification of significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, and furthermore, we demonstrate its utility by identifying functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study highlights the potential of functional genomics approaches in uncovering therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for complex traits.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for elucidating the influence of gene-gene interactions on complex traits, which is vital for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to uncovering individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation to facilitate joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER proves effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-trait associations, they do not account for the important role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space based on co-expressed gene modules. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we validate PhenoPLIER's ability to prioritize functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. Our results highlight the potential of integrating functional genomics data to uncover novel genetic associations, inform drug repurposing efforts, and improve our understanding of complex trait architecture.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. By representing genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions as modules, our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and specific gene modules. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and further show that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by our method. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating functional genomics and pharmacological data to uncover novel insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby facilitating drug repurposing and the development of new therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": " In the field of genetics, it is well-established that genes function in concert with each other in specific contexts. However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes collectively influence complex traits through expression regulation across various conditions remains elusive. This knowledge gap is critical as it hinders the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the crucial role that gene-gene interactions play in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Thus, our approach provides a new avenue for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs through the clustering of complex traits and functional genomics.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "paragraph": "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."
