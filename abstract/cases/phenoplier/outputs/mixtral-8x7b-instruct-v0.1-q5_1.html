 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a joint latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 The development of effective therapies relies on a comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes involved in disease-relevant processes, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression (context). Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method clusters genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions into modules and reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (content). Furthermore, PhenoPLIER excels at predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action while also identifying functionally important players that lack individual gene associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive perspective on genetic associations, uncovering potential targets otherwise overlooked by single-gene strategies (conclusion). This novel framework bridges the gap between gene expression and disease etiology, enabling more precise drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.">[FAIL] (0.91) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. A comprehensive understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of expression across various conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the individual genes' role in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation to enable joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate that functionally important players, lacking individual gene associations, can be prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our approach offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis. Recognizing that genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts, we argue that understanding the regulation of expression across various conditions is essential to elucidate how genes influence complex traits, thereby facilitating the development of new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. Leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions, PhenoPLIER demonstrates significant associations between diseases and relevant cell types' gene modules. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation via CRISPR screening reveals that functionally important genes, which may otherwise be overlooked by single-gene strategies, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Collectively, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might have been missed through conventional single-gene approaches. By interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms in the context of functional genomics.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual gene's contribution to disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are critical in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER represents gene modules with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions, and we observe a significant association between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, an analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens reveals that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

 In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes frequently operate in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their functions. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential to elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, which is vital for developing effective new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene contributions to disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression.

PhenoPLIER's approach is centered on gene modules with comparable expression patterns across similar conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are substantially associated with these gene modules in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights potential targets that might be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules offers a valuable tool for disease etiology research and drug mechanism exploration.
