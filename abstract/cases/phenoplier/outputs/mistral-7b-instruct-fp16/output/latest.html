Genes operate in concert with one another to perform their functions within specific contexts. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Genetic studies have long sought to understand the complex interplay between genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current methods are limited in their ability to account for gene-gene interactions and the contextual regulation of expression patterns across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses gene co-expression analysis to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings provide a novel approach to gene expression analysis that has the potential to improve our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately leading to more effective therapeutic targets and repurposing strategies.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the complex interactions between genes and how they influence disease development and progression. However, traditional approaches to studying gene expression patterns across different conditions have limitations, as they often focus on individual genes rather than their interactions with other genes. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on the idea that genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions are likely to be involved in similar biological processes, allowing us to identify potential drug targets and mechanisms of action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case studies, including a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, which revealed important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease research and demonstrates the value of computational approaches for identifying potential drug targets and mechanisms of action.

Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational tool that integrates gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation information to generate a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. By doing so, we reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions in specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Our study highlights the critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, which has been predicted by modern models of complex trait architecture. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic associations by integrating gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation information. This integration enables us to identify potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies on disease etiology and drug mechanism, which will ultimately lead to the development of new therapies.

The field of genetic studies is rapidly evolving, and functional genomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding how genes interact with each other and contribute to disease development. However, the complexity of gene-gene interactions makes it challenging to identify therapeutic targets or predict drug repurposing. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology by identifying modules of genes with similar expression profiles in relevant cell types. Our analysis reveals that diseases are associated with these gene modules, which can be used to predict drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene co-expression analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. Our approach has broader significance by providing a framework for drug repurposing and identifying novel therapeutic targets in complex diseases.

Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering gene expression patterns and interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which has been shown to be critical for developing new therapies. Overall, our study contributes to the growing body of literature on genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits by providing a novel method that bridges these fields.

The field of computational biology has seen significant advancements in recent years, with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) providing valuable insights into the role of individual genes in complex diseases. However, these studies often fail to capture the interactions between genes that are critical for understanding disease mechanisms. To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Using PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and underscores the need for a more comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel approach to contextualizing genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can help uncover the role of gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms, which is critical for developing new therapies. Our findings highlight the importance of considering expression regulation across different conditions in understanding complex traits and underscore the need for more comprehensive models of disease mechanisms.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. However, the traditional approach of studying individual genes has limitations in predicting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on the idea that groups of co-expressed genes can provide contextual information that may be missed by single-gene strategies. In this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation in a CRISPR screen and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, highlighting its importance in identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex traits. Overall, our work provides a novel computational tool that can bridge the gap between genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding complex traits and identifies potential therapeutic targets for disease treatment.

Genetic studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet the complex nature of these phenomena often hinders their interpretation. To address this challenge, functional genomics approaches have been developed to identify gene-gene interactions that underlie disease development and progression. However, traditional methods for analyzing gene expression patterns are limited by their focus on individual genes and fail to account for the contextual relationships between them. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression analysis to map genetic associations onto a common latent representation of gene modules and pharmacological perturbation data. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, our work highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug discovery, and paves the way for new therapeutic strategies based on clustering complex traits.

Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug discovery, and provides a novel computational approach for identifying potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action.

Genetic studies have been instrumental in uncovering the mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug action. However, traditional approaches to studying complex traits often fail to account for gene-gene interactions, which are critical for understanding disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach allows us to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies.

The study of genes and their interactions with each other is an essential area of research in understanding complex traits and disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes associated with diseases, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. This gap in the literature calls for a more comprehensive approach to identify gene-trait associations and potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. Overall, our study provides a novel computational approach to identify gene-trait associations and potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, which has broader significance for developing new therapies and understanding complex disease mechanisms.
