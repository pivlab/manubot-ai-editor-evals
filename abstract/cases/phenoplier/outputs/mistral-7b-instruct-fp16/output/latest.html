Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, but determining how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance for understanding complex traits and developing new therapies.

Genetic studies have long been critical for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current approaches to studying complex traits often rely on single-gene analyses, which may miss important interactions between genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression patterns with pharmacological perturbation data for a joint analysis of gene-trait associations. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions and uses these modules to contextualize genetic associations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing disease associations, drug-disease pairs, and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use PhenoPLIER to prioritize functionally important players in lipid regulation, even when they lack direct associations with traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, offering new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach has broader significance as it can facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and enable the repurposing of drugs for new indications.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis of complex traits. This is an important gap in the current literature as genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we observe are significantly associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER can help identify new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of complex traits.

In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation and disease-associated gene sets to identify potential therapeutic targets for complex diseases. By leveraging the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns under various conditions, we create a common latent representation that allows for a joint analysis of genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach is based on the idea that genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and that understanding this interplay is critical for developing effective treatments.

We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through several case studies, including the identification of disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as the prediction of known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. We also use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Overall, our results highlight the importance of gene modules in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in complex diseases. By contextualizing gene expression data with functional genomics information, we can identify potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies, leading to more effective treatments for patients.

In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER is able to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We present an executive summary of our results, which show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our work provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in complex trait research.

Genetic studies have long struggled to identify functional genes and their interactions in complex traits, hindering the development of new therapies. This manuscript presents a novel approach to address this challenge by leveraging gene expression patterns to identify gene modules associated with disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our method, PhenoPLIER, uses clustering algorithms to group co-expressed genes in specific contexts, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and infer potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several examples, including identifying disease-associated gene modules and predicting known drug-disease pairs with high accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our method can prioritize functionally important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling us to better understand complex traits and develop more effective therapies.

The research provides evidence that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, the study shows that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER when using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

In recent years, the study of gene expression patterns has revolutionized our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to genetic studies have limitations when it comes to analyzing complex traits that involve interactions between multiple genes. To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression data to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on the idea that genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions are likely to be involved in the same biological processes. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by analyzing disease associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the importance of functional genomics in identifying therapeutic targets for complex diseases and suggest that gene co-expression analysis can be used to predict drug repurposing. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for researchers working on complex diseases and drug discovery.

Genetic studies have been instrumental in identifying disease-relevant mechanisms, and functional genomics has provided insights into gene expression patterns across different conditions. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

The field of genetics has long recognized the importance of studying gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to gene expression analysis have been limited in their ability to capture complex interactions between genes and traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages functional genomics data to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method is able to identify modules of genes that play crucial roles in disease development and drug response. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene co-expression analysis in identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for complex traits.
