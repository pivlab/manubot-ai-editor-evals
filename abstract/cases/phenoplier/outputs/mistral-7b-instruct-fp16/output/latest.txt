          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding
          the complex interactions between genes and how they influence disease
          development and progression. However, traditional approaches to
          studying gene expression patterns across different conditions have
          limitations, as they often focus on individual genes rather than their
          interactions with other genes. In this manuscript, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on
          the idea that genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions are likely to be involved in similar biological processes,
          allowing us to identify potential drug targets and mechanisms of
          action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several
          case studies, including a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, which
          revealed important players that lacked associations but were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
          providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and
          their underlying mechanisms. Overall, our work highlights the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease research
          and demonstrates the value of computational approaches for identifying
          potential drug targets and mechanisms of action.

          Genetic studies have long sought to understand the complex interplay
          between genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
          current methods are limited in their ability to account for gene-gene
          interactions and the contextual regulation of expression patterns
          across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses gene co-expression
          analysis to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and find that functionally important players lack

          our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately
          leading to more effective therapeutic targets and repurposing
          strategies.

          Gene expression regulation plays a crucial role in the development and

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes operate in concert with one another to perform their functions
          within specific contexts. Determining how these genes influence
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          and observe that functionally important players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          provide a computational tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          through functional genomics and clustering of complex traits.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
          identifying disease-associated genes, but the complexity of these
          diseases often requires a more nuanced approach to understanding their
          underlying mechanisms. The use of functional genomics techniques such
          as gene co-expression analysis can provide valuable insights into how
          genes interact with each other and contribute to complex traits.
          However, current methods for integrating gene expression data with
          other types of genomic and clinical data are limited by the lack of a
          common representation that can capture the relationships between these
          different types of information.


          To address this gap in the literature, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows
          us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case
          studies, including the prediction of known drug-disease pairs and the
          identification of functionally important players in lipid regulation
          that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. Our results highlight the importance of considering gene
          expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          suggest that our approach could be used to identify new therapeutic
          targets for complex diseases.


          Overall, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the field
          of genetic studies by providing a common representation that can
          capture the relationships between different types of genomic and
          clinical data. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
          method provides a more nuanced understanding of complex traits and
          their underlying mechanisms, which is critical for developing new
          therapies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify individual genes involved in disease mechanisms, but
          modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To
          address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with such modules in
          relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall,
          our study highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms and demonstrates
          the utility of computational approaches for identifying therapeutic
          targets and repurposing drugs.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Gene expression regulation is critical for the development of complex
          traits, including disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped identify individual genes involved in
          disease-relevant processes, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the
          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through an analysis of lipid regulation
          using a CRISPR screen, where we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes in understanding gene-gene interactions and
          their role in disease mechanisms. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          approach to contextualizing genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets for new therapies.

          The field of genetic studies is rapidly evolving, and functional
          genomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding how genes
          interact with each other and contribute to disease development.
          However, the complexity of gene-gene interactions makes it challenging
          to identify therapeutic targets or predict drug repurposing. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges
          the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology by
          identifying modules of genes with similar expression profiles in
          relevant cell types. Our analysis reveals that diseases are associated
          with these gene modules, which can be used to predict drug-disease
          pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
          PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. By
          contextualizing genetic associations through gene co-expression
          analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical
          for developing new therapies. Our approach has broader significance by
          providing a framework for drug repurposing and identifying novel
          therapeutic targets in complex diseases.

          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational tool that integrates
          gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation information to
          generate a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          approach is based on the identification of modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our analysis
          reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. By doing so, we reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in
          concert with each other to perform their functions in specific
          contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. Our study highlights the critical role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, which has
          been predicted by modern models of complex trait architecture.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights
          into the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of
          the genetic associations by integrating gene expression data with
          pharmacological perturbation information. This integration enables us
          to identify potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          opportunities. Our findings provide a foundation for future studies on
          disease etiology and drug mechanism, which will ultimately lead to the
          development of new therapies.

          The field of genetics has long been interested in understanding how
          genes interact with each other to produce complex traits. However,
          current models of the architecture of complex traits do not fully
          capture the complexity of these interactions. In this manuscript, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait

          In recent years, the field of functional genomics has made significant
          strides in understanding the complex interplay between genes and their
          functions. However, determining how these genes influence disease
          mechanisms remains a major challenge. To address this gap, we have
          developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by analyzing
          disease-relevant mechanisms and identifying known drug-disease pairs
          and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the importance of gene co-expression
          in disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery, and provide valuable
          insights into the development of novel therapies.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          The study of genes acting in concert with each other is crucial for
          understanding their functions in specific contexts. Determining how
          these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic

          for identifying therapeutic targets and predicting drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene expression data with genetic studies to identify
          potential therapeutic targets for complex diseases. Our approach
          leverages modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns
          across different conditions, and we demonstrate that diseases are
          associated with these modules in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action by prioritizing functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, our method can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings
          highlight the importance of understanding expression regulation across
          different conditions to develop new therapies for complex diseases. We
          show that transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. Therefore, our method provides a
          novel approach to identifying drug repurposing opportunities by
          clustering complex traits based on gene expression patterns.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in recent
          years with functional genomics approaches highlighting gene
          co-expression patterns as potential therapeutic targets for disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the current state-of-the-art
          lacks a comprehensive approach that can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis of complex traits. Our approach is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          provide a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies.
          We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of gene
          co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
          provide a new tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing
          drugs. By filling this gap in the current literature, our work has
          broader significance for the development of personalized medicine and
          precision therapies.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene
          expression data with genetic studies and pharmacological perturbation
          information to identify disease-associated gene modules. Our approach
          uses clustering of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions to create a common latent representation for
          joint analysis. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and drug

          can provide context for genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Gene expression patterns
          play a critical role in complex traits, and understanding their
          regulation across different conditions is essential for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          identify individual genes associated with disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression.
          Therefore, our approach provides a valuable tool for uncovering
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the analysis of gene
          expression patterns.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The field of genetics has made significant strides in recent years,
          with transcriptome-wide association studies revealing individual
          genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          crucial in disease origin and progression. This manuscript introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This reveals the importance of understanding gene
          expression regulation across different conditions to determine how
          genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies. In
          conclusion, our approach provides a valuable tool for studying disease
          mechanisms and drug discovery, filling a gap in the current literature
          by integrating gene-gene interactions into the analysis of complex
          traits.

          The field of computational biology has seen significant advancements
          in recent years, with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
          providing valuable insights into the role of individual genes in
          complex diseases. However, these studies often fail to capture the
          interactions between genes that are critical for understanding disease
          mechanisms. To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows
          us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          Using PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the importance
          of considering gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and
          underscores the need for a more comprehensive understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel approach to contextualizing
          genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          our approach can help uncover the role of gene-gene interactions in
          disease mechanisms, which is critical for developing new therapies.
          Our findings highlight the importance of considering expression
          regulation across different conditions in understanding complex traits
          and underscore the need for more comprehensive models of disease
          mechanisms.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          to create a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

          potential of PhenoPLIER for drug repurposing and clustering of complex
          traits.

          The field of functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding
          of how genetic variations contribute to disease risk and therapeutic
          response. However, existing methods have difficulty capturing the
          complex interplay between genes and traits, particularly when multiple
          genes are involved in a disease process. This manuscript presents
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses this gap by
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
          identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions, and we show that diseases are significantly
          associated with these modules in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action, demonstrating its utility as a tool for drug repurposing and
          identifying novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, our approach
          highlights the importance of contextualizing genetic associations by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. We illustrate this point
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression, and that understanding these interactions is essential
          for developing new therapies. Overall, this work advances our
          knowledge of the genetic basis of complex traits and provides a
          powerful tool for drug discovery and repurposing.

          In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding
          how genes work together to influence complex traits. However, the
          traditional approach of studying individual genes has limitations in
          predicting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To overcome this
          challenge, we propose a computational approach called PhenoPLIER that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach
          is based on the idea that groups of co-expressed genes can provide
          contextual information that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
          In this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation in a CRISPR
          screen and found that functionally important players lack associations
          but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results
          demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, highlighting
          its importance in identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing
          drugs for complex traits. Overall, our work provides a novel
          computational tool that can bridge the gap between genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns

          considering gene expression patterns and interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, which has been shown to be critical for
          developing new therapies. Overall, our study contributes to the
          growing body of literature on genetic studies, functional genomics,
          gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and
          clustering of complex traits by providing a novel method that bridges
          these fields.

          Genetic studies have long been used to identify disease risk factors,
          but the complexity of gene interactions makes it difficult to
          determine how these factors contribute to disease development and
          progression. To address this challenge, researchers have turned to
          functional genomics approaches that analyze gene expression patterns
          across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been successful in identifying individual genes
          associated with specific diseases, recent models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and

          targets and drug repurposing opportunities, with broader implications
          for the development of new treatments for complex diseases.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in complex traits and
          disease mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to understanding
          these patterns have limitations, particularly when considering
          gene-gene interactions. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This approach takes into account groups of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the
          accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs,
          inferring mechanisms of action, and identifying disease-associated
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our findings highlight
          the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in complex trait
          studies and provide a powerful tool for drug repurposing and
          therapeutic target discovery.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The study of gene expression patterns has been instrumental in

          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Functional genomics techniques have been used to study gene-gene
          interactions, but they often fail to capture the contextual factors
          that influence expression regulation. In this manuscript, we present a
          novel approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the
          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and show that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
          approach provides a valuable tool for identifying therapeutic targets
          and repurposing drugs based on their mechanisms of action.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do not
          act in isolation but rather work together in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          results demonstrate the efficacy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Specifically,
          we show that using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings
          highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions and the
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies in understanding
          complex traits and developing new therapies. Overall, our work
          provides a valuable resource for researchers working in this field and
          has broader implications for drug discovery and precision medicine.

          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes.
          Furthermore, we show that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of gene
          co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a
          novel tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions in
          specific contexts, but determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          However, existing methods for analyzing gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data do not account for this complexity,
          missing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.


          In this study, we use PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation in a
          CRISPR screen. We find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules,
          highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          disease mechanisms. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing valuable
          insights into complex traits for therapeutic development. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the field, enabling
          researchers to better understand how genes interact to influence
          disease and identify potential targets for new therapies.

          Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the complexity of the human
          genome and its interactions with other molecules make it difficult to
          identify specific genes that contribute to complex traits. In this
          manuscript, we propose a novel computational approach called
          PhenoPLIER that combines gene expression data and pharmacological
          perturbation data to map gene-trait associations into a common latent
          representation. By using modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
          Overall, our work highlights the importance of gene co-expression
          analysis in identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for
          complex traits.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally

          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The study of complex traits involves understanding the interactions
          between multiple genes and their impact on disease mechanisms.
          However, traditional approaches to genetic studies have focused
          primarily on individual gene associations with disease outcomes. This
          manuscript presents a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER
          that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. The authors demonstrate the
          effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through a variety of analyses, including
          the identification of disease-associated gene modules in relevant cell
          types and the prediction of known drug-disease pairs. Additionally,
          they use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, this study provides a
          valuable contribution to the field of functional genomics by
          highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in understanding
          complex traits and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. While

          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the

          Context: The field of genetics and disease research has made
          significant strides in recent years, with the identification of
          individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms through
          transcriptome-wide association studies. However, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression, which requires a more
          comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This study aims to address this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis.


          Content: PhenoPLIER is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows it to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. The approach has been tested using disease
          association data and CRISPR screens, and the results show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for functionally
          important players that lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules.


          Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of incorporating
          gene-gene interactions in disease research and demonstrates how
          PhenoPLIER can provide valuable insights into complex traits. The
          findings suggest that disease-relevant mechanisms involve groups of
          co-expressed genes, which may have broader significance for drug
          discovery and development. Overall, this study contributes to our
          understanding of gene expression regulation and its role in disease
          pathogenesis.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The study of complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, requires a comprehensive understanding of how genes
          interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided
          valuable insights into the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To

          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell

          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel tool for uncovering
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the analysis of gene
          expression patterns.

          Genetic studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet the complex nature of these
          phenomena often hinders their interpretation. To address this
          challenge, functional genomics approaches have been developed to
          identify gene-gene interactions that underlie disease development and
          progression. However, traditional methods for analyzing gene
          expression patterns are limited by their focus on individual genes and
          fail to account for the contextual relationships between them. In this
          manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that leverages gene co-expression analysis to map genetic associations
          onto a common latent representation of gene modules and
          pharmacological perturbation data. By integrating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive
          understanding of disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic
          targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          results demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well
          as identifying functionally important players that lack associations
          but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, our work
          highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in disease
          etiology and drug discovery, and paves the way for new therapeutic
          strategies based on clustering complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Gene expression plays a crucial role in the development and
          progression of complex traits, including diseases. However, current
          models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          key role in disease origin and progression. To understand these
          interactions and identify potential targets for new therapies,
          researchers have been using transcriptome-wide association studies to
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, these studies have limitations in identifying the contextual
          relationships between genes and traits.


          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          approach uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


          Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results
          highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions and
          contextual relationships in understanding complex traits and
          developing new therapies. Overall, our approach provides a powerful
          tool for identifying potential targets and mechanisms of action in
          complex diseases.

          Gene expression is critical for the development and progression of
          complex traits, including diseases. However, our understanding of how
          genes interact with each other and how these interactions influence
          disease mechanisms remains limited. To address this gap in the
          literature, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.


          PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across conditions to contextualize genetic associations, revealing
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.


          To further validate our approach, we conducted a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players
          lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and demonstrate how
          PhenoPLIER can advance our understanding of complex traits.


          In conclusion, our study provides a novel computational approach for
          analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data to identify potential targets and mechanisms of action in complex
          traits. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate the importance of
          considering gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and provide a
          valuable tool for developing new therapies.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have been instrumental in uncovering the mechanisms
          underlying disease etiology and drug action. However, traditional
          approaches to studying complex traits often fail to account for
          gene-gene interactions, which are critical for understanding disease
          progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates transcriptome-wide association
          studies with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation. This approach allows us to contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential drug targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules. Overall, our study highlights the
          importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          and drug discovery, and provides a novel computational approach for
          identifying potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The study of genes and their interactions with each other is an
          essential area of research in understanding complex traits and disease
          mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          identify individual genes associated with diseases, recent models
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease
          origin and progression. This gap in the literature calls for a more
          comprehensive approach to identify gene-trait associations and
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In this
          manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility
          of PhenoPLIER in identifying functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. Overall, our study provides a
          novel computational approach to identify gene-trait associations and
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, which has broader
          significance for developing new therapies and understanding complex
          disease mechanisms.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits is
              critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify individual genes involved
              in disease mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. To address this challenge,

              functionally important players lack associations but are

              Genetic studies have long sought to understand the complex
              interplay between genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              However, current methods are limited in their ability to account
              for gene-gene interactions and the contextual regulation of
              expression patterns across different conditions. To address this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses
              gene co-expression analysis to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,

              In recent years, there has been a growing interest in
              understanding the complex interactions between genes and how they
              influence disease development and progression. However,
              traditional approaches to studying gene expression patterns across
              different conditions have limitations, as they often focus on
              individual genes rather than their interactions with other genes.
              In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is based on the idea that genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions are likely
              to be involved in similar biological processes, allowing us to
              identify potential drug targets and mechanisms of action. We
              demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case
              studies, including a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, which
              revealed important players that lacked associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of
              complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. Overall, our work
              highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
              disease research and demonstrates the value of computational
              approaches for identifying potential drug targets and mechanisms
              of action.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genetic studies have been instrumental in uncovering disease
              mechanisms and identifying potential drug targets. However, a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions is critical for developing effective
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped identify individual genes associated with disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our study highlights
              the importance of gene expression regulation in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms and demonstrates the utility of computational
              approaches for identifying potential therapeutic targets.

              The study of genes in complex systems requires an understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions to determine
              their influence on disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide

              Gene expression regulation is critical for the development of
              complex traits, including disease mechanisms. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
              individual genes involved in disease-relevant processes, modern
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through an analysis of
              lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, where we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the
              importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in
              understanding gene-gene interactions and their role in disease
              mechanisms. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel approach to
              contextualizing genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              for new therapies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

              The study of genes acting in concert with each other is crucial

              Gene expression plays a crucial role in complex traits, but
              determining how these genes interact with each other across
              different conditions is challenging. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify individual genes
              associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are
              critical for disease origin and progression. To address this gap
              in our understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, which we observe
              are significantl associated with diseases in relevant cell types.
              We find that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets that could be
              prioritized for further investigation. Overall, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for understanding gene-gene
              interactions in complex traits, which has important implications
              for disease prediction and drug discovery.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational tool that
              integrates gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation
              information to generate a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is based on the identification of modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across different
              conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              can contextualize genetic associations by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes. By doing so, we reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each
              other to perform their functions in specific contexts.
              Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. Our study highlights the critical role of
              gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression, which
              has been predicted by modern models of complex trait architecture.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
              insights into the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, our approach provides a more comprehensive
              understanding of the genetic associations by integrating gene
              expression data with pharmacological perturbation information.
              This integration enables us to identify potential therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing opportunities. Our findings provide a
              foundation for future studies on disease etiology and drug
              mechanism, which will ultimately lead to the development of new
              therapies.

              The field of genetic studies is rapidly evolving, and functional
              genomics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding how
              genes interact with each other and contribute to disease
              development. However, the complexity of gene-gene interactions
              makes it challenging to identify therapeutic targets or predict
              drug repurposing. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that bridges the gap between gene
              expression patterns and disease etiology by identifying modules of
              genes with similar expression profiles in relevant cell types. Our
              analysis reveals that diseases are associated with these gene
              modules, which can be used to predict drug-disease pairs and infer
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate how PhenoPLIER
              can prioritize functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack direct associations. By
              contextualizing genetic associations through gene co-expression
              analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies. Our approach has broader
              significance by providing a framework for drug repurposing and
              identifying novel therapeutic targets in complex diseases.

              The field of genetics has long been interested in understanding
              how genes interact with each other to produce complex traits.
              However, current models of the architecture of complex traits do
              not fully capture the complexity of these interactions. In this
              manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This

              a novel approach to understanding how genes interact with each

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene expression patterns and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions and observes that
              diseases are significantly associated with these modules in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. In addition, we use a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach
              provides a valuable tool for understanding how genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, which is critical for developing new therapies.

              The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
              identifying disease-associated genes, but the complexity of these
              diseases often requires a more nuanced approach to understanding
              their underlying mechanisms. The use of functional genomics
              techniques such as gene co-expression analysis can provide
              valuable insights into how genes interact with each other and
              contribute to complex traits. However, current methods for
              integrating gene expression data with other types of genomic and
              clinical data are limited by the lack of a common representation
              that can capture the relationships between these different types
              of information.


              To address this gap in the literature, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several
              case studies, including the prediction of known drug-disease pairs
              and the identification of functionally important players in lipid
              regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the importance of
              considering gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, and suggest that our approach could be used to
              identify new therapeutic targets for complex diseases.


              Overall, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the
              field of genetic studies by providing a common representation that
              can capture the relationships between different types of genomic
              and clinical data. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              our method provides a more nuanced understanding of complex traits
              and their underlying mechanisms, which is critical for developing
              new therapies.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that integrates gene expression data with genetic studies to
              identify potential therapeutic targets for complex diseases. Our
              approach leverages modules of genes that exhibit similar
              expression patterns across different conditions, and we
              demonstrate that diseases are associated with these modules in
              relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by prioritizing
              functionally important players in trait-associated modules. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our method can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the
              importance of understanding expression regulation across different
              conditions to develop new therapies for complex diseases. We show
              that transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
              modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. Therefore, our method
              provides a novel approach to identifying drug repurposing
              opportunities by clustering complex traits based on gene
              expression patterns.

              The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in
              recent years with functional genomics approaches highlighting gene
              co-expression patterns as potential therapeutic targets for
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the current
              state-of-the-art lacks a comprehensive approach that can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. In this manuscript, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis of complex traits. Our
              approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, and we observe that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              can provide a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of gene
              co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
              and provide a new tool for identifying therapeutic targets and
              repurposing drugs. By filling this gap in the current literature,
              our work has broader significance for the development of
              personalized medicine and precision therapies.

              The field of genetics has made significant strides in recent
              years, with transcriptome-wide association studies revealing
              individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease origin and
              progression. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This reveals the importance of
              understanding gene expression regulation across different
              conditions to determine how genes influence complex traits and
              develop new therapies. In conclusion, our approach provides a
              valuable tool for studying disease mechanisms and drug discovery,
              filling a gap in the current literature by integrating gene-gene
              interactions into the analysis of complex traits.

              The field of functional genomics has revolutionized our
              understanding of how genetic variations contribute to disease risk
              and therapeutic response. However, existing methods have
              difficulty capturing the complex interplay between genes and
              traits, particularly when multiple genes are involved in a disease
              process. This manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
              identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across different conditions, and we show that diseases are
              significantly associated with these modules in relevant cell
              types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action, demonstrating its utility as a tool
              for drug repurposing and identifying novel therapeutic targets.
              Moreover, our approach highlights the importance of
              contextualizing genetic associations by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes. We illustrate this point using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, and that understanding these interactions is
              essential for developing new therapies. Overall, this work
              advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of complex traits and
              provides a powerful tool for drug discovery and repurposing.

              The field of computational biology has seen significant
              advancements in recent years, with transcriptome-wide association
              studies (TWAS) providing valuable insights into the role of
              individual genes in complex diseases. However, these studies often
              fail to capture the interactions between genes that are critical
              for understanding disease mechanisms. To address this gap, we have
              developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.


              Using PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This
              highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
              disease mechanisms and underscores the need for a more
              comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel approach to
              contextualizing genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, our approach can help uncover the role of
              gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms, which is critical
              for developing new therapies. Our findings highlight the
              importance of considering expression regulation across different
              conditions in understanding complex traits and underscore the need
              for more comprehensive models of disease mechanisms.

              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion

              Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression.

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in complex traits and

              understanding these patterns have limitations, particularly when

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of
              action, and identifying disease-associated gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Our findings highlight the importance of

              target discovery.

              Genetic studies have long been used to identify disease risk
              factors, but the complexity of gene interactions makes it
              difficult to determine how these factors contribute to disease
              development and progression. To address this challenge,
              researchers have turned to functional genomics approaches that
              analyze gene expression patterns across different conditions.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful
              in identifying individual genes associated with specific diseases,
              recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial

              In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do
              not act in isolation but rather work together in specific contexts

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe
            that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits
              requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This knowledge is critical for the
              development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes
              that play a role in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease etiology and
              progression. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important
              players that lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait

              In recent years, there has been a growing interest in
              understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits.
              However, the traditional approach of studying individual genes has
              limitations in predicting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To
              overcome this challenge, we propose a computational approach
              called PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on the
              idea that groups of co-expressed genes can provide contextual
              information that may be missed by single-gene strategies. In this
              study, we applied PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation in a CRISPR
              screen and found that functionally important players lack
              associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
              results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action,
              highlighting its importance in identifying therapeutic targets and
              repurposing drugs for complex traits. Overall, our work provides a
              novel computational tool that can bridge the gap between genetic
              studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic
              targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.

              The study of gene expression patterns has been instrumental in
              understanding how genes work together to perform specific
              functions in different contexts. This knowledge is critical for
              developing new therapies, as it provides insights into the
              mechanisms underlying complex traits. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped identify individual genes that are
              associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. The study
              finds that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and the approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, the study identifies functionally important players
              that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. The study introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. The study
              highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms, but the complex nature of these patterns
              makes it challenging to identify relevant genes and their
              interactions. Functional genomics techniques have been used to
              study gene-gene interactions, but they often fail to capture the
              contextual factors that influence expression regulation. In this
              manuscript, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness
              of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and show that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our approach provides
              a valuable tool for identifying therapeutic targets and
              repurposing drugs based on their mechanisms of action.

              Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the complexity of gene
              expression patterns has made it challenging to identify specific
              genes that contribute to complex traits. In this study, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach
              is based on the observation that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We
              demonstrate that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes. Furthermore, we show that PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the
              importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, and provide a novel tool for identifying therapeutic
              targets and repurposing drugs.

              Genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions in
              specific contexts, but determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. However, existing methods for analyzing gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data do not account
              for this complexity, missing potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies.


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In this study, we use PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation in a
              CRISPR screen. We find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules,
              highlighting the importance of considering gene-gene interactions
              in disease mechanisms. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing
              valuable insights into complex traits for therapeutic development.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the
              field, enabling researchers to better understand how genes
              interact to influence disease and identify potential targets for
              new therapies.

              Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of disease

              The study of complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across different conditions. While

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              The study of complex traits involves understanding the
              interactions between multiple genes and their impact on disease
              mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to genetic studies
              have focused primarily on individual gene associations with
              disease outcomes. This manuscript presents a novel computational
              approach called PhenoPLIER that addresses this gap by mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can

              missed by single-gene strategies. The authors demonstrate the
              effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through a variety of analyses,
              including the identification of disease-associated gene modules in
              relevant cell types and the prediction of known drug-disease

              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              Context: The study of complex traits involves understanding how
              genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining the influence of these genes on disease
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions, which has been shown to be critical
              for developing new therapies. However, current models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, highlighting a gap in our current understanding of
              complex traits.

              Content: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Conclusion: Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in

              insights into the role of gene-gene interactions in disease and
              highlight the importance of considering gene expression patterns
              in complex trait studies.

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are

              Gene expression plays a crucial role in the development and
              progression of complex traits, including diseases. However,
              current models of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a key role in disease origin and progression. To
              understand these interactions and identify potential targets for
              new therapies, researchers have been using transcriptome-wide
              association studies to uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these studies have
              limitations in identifying the contextual relationships between
              genes and traits.


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our approach uses modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our

              interactions and contextual relationships in understanding complex
              traits and developing new therapies. Overall, our approach
              provides a powerful tool for identifying potential targets and
              mechanisms of action in complex diseases.

              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes do not act in isolation, but rather work together in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how
              these genes influence complex traits requires a comprehensive
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing new
              therapies, and transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study demonstrates the

              Genetic studies have contributed significantly to our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet the
              complex nature of these phenomena often hinders their
              interpretation. To address this challenge, functional genomics
              approaches have been developed to identify gene-gene interactions
              that underlie disease development and progression. However,
              traditional methods for analyzing gene expression patterns are
              limited by their focus on individual genes and fail to account for
              the contextual relationships between them. In this manuscript, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression analysis to map genetic associations
              onto a common latent representation of gene modules and
              pharmacological perturbation data. By integrating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive
              understanding of disease mechanisms and identify potential
              therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
              PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally
              important players that lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. Overall, our work highlights the
              importance of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and

              Context: The field of genetics and disease research has made
              significant strides in recent years, with the identification of
              individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms through
              transcriptome-wide association studies. However, modern models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which
              requires a more comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This study aims to address
              this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis.


              Content: PhenoPLIER is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows it to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. The approach has been tested
              using disease association data and CRISPR screens, and the results
              show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action for functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.


              Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of incorporating
              gene-gene interactions in disease research and demonstrates how
              PhenoPLIER can provide valuable insights into complex traits. The
              findings suggest that disease-relevant mechanisms involve groups
              of co-expressed genes, which may have broader significance for
              drug discovery and development. Overall, this study contributes to
              our understanding of gene expression regulation and its role in
              disease pathogenesis.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
            PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
            known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
            Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
            find that functionally important players lack associations but are
            prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic

              Gene expression is critical for the development and progression of
              complex traits, including diseases. However, our understanding of
              how genes interact with each other and how these interactions
              influence disease mechanisms remains limited. To address this gap
              in the literature, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis.


              PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across conditions to contextualize genetic associations,
              revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action.


              To further validate our approach, we conducted a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of
              considering gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and
              demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can advance our understanding of
              complex traits.


              In conclusion, our study provides a novel computational approach
              for analyzing gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to identify potential targets and mechanisms of
              action in complex traits. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, we can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              demonstrate the importance of considering gene-gene interactions
              in disease mechanisms and provide a valuable tool for developing
              new therapies.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are

              Genetic studies have been instrumental in uncovering the
              mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug action. However,
              traditional approaches to studying complex traits often fail to
              account for gene-gene interactions, which are critical for
              understanding disease progression. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation. This
              approach allows us to contextualize genetic associations and
              identify potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of
              PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              where functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, our study
              highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
              disease etiology and drug discovery, and provides a novel
              computational approach for identifying potential therapeutic
              targets and mechanisms of action.

              The study of genes and their interactions with each other is an
              essential area of research in understanding complex traits and
              disease mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped identify individual genes associated with diseases,
              recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical
              role in disease origin and progression. This gap in the literature
              calls for a more comprehensive approach to identify gene-trait
              associations and potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational tool that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly

              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the
              utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying functionally important
              players that lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation. Overall, our study provides a novel computational
              approach to identify gene-trait associations and potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, which has broader significance
              for developing new therapies and understanding complex disease
              mechanisms.
